It is however not clear how well different propositionalization methods work in conjunction with different standard machine learning algorithms. Three different graph 
propositionalization methods are investigated in conjunction with three standard learning algorithms: random forests support vector machines and nearest neighbor classifiers An experiment on 21 datasets from the domain of medicinal chemistry shows that the choice of propositionalization method may have a significant impact on the resulting accuracy. The empirical investigation further shows that for datasets from this domain, the use of the maximal frequent item set approach for propositionalization results in the most accurate classifiers, significantly outperforming the

INTRODUCTION  Standard machine learning algorithms require data to be represented in an attribute-value format, where the examples are represented using feature vectors of fixed length [1 w e v e r, in  m a n y cases, relev a n t i n f o r m atio n  cannot easily be represented in a single table, since 
relations between the attributes are frequently occurring  T h eref ore, i n order t o appl y s t a n dard l earn i ng algorithms in such domains, either the relational aspects have to be omitted or some suitable transformation of the relations into an attribute-value format is required. To avoid loss of information, the latter approach should be adopted if possible, hence requiring an appropriate preprocessing method for including the structural information into the attribute-value format  Propositionalization concerns enabling propositional attribute-value\ers to handle relational learning problems  t y pical p r opos ition a lization  m e t h od results in a feature vector representation, where the

This study aims to shed more light on this question  Commonly employed datasets for evaluating machine learning methods, such as those in the UCI repository mostly concern non-relational problems and are hence not 
useful in large-scale evaluations of different graph propositionalization methods. In this study, we instead turn to the field of medicinal chemistry, in particular to the prediction of biological effects of chemical compounds. Several datasets from this domain are publicly available and they concern modeling tasks of various biochemical activities, such as absorption distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity ADMET\0 W h at is p a rticu l arl y  in tere sti n g  w i th t h e s e  datasets from our perspective is that chemical compounds

are naturally represented as graphs, and hence they could serve as a test bed for propositionalization methods. In this study, we will empirically evaluate propositionalization methods when used in conjunction with different standard machine learning algorithms on datasets from the domain of medicinal chemistry  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the three graph propositionalization approaches that will be evaluated in this study are presented. In section three, the experimental setup for the evaluation of these methods in the domain of medicinal chemistry is presented. In section four, the experimental results are shown and analyzed, and finally, the main conclusions and directions for future work are given in section five  II.    GRAPH PROPOSITIONALIZATION METHODS  Graphs are natural data structures for structured or relational data, where nodes represent objects and edges represent relations. For example, a dataset containing web data may be represented as a set of graphs, where the nodes represent web pages and the edges represent links between the web pages. The graph propositionalization methods we consider in this study assume that nodes and edges are labeled, e.g., a node representing a web page could be labeled ‘student’, while an edge representing a link could be labeled ‘title’. We follow the graph propositionalization approach in [6 y  w h ich each  example is represented by a set of triples on the form L i L j E k  such that there is an edge, which has a label E k  in the graph of the example between nodes i and j that are labeled L i and L j  respectively. Following u c h a s et is  referred to as a fingerprint We further assume that each fingerprint has been assigned a class label, e.g., ‘positive or ‘negative  The graph propositionalization me thods considered in this study generate feature vectors where each feature corresponds to a sub-graph. We have selected two stateof-the-art methods for sub-graph mining; SUBDUE [11  and MOSS U BD U E i s a g e n e ri c m e t h od f o r s u b graph discovery, while MOSS is a domain-specific subgraph discovery method for chemo-informatics. In this study, we also consider another domain-independent graph propositionalization method that uses the algorithm for maximal frequent itemset mining t h e   fingerprint representation described above. All these three methods, which are described below, may take labeled graphs as input  SUBDUE SUBDUE s a g r ap h bas e d kn o w l e dg e  discovery system that finds structural and relational patterns in data representing entities and relationships SUBDUE represents relational data using labeled directed graphs, where the entities are represented by labeled vertices or sub-graphs, and relationships are represented by labeled edges between the entities [11 It uses the minimum description length \(MDL\rinciple to measure the interestingness of the sub-graphs discovered SUBDUE employs a step-by-step procedure, which starts from single nodes and performs a computationally constrained beam search in order to expand it by another node or edge, which results in a sub-graph. Therefore it typically generates a small number of sub-graphs that best compress the dataset. We have chosen SUBDUE as a reference method, since it is publicly available and the sub-graphs discovered by SUBDUE could be used as propositional\features for standard machine learning algorithms. We have used the implementation of SUBDUE described in In order t o di s c ov er s u bgraphs efficiently, we have used the parameters eval=2  and prune as described in [15    MOSS MOSS s  an algorithm that can be used for discovering frequent molecular fragments in chemoinformatics databases. In doing so, MOSS also views molecules as graphs, where the atoms are the nodes and the bonds between atoms are the edges of the graph. The molecular fragment discovery algorithm of MOSS discovers molecular fragments that are referred to as subgraphs, which best separate molecules that belong to different classes. The MOSS algorithm searches for arbitrarily connected sub-graphs, avoiding frequent embeddings of previously discovered sub-graphs by using a specific search strategy. The algorithm maintains parallel embeddings of a fragment into all molecules throughout the growth process and exploits a local order of the atoms and bonds of a fragment to effectively prune the search tree, which allows for a restricted depth-first search algorithm, similar to the Eclat association rule mining algorithm SS s e l ect s  su bs t r u c t u res t h at  have a certain minimum support in a given set of molecules, i.e., are part of at least a certain percentage of the molecules. However, in order to restrict the search space, the algorithm considers only connected substructures, i.e., sub-graphs containing nodes that are connected to at least one other node. Similar to SUBDUE MOSS has been included as a reference method, since it is publicly available and appears to be suitable in particular for the medicinal chemistry domain, where the frequent fragments discovered by MOSS can be used as features. The publicly available implementation of MOSS is used in our experiments together with the default parameter settings [16    Supervised maximum frequent itemsets \(SMFI The popular Apriori algorithm for finding association rules was first introduced in [17 T h is alg o rith m is b a sed o n  analyzing common item sets in a set of transactions which is technically referred to as frequent itemset

mining. The search space of this problem, which is all frequent item sets, is typically huge. Several approaches to efficiently explore the search space have been proposed that only consider a sufficiently large subset of all frequent itemsets. Among these, methods for finding the set of all closed or maximal itemsets are the most popular  i v e n bel o w i s  t h e de f i n i t i on of  f r equ e n t i t e m s et  mining and maximal frequent itemset mining   Definition maximal frequent itemset Suppose we are given a set of items I which is a set of literals. An itemset I  002  I is some subset of items. For itemset I a transaction including I is called an occurrence of I The denotation of I denoted by T\(I is the set of the occurrences of I. |T \(I is called the frequency of I and denoted by frq\(I For a given constant 003 called a minimum support itemset I is frequent if frq\(I 000 003 If a frequent itemset I is included in no other frequent itemset I is called maximal   When adapting this method for feature selection, a triplet  L i L j E k cribed above is considered as an item in the itemset and a fingerprint is considered as a single transaction. Therefore, the maximal frequent item set l I  002  I l  is defined in such a way that I l is the collection of all triples in the input graphs with respect to the class l  The maximal frequent itemset with respect to class l is generated using maximal frequent item set mining algorithm as defined in [14 T h e co llectio n o f all th e  discovered maximum frequent itemsets 000 n l I 1 with respect to each class are taken together as the feature set discovered by the method. This approach is an extension to the unsupervised way of finding maximal frequent itemsets in [19  w h ic h co n s i d ered all th e in p u t g r ap h s i n  the maximal frequent itemset mining algorithm irrespective of the class  In the experiments, we have used the maximal frequent itemset mining algorithm as implemented in MAFIA [18   together with 6 levels of support, namely 0.5, 0.4, 0.2 0.1, 0.025 and 0.01. SMFI does not have an inbuilt pruning method, similar to the MDL principle employed in SUBDUE or minimum support employed in MOSS Instead, discrete levels of support are applied, which may not be fully optimal. The training set is partitioned into subsets according to class membership and the maximal frequent itemset mining algorithm is applied to each of these subsets of examples separately. The discovered itemsets with respect to all the classes are combined together as the feature set. 10-fold cross-validation is employed on the training set to investigate which of the above parameter setting gives the highest accuracy, and this level of support is used for generating a model from the entire training set  III.   EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  A. Methods The feature sets generated by each of the three propositionalization methods, SUBDUE, MOSS and SMFI, which were described in the previous section, are used in conjunction with three popular machine learning algorithms, as implemented in the WEKA data mining toolkit a m e l y ran d o m f o res t s RF  21], s u pport  vector machines \(the SMO algorithm d th e k nearest neighbor algorithm T h e n u m b er of tree s  generated by the random forest algorithm is set to 50. The parameters for the SMO algorithm are the RBF kernel with complexity 2. The IBk algorithm with the number of nearest neighbors k = 3 is used as the nearest neighbor classifier. We consider accuracy as the performance criterion, which is estimated using 10-fold crossvalidation   B.   Data sets 21 publicly available compound sets from the domain of medicinal chemistry s ed to tes t th e nu ll  hypothesis, i.e., there is no difference in performance between the propositionalization methods. The compounds in each set have associated binary class labels, representing whether a molecule is active or not with respect to some measure of biological activity. The compounds in these datasets are represented by graphs i.e., each atom in a molecule is a node of the corresponding graph and the arcs represent bonds among atoms  It has been suggested in the past, e.g., in h at us i ng the domain specific feature sets in conjunction with the machine learning approaches could help increasing the classifier accuracy. Therefore in addition to the features generated by the propositionalization methods, we also have used publicly available chemical descriptors as input features in conjunction with the generated features. The SELMA c ri pt ors con s i s t o f 94 di f f e re n t  g l obal  properties of molecules and the Scitegic Extended Connectivity Fingerprints \(ECFI c ripto r s con s ist  of presence and non-presence of 1024 different molecular fragments. These descriptors are represented in attributevalue format and they have been used in conjunction with the feature sets generated by the three graph propositionalization methods

IV.   EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  The results from employing 10-fold cross-validation on the 21 data sets using the standard random forest algorithm, support vector machines and the nearest neighbor classifier in conjunction with the three different propositionalization methods are shown in Table I, II and III below. Each of the three tables corresponds to one of the learning algorithms, and the names of the data sets are given in the first column of each table. The subsequent columns contain results for the three propositionalization methods, when these features are used on their own generated features only\when they are used in conjunction with SELMA descriptors \(features+selma and together with the ECFI descriptors \(features+ecfi respectively  A.     Hypothesis tests  In testing the null hypothesis, the predictive performances of the three learning algorithms are analyzed separately For each algorithm, the results of different feature sets i.e., generated features only, features+selma and features+ecfi, are also analyzed separately.  Therefore the same null hypothesis is tested in nine cases. For each case, the significance of the differences of the accuracies yielded by the three propositionalization methods is tested using the Friedman test T h e accu racies of th e th ree  methods are ranked and the average ranks are used for pair-wise tests accordin propos ition a lizatio n method that fails to produce a feature set is assigned the lowest rank. Table IV gives the ranking of each method for all the nine cases. A single case corresponds to one feature set given in column 1 and one learning algorithm given in column 3, 4 or 5. Therefore the ranks given in Table IV are the relative performance of SMFI, SUBDUE and MOSS for the respective feature set and classifier algorithm  Table IV: AVERAGE RANKINGS OF THE THREE METHODS  Method RF SMO IBk Features only smfi 1.24 1.10  1.30 subdue 2.14 2.24 2.10 moss 2.62 2.67 2.62 Features Selma smfi 1.50 1.60 1.64 subdue 2.21 2.26 1.76 moss 2.29 2.14 2.60 Features+ecfi smfi 1.83 1.74 1.64 subdue 1.83 2.14 1.76 moss 2.33 2.12 2.60  The null hypothesis is not rejected when the generated features are used with the ECFI descriptors in conjunction with random forests and support vector machines. The pairs of methods for which one can conclude that there is a significant difference of ranks is summarized in Table V below.  The winning method is given in boldface in Table V   TABLE V: RESULTS OF PAIR-WISE STATISTICAL TESTS FOR THE THREE PROPOSITIONALIZATION METHODS   It is interesting to note that the classifier accuracy for SMFI is significantly better than for SUBDUE and MOSS, when the features generated by the methods are considered alone in the classification \(features only\he differences between the methods are not as emphasized when they are considered in conjunction with existing chemical descriptors. In particular, the differences are not significant at all when the ECFI descriptors are used with random forests and SMO  The method SMFI was able to discover at least one important feature with respect to all the 21 datasets whereas SUBDUE and MOSS fails to do so for some datasets. It is worth noting that MOSS could not discover any feature for 6 out of 21 datasets, which is also reflected by its low performance. One reason for the inability to generate features in some cases could be that MOSS considers only sub-graphs that are connected.  In contrast the discovered patterns of SUBDUE could contain even a single node, while the feature discovery approach of SMFI naturally allows discovering sets of sub-graphs that are not connected. For example, a feature discovered by SMFI such as {S-c, c-O, c-c, c-N, c-c}, which is a collection of molecular fragments, could either be interconnected or disconnected. The other two methods will not include such a set of sub-graphs in one feature. The success of SMFI indicates that features of this type may be quite important for the type of datasets considered in this study. It is also worthwhile to note that SMFI is a naïve kernel which simply computes the average kernel between all pairs of edges. [8 su gge st s t h a t s u c h a  na  v e  kernel could perform comparable to sophisticated kernel methods   V.    CONCLUDING REMARKS  Graph propositionalization methods can be used as preprocessing methods for standard machine learning algorithms, transforming structured data into fixed-length feature vectors.

methods, MOSS, SUBDUE and SMFI, have been studied in conjunction with three standard machine learning algorithms, namely random forests, support vector machines and nearest neighbor classifiers. An empirical evaluation on 21 data sets from the domain of medicinal chemistry showed that the choice of propositionalization method may have a significant impact on the resulting accuracy. The experiment further showed that the SMFI method outperformed the other two graph propositionalization methods, SUBDUE and MOSS, for all the three learning algorithms that were considered in this study  As a further improvement to the graph propositionalization using SMFI, one could employ a suitable technique for finding the optimal threshold for the mfi algorithm in  T h is con t ras t s to t h e approach em plo y ed i n t h is  study, which selects parameter values from a finite set based on cross-validation on the training set. It could also be interesting to investigate the classifier performance with different feature sets merged in one feature vector For example, different molecular descriptors, features discovered by subgraphs, kernels, ILP or boosting methods could be used in one such feature vector Another direction for future work, which would be interesting from a medicinal chemistry perspective, is to compare the predictive performance of the classifiers obtained from using only the existing molecular descriptors to those generated from the extended feature sets, and investigate to what extent QSAR modeling with the standard molecular descriptors could be improved by using them in conjunction with graph propositionalization methods. One other possible direction for further studies is to carry out a similar experiment on data from other domains, such as web document classification. One could also combine different feature sets derived by different feature discovery methods and investigate in which way the combinations of such feature set affect the performance  REFERENCES 1   Eibe Frank, Mark A.Hall, Geoffrey Holmes, Richard Kirkby Bernhard Pfahringer, and I.

results show that excluding itemset supports below minsup generally has little effect on clustering results particular for smaller values of minsup However there is some degradation in metric values for higher levels of minsup Here 223degradation\224 means that metric values are smaller when some itemset supports are excluded corresponding to a poorer clustering match to frequent itemsets We offer the following interpretation for the minsup dependent degradation in clustering metric Members of frequent itemsets are typically frequently cited documents overall Such frequently cited documents are likely to appear in many itemsets even less frequent itemsets Thus there are likely to be many itemsets below minsup that contain these frequently cited documents Excluding itemsets below minsup then removes the supports that these itemsets contribute to the summations in computing hybrid distances 5 Summary and Conclusions We have proposed a new methodology for visualizing association mining results A central component in the methodology is a new class of inter-item distances computed directly from itemset supports While the distances are computed from supports of itemsets of arbitrary cardinality they still retain a simple pairwise structure These hybrid pairwisehigher-cardinality distances thus allow the direct application of standard visualization tools such as clustering dendrograms However they require much less complex user interaction compared to that of working directly with all frequent itemsets The hybrid distances are computationally feasible via fast algorithms for computing frequent itemsets We provided a theoretical guarantee that under the new hybrid distances consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets is attainable independent of the clustering criterion We proposed the application of the hierarchical clustering dendrogram for association mining visualization which enables quick comprehension of complex distance relationships among items We also introduced new augmentations of the dendrogram to support the visual mining process by adding item descriptive text and graphical symbols for members of frequent itemsets We tested the effects of our new hybrid distances on hierarchical clustering dendrograms for large numbers of test cases with data extracted from the Science Citation Index In particular we compared dendrograms between a variety of hybrid distance formulas and standard pairwise distances in terms of a metric that measures consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets For the majority of the test cases metric values were higher for our hybrid distances indicating better consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets We also conducted experiments showing that excluding itemset supports below some minimum value has relatively little effect on itemset/cluster consistency so that it is reasonable to apply fast algorithms for computing the frequent itemsets needed for the hybrid distances This is the first known application of clustering for the visualizing association mining results The pairwise structure of the new hybrid inter-item distances allows the visualization of frequent itemsets of arbitrary cardinalities The nonlinear transformation of itemset supports helps ensure consistency between clusters and important frequent itemsets making frequent itemsets less likely to be obscured during visualization As a more basic contribution this work represents a first step towards the unification of association mining and clustering visualization 6 References l M Henzinger 223Link Analysis in Web Information Retrieval,\224 Bulletin of the Technical Committee on Data Engineering 23 special issue on Next-Generation Web Search pp 3-8 September 2000  J Kleinberg, \223Authoritative Sources in a Hyperlinked Environment,\224 in Proceedings of the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms January 1998, pp 3 H Small 223Co-citation in the Scientific Literature A New Measure of the Relationship Between Two Documents,\224 Journal of the American Society of Information Science 24 pp. 265-269, 1973 4 J Hartigan Clustering Algorithms John Wiley  Sons New York, 1975 5 R Agrawal T Imielinski A Swami 223Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases,\224 in Proceedings of the 1993 International Conference on the Management of Data Washington DC, May 1993, pp. 207-216 161 R Agrawal R Srikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules,\224 in Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Databases Santiago Chile September 1994, pp. 487-499 7 E Garfield Citation Index Its Theory and Application in Science Technology and Humanities John Wiley  Sons New York, 1979 8 H Small 223Macro-Level Changes in the Structure of Co-Citation Clusters 1983-1989,\224 Scientometrics 26 pp 5-20 1993 668-677 432 


which works off the circumstance lattice sweeping it level wise and is very expensive as well In the full paper we develop efficient algorithms for computing the Armstrong Basis suppressed here for lack of space 7 Discussion and Conclusions Recently there has been interest in mining long pattern s In this context algorithms for mining maximal frequent sets have been proposed Bay98 AAPOO This is relevant because of our interest in minimal circumstances However these algorithms operate in a different lattice and the mech anisms of the algorithms appear different Given our interest in the Armstrong Basis, these algorithms might offer yet an other way to efficiently find maximal frequent itemsets as sociated with a circumstance in that context The recent ly proposed FP-tree method HPYOO PHMOO has obvious relevance for circumstance mining and also for the compu tation of the Armstrong Basis We are currently exploring efficient algorithms for the Armstrong Basis based on the FP-tree method Finally as previously noted mining for cir cumstances in which a given pattern \(like frequent itemset holds has a close relationship with cube computation For lack of space we refer the reader to the recent paper BR99 which surveys many of the cube methods and which also describes the BUC algorithm In conclusion basing pattern mining on a clear sepa ration between item attributes and circumstance attributes pays its dividends the close ties with the cube computa tion paradigm and between cube computation and mining of i-anti-monotone patterns open up new and promising di rections for future work As motivated earlier, finding mini mal for c-monotone patterns circumstances under which a pattern holds for a specific itemset is useful in its own right The framework developed in this paper goes far beyondjust support-based mining of frequent itemsets This is achieved using properties of patterns on the bilattice of circumstances and itemsets Finally we proposed a useful notion of Arm strong Basis with which we can find \(say minimal circum stances where a pattern holds for an itemset and then find which other itemsets satisfy the pattern under these circum stances This is in the spirit of mining the result of min ing one of the important problems identified by Imielinski and Mannila in their seminal paper ImMa96 Just as data cube is an important operator for supporting queries involv ing multiple group-bys for queries involving migration be tween itemsets and circumstances Armstrong Basis can pro vide effective support More work is needed for its efficient computation and its use in answering such mining queries AS951 AAPOO R Agrawal and R Srikant Mining sequential pattem s ICDE\22295 pp 3-14 R Agrawal C C Aggarwal and V V V Prasad Depth first generation of long pattems KDD 2000 to appear R J Bayardo Efficiently mining long pattems from databases SIGMOD 22198 pp 85-93 K S Beyer, R Ramakrishnan: Bottom-Up Computa tion of Sparse and Iceberg CUBES SIGMOD 22299 pp S Brin R Motwani, and C.

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
