978-1-4244-2328-6/08 25.00 2008 IEEE A New Method for Mining Maximal Frequent Itemsets   Mohammad Nadimi-Shahraki, Norwati Mustapha, Md Nasir B Sulaiman, Ali B Mamat Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Putra Malaysia 43400, Selangor, Malaysia admin1@iaun.ac.ir, norwati nasir,ali}@fsktm.upm.edu.my   Abstract  In this paper, we propose a new method for mining maximal frequent itemsets. Our method introduces  an efficient database encoding technique a novel tree structure called PC_Tree and also PC_Miner algorithm. The database encoding technique utilizes Prime number characteristics and 
transforms each transaction into a positive integer that has all properties of its items. The PC_Tree is a simple tree structure but yet powerful to capture whole of transactions by one database scan. The PC_Miner algorithm traverses the PC_Tree and builds the gcd \(greatest common divisor\ set of its nodes to mine maximal frequent itemsets Experiments verify the efficiency and advantages of the proposed method  1. Introduction  Since the introduction of the Apriori algorithms 2  fr e q ue nt p a t t e r n  mi ni n g p l a y s a n i m p o r t a nt r o l e  in data mining research 
 The problem of mining all frequent itemsets is that if there is a large frequent itemset with size L, then almost all 2 L candidate subsets of the items might be generated. There are many contributions to enhance performance of mining all frequent itemsets. They have been mostly done base on three basic frequent itemsets mining methodologies: Apriori, FP-growth and Eclat In real application, the number of frequent itemsets produced from a transaction database can be very huge and it becomes impossible to find all 
frequent itemsets r eas on able s o l u tion i s  identifying a small representative set of itemsets from which all other frequent itemsets can be derived. Since frequent itemsets are upward closed it is sufficient to find out only all maximal frequent itemsets \(MFI  In particular, maximal frequent itemsets are those itemsets that are frequent but none of their supersets are frequent. Maximal frequent itemsets provide a compact representation of frequent itemsets effectively. In fact, they form the smallest set of itemsets from which all frequent 
itemsets can be derive In this research, we propose a new method to discover maximal frequent itemsets. Our method introduces an efficient database encoding technique a tree structure called P rime-based encoded and C ompressed T ree or PC_Tree and also PC_Miner algorithm. The database encoding technique utilizes prime numbers characteristics and transforms transaction database to a flat file called Encoded file which each transaction presents by a positive integer. The experiments shows that by applying this 
database encoding technique, the size of transaction database can be reduced more than half. The PC_Tree is a novel and simple tree structure but yet efficient consists of a root and some sub trees as the children of the root to capture whole of transactions by one database scan. The PC_Miner algorithm traverses the PC_Tree and prunes search space using the PC_Tree properties. It builds gcd \(greatest common divisor  set of the nodes of the tree which are in search space to mine maximal frequent itemsets The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 introduces the basic concepts and reviews 
some related works. The PC_Tree and the PC_Miner are described in section 3.  The experimental results show in section 4 and section 5 contains some conclusions and future works  2. Preliminaries and Related work  Let DB be a transaction database and X be the set of items from 1 to n. An itemset X is frequent if it contains at least transactions, where is the minimum support. An itemset X is a maximal frequent itemset if it is a frequent itemset and no superset of it is also a frequent itemset 
When the frequent patterns are long, mining all frequent itemsets is infeasible because of the exponential number of frequent itemsets Researchers now turn to find Maximal Frequent Itemsets \(MFI  B ecau s e  m i n i ng of MFI is f a s t er and all frequent itemsets can be built up from MFI and can be counted for support in a single scan of the database. Moreover, we can focus on any part of the MFI to do supervise data mining 


978-1-4244-2328-6/08 25.00 2008 IEEE Many efficient algorithms have been developed for mining maximal frequent itemsets in static database that mostly using the horizontal or vertical database layout. The Pincer-Search algorithm uses horizontal data format. The Pincer-Search algorithm combines a bottom-up and a top down techniques to find the maximal frequent itemsets The bottom up process finds frequent itemsets, and non frequent itemsets. Then non frequent itemsets are used by a top down process to refine a set of potential maximal frequent itemsets. MaxMiner [4 is another algorithm for finding the maximal elements. It uses a breadth-first traversal of the search space; and reduces database scanning by using a look ahead pruning strategy. DepthProject demonstrated an order of magnitude improvement over previous algorithms for mining maximal frequent itemsets o th Depth P ro j ect an d Maf i a  i n e a s u pers et o f t h e M F I, an d requ ire a pos tpruning to eliminate non-maximal patterns. Recently a new two-way-hybrid algorithm for mining maximal frequent itemsets has been proposed [6  flexible two-way-hybrid search method is given. The two-way-hybrid search begins the mining procedure in both the top-down and bottom-up directions at the same time. Moreover, information gathered in the bottom-up can be used to prune the search space in the other top down direction. The experiments showed that pruning strategies are implied in this method, can reduce the original search space  3. The Proposed Method  3.1. The Database Encoding  The presentation and encoding of database is an important consideration in almost all algorithms The most commonly used layout is the horizontal database layout and vertical on bot h layouts, the size of the database is very large In our algorithm, transaction database is transformed to a new presentation by database encoding in a data pre-processing phase. Database encoding is a useful technique which can reduce the size of database and improve the efficiency of mining. In this research, instead of maintaining a large table in the transaction database, one encoded file is considered. The encoded file is a flat file created by the database encoding technique as a new presentation of transaction database. The encoded file includes positive integers called Value. Every Value presents the entire items that occur in the transaction. In fact, all items in one transaction are converted into only one positive integer that has all properties of these items. Our database encoding technique makes use of prime number characteristics An integer P is a prime integer or prime number if P 1 and only positive divisors of P are 1 and P A positive integer N can be expressed as a product of prime numbers and this factorization is unique except for the order of the factors. Let p 1 p 2 p r  be the distinct prime factors of N so that p 1  p 2   p r All repeated factors can be collected together and expressed using exponents, such that N  p 1 m 1  p 2 m 2  p r m r where each m i  is a positive integer called the multiplicity of p i and this factorization of N is called the standard form of N  o r ex am ple  N 1800=2 3   3 2  5 2 For our purposes, we are particularly interested in multiplicity m i  1 because there is no duplicated item in transactions To facilitate the process of the database encoding technique used in our method, let’s examine it through an example. Let the transaction database DB be the first two columns of Table 1 with six transactions and item set I= {A, C, D, T, W  Table 1. The transaction database and its V TID  TID Items Encoded V TID  1 A,C,T,W 2,3,7,11 462 2 C,D,W 3,5,11 165 3 A,C,T,W 2,3,7,11 462 4 A,C,D,W 2,3,5,11 330 5 A,C,D,T,W 2,3,5,7,11 2310 6 C,D,T 3,5,7 105  Each item i j is presented by one prime number P j  as shown in third column of Table 1. We used very simple equation \(1\ compute value V TID for every transaction. In fact equation \(1\makes a new composite integer by  using the prime numbers. The V TID is product all considered prime numbers according to participated ite ms in the transaction For example for fourth transaction where itemsets A, C, D, W} using equation \(1 V 4 2*3*5*11=330  V TID  P i 1  The fourth column of Table 1 shows computed V TID for all transactions. By this way, the Encoded file is much smaller can be loaded into memory more easily than the original transaction database  3.2. The PC_Tree & PC_Miner algorithms  It this research, we introduce a novel and simple tree structure called P rime-based encoded and C ompressed T ree or PC_Tree. Mostly, researchers have proposed tree structure in static and incremental frequent itemset mining at  


978-1-4244-2328-6/08 25.00 2008 IEEE motivate us to introduce a simple tree structure but yet efficient A PC_Tree is a tree structure consists of a root and some sub trees as the children of the root Node’s structure in the tree has three fields: Value Count, and Link. The Value field records which transaction this node represents, the Count field registers the number of records reaching this value Database encoding and tree construction can be done with together by only one database scan  Figure 1. The PC_Tree for Table 1  To illustrate the construction of the PC_Tree figure 1 shows the PC_Tree for table 1. Firstly, the root node is created and it is considered that all Values can be as a divisor for root node. Then PC_Tree construction algorithm read a Value from Encoded file called next and calls the function Tree_construction. The function Tree_construction is performed such that every child node can divide its parent node for example 165 and 330 and if the next is equal value of the current node then current node’s count is increased by 1 like 462:2 The PC_Tree has some nice properties as described below Property 1 Nodes are arranged according to V TID  order, which is a fixed global ordering Property 2  The frequency of itemsets X registered in node N is equal the sum all Count field of N-tree sub tree from root to N\ example frequency of itemset X= {ACTW} or Value=462 is equal 1+2=3 As a good result, there is no need to database scan for counting of itemsets and its subset that registered in the PC_Tree Property 3  According to property 2, the frequency of itemset X registered in node N is less than frequency of itemset Y registered in node M where M is a child of N in the PC_Tree  Property 4 Given as minimum support and Y is a child for X in the PC_Tree, If Count \(Y  and Count \(X then Y is a Maximal Frequent itemset As showed in section 3.1, the output of the database encoding phase is the Encoded file includes all V TID for 0< TID < |D| where |D| is number of transactions. Therefore in the worst case, maximum number of nodes in the PC_Tree is |D Let us introduce our PC_Miner algorithm and show how it mines MFI. The PC_Miner utilizes gcd theory. The greatest common divisor  of two integers a and b not both zero, is the largest of the common divisors of a and b it is denoted gcd a  b or example, gcd \(24, 30\cd \(5, 7\d gcd \(0 9\= 9. If a and b are not both 0, then gcd a  b an integer between 1 and min a  b  The PC_Miner algorithm traverses the PC_Tree and builds gcd sets to find the MFI. It prunes search space using the properties of the PC_Tree For example, Given the transaction database shown in Table 1 which its PC_Tree shown in Fig 1 and let 3 According to the PC_Tree properties and gcd set used in PC_Miner algorithm, node 462:1+2 \(or itemset ACTW\d node 165:1+1+1 or itemset CDW\ will be discovered as MFI  4. Experimental Results  In this section, we evaluate the performance of our method. All the experiments are performed on PC with CPU Intel P4 2.8 GHz, 1 Gigabytes main memory, and running Microsoft Windows XP. All the algorithms are implemented using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 In first experiment, the Synthetic data are generated using IBM data generator which has been used in most studies on frequent itemsets mining We generate five datasets with number of items 1000, average transaction length 10 and number of transaction 1000 to 10000 that called D1, D2, D4 D8, and D10 respectively. In these experiments, our database encoding technique shows that it can reduce the size of these datasets more than half as shown in Figure 2. Most important result is, in our technique a prime number is considered for each item independent of the size of items. Obviously the size of items in real transaction databases is bigger than the size of items in benchmark datasets. It means our database encoding technique can be more efficient for reducing the size of real transaction database In second experiment, we show accuracy and correctness of the PC_Miner. The test dataset T10.I6.D10K is also generated synthetically by the IBM data generator. Figure 3 shows the numbers of maximal frequent itemsets discovered for the tests at varying minimal supports on this dataset     0 2 4 6 8 D1 D2 D4 D8 D10 Size of dataset \(100 KB Original dataset Encoded dataset  Figure 2.

Conclusions and future work  In this paper, we proposed a new method to discover maximal frequent itemsets efficiently. Our method introduces an efficient database encoding technique, a tree structure called P rime-based encoded and C ompressed T ree or PC_Tree and also PC_Miner algorithm. The experiments showed the database encoding technique can reduce the size of transaction database more than half. And also PC_Miner algorithm can discover all MFI using this encoding Optimizing our method by using better pruning method and memory management has been considered the future works. Then, we will improve our method for incremental updating of frequent itemsets where transaction database is updated or minimum support threshold can be change  6.

A property that is often used in the proof of is when adapted to gradual itemsets let P be a gradual itemset and  i v  62 P be a gradual item Then g  P  f  i v  g   g  P   g  f  i v  g   This property is not demonstrated in however it comes from Theorem 1 in where the set of sequences output by g is encoded into a binary matrix Thanks to the ppc-extension for gradual itemsets we can write a mining algorithm similar to LCM We present our GLCM algorithm in Algorithm 2 For simplicity and performance reasons we have decided to represent gradual items as integers instead of pairs A gradual item  i v  will be encoded by the integer enc  i v  such as enc  i v   032 2 i if  i v    i   2 i  1 if  i v    i   The even integers representing positive ascending variations and the odd integers representing negative descending variations With this encoding we force the items of I to be 0  n 000   with a renaming if necessary With such a coding of gradual items ppc-extension for gradual itemsets is even closer of ppc-extension for itemsets point i and iii are strictly identical where i stands for the encoding of a gradual item and core i is applied on encoded gradual itemsets and returns itself an integer code instead of an item To avoid confusion with item 0 we 002x core i     000 1  For point ii we have to check the encoded value of core i  If it is an even value of the form enc  i v   2 i  it means that the gradual itemset P contains  i    It would not make sense to try to extend P with enc  i v   1  2 i  1  corresponding to the gradual item  i    In this case we directly skip to enc  i v   2  i.e  i  1     This veri\002cation is handled in lines 18-22 of Algorithm 2 Lines 23-27 show the ppc-extension itself and are very similar to LCM The differences between LCM and GLCM lie 002rst in a small optimization speci\002c to gradual itemset in lines 14-15 Any gradual itemset representing co-variations items has a symmetric gradual itemset where the items are the same and the variations are all reversed For example the symmetric of f 1     2     3    g is f 1     2     3    g  supported by the same tid sequences but in the reverse order It is redundant to compute a gradual itemset and its opposite so we arbitrarily decided to compute only gradual itemsets whose 002rst variation is ascending they represent themselves and their opposite as well The computation of support in line 11 is standard for gradual itemsets we compute the longest transaction sequence supporting P  More interesting is the computation of closure shown in Algorithm 3 As a pre-processing at the initialization of the algorithm we compute for each gradual item the sequence of tuples corresponding to the order for that item line 3 in Algorithm 2 We then encode this sequence in a binary matrix in the same way as columns and lines represent tids If a transaction t i is before Algorithm 2 Algorithm GLCM 1 Input T transaction database  minimum support 2 for all gradual item  i v  2 I 002 f  g do 3 L enc  i;v   tid sorted in v order of item i value 4 B enc  i;v   bitmap matrix associated to L enc  i;v  5 end for 6 B  f B 1   B 2 002jIj g 7 for all gradual item encoding e 2 0  2 002 jIj 000  do 8 GlcmLoop  f e g  T  B    9 end for 10 Function GlcmLoop P closed gradual itemset T  B    11 if computeLongestPath P T  B    then 12 return  13 end if 14 if P  is odd then 15 return   Symmetrical itemset has already been tested 16 end if 17 output P  18 if  core i  P  is odd or  core i  P   000 1  then 19 k  core i  P  20 else 21 k  core i  P   1 22 end if 23 for e  k  1 to 2 002 jIj 000 1 do 24 Q  Clo  P  f e g  B   25 if P  e 000 1  Q  e 000 1 then 26 GlcmLoop Q T  B     27 end if 28 end for a transaction t j in the sequence then there is a 1 in the corresponding binary matrix This is a matrix encoding for graphs where the graph is simply the sequence of tids Example Let us consider a gradual itemset P supported by two lists of tuples tids  t 1  t 3  t 2  and  t 5  t 3  t 4   Then the binary matrix B P encoding these sequences is shown below Transaction id t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 1 1 1 1 0 0 t 2 0 1 0 0 0 t 3 0 1 1 1 0 t 4 0 0 0 1 0 t 5 0 0 1 1 1 The binary matrices contain all the necessary information to make the computations of the f and g closure functions as shown in Algorithm 3 Di Jorio et al ha v e sho wn that gi v en tw o gradual patterns P and Q and their respective binary matrix representations B P and B Q  the binary matrix of P  Q was

Figure 3 Memory vs support sequential C500A50 with 500 transactions and 50 items This dataset is more dif\002cult than the previous one as the complexity lies in the number of items which determines the number of closed frequent gradual itemsets Figure 4 shows the execution time for both algorithms w.r.t the number of threads with a logarithmic scale for time Figure 5 shows the speedup w.r.t sequential execution for both algorithms Last Figure 6 shows the memory consumption Figure 4 Time vs threads In this experiment with a more complex dataset PGLCM is again two orders of magnitude faster than Grite-MT With all 24 threads PGLCM completes execution near instantly in 1.4s while Grite-MT needs 335s The memory usage does not change much whatever the number of threads for both programs Grite-MT exhibits a better speedup than PGLCM on this experiment However the run times for PGLCM get very low with more than 8 threads they are between 1 and 2 seconds There may not be enough work for PGLCM to exploit all 24 threads We thus did the same experiment with C800A100 a more Figure 5 Speedup Figure 6 Memory vs threads complex dataset with 800 transactions and 100 items GriteMT could not run for this dataset it 002lled up the 64 GB of RAM of our machine and could not complete This excessive memory consumption was already mentioned in and comes from the fact that memory complexity in Grite/GriteMT like in Apriori depends on the number of frequent gradual itemsets to 002nd PGLCM does not have this problem we thus report its run time in Figure 7 the speedup in Figure 8 and the memory consumption in Figure 9 For this more complex problem the run time with 24 cores is 48s so there is enough computation to keep the program busy The speedups are far better in this case with an excellent speedup of 22.15 for 24 threads The granularity of our parallelization is well adapted to complex datasets For further works it could be interesting to be able to decompose the computations in lower granularity tasks when faced with simpler datasets such as C500A50 C Using PGLCM to mine real-world data We have also run experiments on a real dataset of DNA micro-arrays describing gene expressions in the framework

Figure 7 Time vs threads Figure 8 Speedup Figure 9 Memory vs threads of breast cancer The data are described over 4  408 genes which correspond to the items there are 108 transactions This dataset is very complex and up to now no algorithm was able to process it in order to extract gradual patterns We could run PGLCM with 24 threads on this dataset The run times for different support value are presented in Figure 10 Memory consumption remained constant at 17 GB Figure 10 Time vs support 24 threads This dataset is much more complex than the synthetic datasets presented before this time PGLCM needed nearly 16 hours to give results for the lowest support value tested However the important point is that for the 002rst time gradual itemsets could be mined from this gene expression dataset Correlation between expression values of genes is very important to determine gene regulations our algorithms thus opens the way for new methods for analyzing gene expression data and many other numerical datasets V C ONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES We have presented in this paper GLCM the 002rst algorithm for directly mining closed frequent gradual itemsets Such gradual itemsets allow to 002nd covarations between numerical attributes with many applications to real data Our algorithm is based on the ppc-extension idea developed in the LCM algorithm and which is currently the most ef\002cient way to mine closed patterns with a time complexity linear in the number of results to 002nd and a memory complexity constant w.r.t the number of results to 002nd We also parallelized our algorithms in order to exploit the computing power of recent multicore processors Our experimental study have shown that our approach either sequential or parallel is two orders of magnitudes faster than the state of the art Our parallel algorithm scales well with the number of available cores for complex datasets where such computing power is really needed The low memory requirements of our algorithm allow it to handle large real world datasets which could not be

handled by existing algorithms due to memory saturation Our algorithms thus removed the lock that prevented the use of gradual patterns analysis in realistic applications Our work opens several perspectives An immediate perspective is to cooperate with practitioners having large numerical datasets in order to help them extracting and analyzing gradual datasets Reporting the results of such experiments will allow to show the practical interest of gradual pattern and hopefully lead to further research in the 002eld of gradual pattern mining Other perspectives lie in the improvement of our algorithms Currently our algorithm always uses the same binary matrices whatever the gradual itemset under consideration However has sho wn that the binary matrices could be reduced some transactions never appear in the support of a pattern so the corresponding lines and columns can be suppressed from the corresponding binary matrix This optimization would not reduce the theoretical complexity however the FIMI workshop results 22 sho wed that reducing databases was one of the keys for reducing practical run time A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Benjamin N  egrevergne for providing them the Melinda library R EFERENCES  R Agra w al and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules in Proceedings of the 20th VLDB Conference  1994 pp 487–499  J Pei J Han B Mortaza vi-As l H Pinto Q Chen U Dayal and M Hsu Pre\002xspan Mining sequential patterns by pre\002x-projected growth in ICDE  2001 pp 215–224  T  Asai K Abe S Ka w asoe H Arimura H Sakamoto and S Arikawa Ef\002cient substructure discovery from large semistructured data in In Proc of the Second SIAM International Conference on Data Mining SDM2002 Arlington VA  Avril 2002 pp 158–174  A Inokuchi T  W ashio and H Motoda  An apriori-based algorithm for mining frequent substructures from graph data in PKDD  2000 pp 13–23  R Srikant and R Agra w al Mining quantitati v e association rules in large relational tables in SIGMOD Conference  1996 pp 1–12  Y  Aumann and Y  Lindell  A statistical theory for quantitative association rules J Intell Inf Syst  vol 20 no 3 pp 255–283 2003  T  W ashio Y  Mitsunag a and H Motoda Mining quantitative frequent itemsets using adaptive density-based subspace clustering in ICDM  2005 pp 793–796  L Di Jorio A Laurent and M T ei sseire Mining frequent gradual itemsets from large databases in Int Conf on Intelligent Data Analysis IDA'09  2009  N P asquier  Yv es Y  Bastide R T aouil and L Lakhal Ef\002cient mining of association rules using closed itemset lattices Information Systems  vol 24 pp 25–46 1999  B Goethals Fimi repository website  http://\002mi.cs.helsinki.\002 2003-2004  T  Uno M Kiyomi and H Arimura Lcm v er  2 Ef 002cient mining algorithms for frequent/closed/maximal itemsets in FIMI  2004  B Ne gre v er gne A T ermier  J.-F  Mehaut and T  Uno Discovering closed frequent itemsets on multicore Parallelizing computations and optimizing memory accesses in The 2010 International Conference on High Performance Computing  Simulation HPCS 2010  2010 pp 521–528  H Arimura and T  Uno  An output-polynomial time algorithm for mining frequent closed attribute trees in 15th International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming ILP'05  2005  F  Berzal J.-C Cubero D Sanchez M.-A V ila and J M Serrano An alternative approach to discover gradual dependencies Int Journal of Uncertainty Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems IJUFKS  vol 15 no 5 pp 559 570 2007  E H  ullermeier Association rules for expressing gradual dependencies in Proc of the 6th European Conf on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery PKDD'02  Springer-Verlag 2002 pp 200–211  A Laurent B N  egrevergne N Sicard and A Termier Pgpmc Towards a multicore parallel approach for mining gradual patterns in DASFAA 1  2010 pp 78–84  S A youni A Laurent S B Y ahia and P  Poncelet Mining closed gradual patterns in 10th International Conference on Arti\002cial Intelligence and Soft Computing ICAISC 2010  ser LNCS vol 6113 2010 pp 267–274  T  Calders B Goethals and S  Jarosze wicz Mining rankcorrelated sets of numerical attributes in KDD 06 Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data mining  2006 pp 96–105  A Laurent M.-J Lesot and M Rifqi Graank Exploiting rank correlations for extracting gradual dependencies in Proc of FQAS'09  2009  M K endall and B Babi ngton Smith The problem of m rankings The annals of mathematical statistics  vol 10 no 3 pp 275–287 1939  C Lucchese S Orlando and R Pere go P arallel mining of frequent closed patterns Harnessing modern computer architectures in ICDM  2007 pp 242–251  T  Uno T  Asai Y  Uchida and H Arimura  An ef 002cient algorithm for enumerating closed patterns in transaction databases in Discovery Science  2004 pp 16–31  D Gelernter  Multiple tuple spaces in linda  in PARLE 2  1989 pp 20–27

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
