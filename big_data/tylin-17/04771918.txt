An Association Rule Algorithm Based on Quotient Space  Yueqin Zhang, Qingwei Yan, Lili Zong College of Computer and Software Taiyuan University of Technology Taiyuan,China Zhangyq133@163.com,yanqw22468@163.com,zonglili2004@tom.com   Abstract Finding the large item set fast is the crucial step in the association rule algorithm. In this paper we apply granular computing and quotient space to frequent item set discovering by partition the information system to information granule and mapping granule object sets, the algorithm reduced the number of database scanning and reduced object sets required when computing support of candidate item, in this way we improved the efficient of running. For the dataset of small support with high complexity, it is more applicable. The experiment results show: the proposed method is effective Keywords-association rule 002 quotient space 002 granular computing I   I NTRODUCTION  Association rule is one of the most active fields in data mining. The most influential algorithm is Apriori[1  w h ic h  is proposed by Agrawal in 1994, which generates the kcandidate by combining two \(k-1\itemset that have the first k-2 attribute values in the two \(k-1\itemset the same and the last pair does not. A new k-candidate becomes a k-large itemset if every \(k-1\subset of the k-candidate is a large itemset otherwise it is removed. The algorithm need to do table scan of the whole dataset and examine the item sets multiple times, the process is very consuming. To solve the problem of multiple scanning database and too much candidate sets, a lot of algorithm have been improved, such as FP-Growth algorithm [2 D H P  a l g o r i t h m  3 a n d s o  o n   But when deal with mass data, construct FP-tree based on memory is not realistic, and DHP which needs to construct HASH table is consuming too We have proposed that apply granular computing to frequent itemsets discovering before, but the representation of information granule’s data structure is not very perfect. In this paper we not only introduce granular computing and quotient space to frequent itemsets discovering, but also we change the way of representation of information granule Firstly we get information granule from information system the data structure of information granule is compressed binary string and linear list; and then we combine information granule into acquired item sets. In this way the complexity is decreased and efficiency is improved II  B ASIC N OTIONS OF G RANULAR C OMPUTING AND Q UOTIENT S PACE  Granular computing [4  w a s fi r s t pr opo sed b y T Y  Li n  and has become a very important tool in data mining since then.

Yao [8-9 a nd hi s p a r t n e r s  ha ve do ne a l o t o f r e s e ar ch on granular computing and applied it to data mining to solve the problem of association rules There are two basic problems in granular computing: the representation of granule and the computing among the granule. In this paper, by partition information system to acquire information granule, we solved the first problem and by combine information granule in quotient space according to attribute and universe, we complete the second problem A  granular computing An information system [10 i s de fi ned as        S U At C D L Va a At Ia a At 002 003 003 where U is a finite nonempty set of objects At is a finite nonempty set of attributes L is a language defined using attributes in At  Va  is a nonempty set of values for aAt 003 and  I aU Va 004 is an information function.

B  the theory of quotient space Quotient space [11 u s e tr ip le   Xf 006 to describe a problem space or simply a space, where X denotes the universe f indicates the attributes \(or features\ of universe X and 006 is the structure of universe X When view the same universe X from a coarser grain-size, we have a coarse-grained universe denoted by  X and have a new problem space         Xf 006 The coarser universe  X can be defined by a crisp equivalence relation R on X Then the original space   Xf 006 is transformed into a coarser space        Xf 006 called the quotient space of   Xf 006 where  f and   006 are the corresponding quotient attributes and quotient structure of X respectively. And space         Xf 006  can further be transformed into a new space with much coarser resolution by some equivalence relation 2 R  There are two main properties in quotient space structure truth-preserving property and false-preserving property. The former refers to if a proposition is true in the coarser grainsize space, then in certain condition; it is true in the synthetical quotient space to the corresponding problem Suppose we get information from two different coarsegrained spaces  11 1  Xf 006 and  22 2  Xf 006 when we combine these two parts of information into a new one in the combination space  33 3  Xf 006 the truth-preserving property help us reduce computational cost. The properties can be applied to data mining as long as we handle a problem from a fine space to a coarse one. The latter refers to if there is no solution in some area of quotient space, there is no solution in the corresponding area of its original space. When we solve a problem from a coarse-size world to a fine one hierarchically, if we find that some area of the coarse world has no solution, then when we enter the fine world the corresponding area in the world can be omitted for further consideration due to the false preserving property so that the computational cost is reduced From the point of granule, the supersets of frequent item sets can be regarded as coarser grain-size, and subsets of frequent item sets can be regarded as finer grain-size. Then the father-son relationship of frequent pattern can be regarded as partial ordering relation in granular space. So the father-son relationships of frequent pattern in association rules satisfy the truth-preserving property and false preserving property of quotient space. And we can combine subsets into supersets just like we combine coarse-grained spaces into fine-grained spaces. And we can combine into fine-grained spaces from the point of universe, structure and attribute, details please refer to the literature III  F REQUENT I TEMSETS D ISCOVERING A LGORITHM B ASED ON Q UOTIENT S PACE  The basic thought of frequent itemsets discovering algorithm based on quotient space \(quo_Fre\ is that: firstly we divide the information system S to get the basic information granule sets GrS the method is that we partition each attribute according to equivalence relation. And GrS is a quotient space of S For Gr GrS 007\003 it is a describe   av of S  and satisfy min up Gr S 010 minSup is the minimum support Each information granule is a binary string; and for Gr GrS 007\003 we must record the corresponding granule element sets  gs Gr the object sets are stored in a linear list that is, we store the number which is 1 in the binary string in the linear list. Now we get all the required information and we can combine the basic information granule to a new one in universe and attribute in accordance with certain restrictive conditions, until all the frequent item sets is found So quo_Fre algorithm is completed in two steps: the acquisition of basic granule and combination of information granule A  The acquisition of basic granule Input: information system S{U,C D,V,f 002 minSup Output: information granule sets GrS  1  Grs 011 m=|Attr 002 n=|U 002 i =1; //m is the number of attributes, n is the number of records 2  Partition each attribute according to equivalence relation  i U IND Attr and get information granule ij g   ij i g U IND Attr 007\003 belong to the ith attribute and jth equivalence class 3  For ij g 007  ij g  002 i=1, 2…n 002 ij g node data ij g  ij g node next=null 4  For \(i=1 002 i<=n; i++\ the table, initialize ij g  For jk g 007  002 if ji jk Ug 003  ji U belong to jth attribute and ith record  jk g count jk g   1    gnode.data=i; gnode.next=null  jk g node next=gnode 5  For ij g 007 002 If \(gjk.sup>=minSup  ij Grs Grs g 002  After step A, we have information granule sets GrS  which is all the frequent 1-itemsets. But different with traditional 1-itemsets, these 1-itemsets have the information of granule element sets  gs Gr which is stored in the form of linear list, and for any Gr which is a binary string. For example, TABLE 000\003\001\011 is an information table, now we illuminate the process of acquiring information granule sets with step A Firstly we partition each attribute according to equivalence relation, and acquire the quotient set: U/IND outlook\={[sunny  o ver c a s t   ra i n y    U  I N D  w i nd y     f a l se t r u e  U  I N D  p l a y     y e s   no  A m o ng t h e m  s unn y    O1,O2,O6,O7},[overcast  O3  r ain y O 4  O 5 O 8    f a lse   O 1  O 3  O 4 O 5  O 6 O 7  t r u e   O 2  O 8   no  O 3  O 4 O5,O6}, [yes  O 1 O 2 O7  O8  N o w  w e s can th e ta bl e t o  computing the support of each 1-itemsets and on the other hand we must record granule element sets  gs Gr of each granule, the form is binary string, for example, [s corresponding to the binary string 11000110, [false corresponding to 10111110, otherwise, the bit equals 1 in the binary string is put together in a linear list.

Corresponding to new granule [sunny, fals t h e granule element sets is {O1, O6, O7}, and the binary string is 10000110, the linear list is showed in Fig.3 IV  T HE ANALYSIS OF A LGORITHM  quo_Fre algorithm is considered from the following three aspects Firstly, don’t need multiple scan of database. We divide the information system to get the information granule sets Each information granule record the granule element sets in the form of linear list and binary string. So in the process of seek all the frequent item sets, we only need to scan database in preprocessing in step A Secondly, when computing the support of candidate item we don’t need to scan database completely. Suppose the maximal item set is k in a dataset, the cycle number is at least 1 K i i C num  014 000 which num is the record number \(or number of transaction\ and i C is the number of i-itemset When we solve the problem with quo_Fre algorithm, that’s different. For example, for a connecting candidate item 312 lll 013 we only need to consider the universe of one sub item set, so for the same problem above, the cycle number is reduced to 1 K i i C num 015  014\014 000 which  01 015 016\016  Thirdly, when combine \(k-1\-itemset to k-itemset, the two \(k-1\itemset must satisfy certain restrictive conditions that is the first k-2 attribute values the same and the last pair belong to different attribute, in this way ,we reduced the number of candidate item set as soon as possible V  E XPERIMENT AND RESULTS  The tests were conducted using the computer with Pentium4 CPU \(2.41GHz\ 512MB memory, And software is WEKA+eclipse in Windows XP Professional SP2.WEKA is open source software, which is developed by University of Waikato in New Zealand and a lot of algorithm about data mining is contained in it. So we compare Apriori algorithm in WEKA with quo_Fre algorithm, the dataset is five group UCI dataset with arff format, which is list in TABLE 000\003\001\012  TABLE 000\003\001\013 compare the time-consuming of the two algorithms with the same support and TABLE 000\003\001\014 compare the time-consuming of the two algorithms with the different support to the same datasets From the compare results of test we can see that when the dataset is small, quo_Fre algorithm have no predominance too much, because the algorithm need preprocessing to get corelative information to combine into required k-itemset But when the dataset is larger, the time-consuming of quo_Fre algorithm is less; and for the same dataset, the smaller the support, the less time consumed, because required granule object reduced while support become less TABLE II  F IVE GROUP UCI DATASETS WITH ARFF FORMAT  Dataset Rows Column Sobean Kropt Connect4 Adult Ticdata_categ47 683 28056 67557 32561 5822 36 7 6 9 47 TABLE III  C OMPARE RESULTS WITH THE SAME SUPPORT  Dataset Support Apriori\(s\ quo_Fre\(s sobean kropt Connect 546 2806 6757 0.047 2.031 3.531 0.048 0.921 1.923

So how to mining knowledge from mass data is an important problem. The research about granular computing provides new method and ideas to association rules mining. In this paper we introduce information granule and quotient space to the frequent item set discovering procedure, by mapping granule element sets, we reduced the number of database scanning and reduced the number of  cycling while compute support of each candidate.

C  i  that we compute on-the-\037y in our algorithm His structure consists basically of the compressed suf\036x array and a unary coding of the frequency values in the inorder of the virtual suf\036x tree Sadakane shows that the 036nal structure occupies  CSA  2 n  o  n  bits where  CSA  is the size of the compressed suf\036x array used He does not give a space-ef\036cient construction algorithm a suf\036x tree is used as an intermediate stru cture hence taking O  n log n  bits We can construct the required unary coding during our algorithm as follows We maintain the balanced parentheses BP representation as in 32 u s i ng a dynami c b i t v ect or occupying n  o  n  bits This gives us the preorder of the virtual suf\036x tree nodes at each step We use another dynamic bit-vector to store the C counter values in the same unary coding as Sadakane uses Using rank and select  select  i  returns the position of the i th 1 19 on bot h bit-vectors gives us a mapping between BP bit-vector and the C counter bit-vector Inserting a new node in BP means inserting 1 in the corresponding place of the C counter bitvector Incrementing a C counter works by 036nding the corresponding node in BP mapping the position to C counter bit-vector and inserting 0 there Finally after all values are computed the preorder of C counter bit-vector can be turned into the inorder used i n Sadakane’s scheme and the intermediate structures can be deleted The algorithm uses the same space and time as reported in Theorem 1 6 Experimental Results We have implemented the algorithm from  4inC 3 and compared it to the C++-implementation of the optimal algorithm from  3 Our implementation deviates from our theoretical proposal as we use a compressed suf\036x array that is based on sampling  We use a standard sampling rate of log n that minimize the space us age as this is the main objective of our approach However we will also see that a smaller 036xed sampling rate d rastically decreases the execution time while leading only to a moderate increase in space usage We present test results of time and maximum memory usage for different datasets of protein and genome data 6.1 Protein Datasets We used two datasets consisting of the primary structure of all protein data from human and mouse which were obtained from Swissprot using the keywords HUMAN and MOUSE in the NEWT taxonomy browser The human dataset  D 1  contained 71,622 proteins of total length 013 27.3MB and the mouse dataset  D 2  contained 62,562 3 The implementation can be downloaded from http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/suds proteins of total length 013 26.3MB It is interesting to compare these data sets because the genome of human and mouse is known to be largely the same but given the different phenotype of the two species must contain some signi\036cant differences All tests on protein data were run on a 3.0GHz Intel Pentium 4 CPU with 3GB of main memory All output was redirected to the null”-device in order to remove in\037uences from secondary storage units The programs were tested both on mining frequent substrings Probl 1 and emerging substrings Probl 2 The results for the frequent substring mining are reported in Tbl 1 Here the maximum support threshold 006 for D 2 was 036xed to  95  The more striking propert y of the space-ef\036cient algorithm is that it uses only 183.1MB of memory while the optimal algorithm needs 1,267.3MB This means a space reduction of a factor of 013 6  9  As already mentioned in the introduction space is often a more critical resource than time e.g users are often willing to wait 3–4 hours instead of 3 minutes if this allows them to apply their methods to much bigger data sets Table 1 Running time s seconds for mining frequent strings for the optimal   3 and the space-efÞcient   4 algorithm 005 is the minimum support threshold for D 1  The maximum support threshold 006 was held xed at  95  The last column denotes the size of the output 005 optimal space-ef\036cient  output  1 154.4 12,426 3,559 2 151.5 12,403 1,211 3 154.9 12,565 953 4 156.5 12,442 694 5 155.8 12,558 436 6 152.6 13,420 196 7 154.1 12,445 49 8 155.2 12,524 7 9 151.3 12,672 2 avg 154.0 12,606.1  The running times for the emerging substring tasks are reported in Tbl 2 for 005 g 1  3333  and Tbl 3 for 005 g  2  0  The results are largely along the lines of the frequent string mining tasks space is reduced by a factor of 6–7 and the running time is increased by about two orders of magnitude To give an idea on how the dataset length affects computation time and space usage we tested mining frequent substrings from different size pre\036xes of the protein data Tests were run on dataset pre\036xes of total length 2–50MB and on the whole dataset of length 013 53.6MB Here the maxi

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
