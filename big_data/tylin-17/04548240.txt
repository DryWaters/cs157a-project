Very few people have systematically investigated this field. Mining association rules in medical images is an important part in domainspecific application image mining because there are several technical aspects which make this problem challenging. In this paper, we firstly incorporate the domain knowledge into the ROI extraction algorithm and ROI clustering algorithm, then we extend the concept of association rule based on ROI and image in medical images, and propose two algorithms to discover frequent item-sets and mine interesting association rules from medical images. Some interesting results are obtained by our program and we believe many of the problems we come across are likely to appear in other domains  1. Introduction  Mining knowledge from large databases has been the focus of many recent studies and applications. However most of these methods have emphasized corporate data typically in alphanumeric databases. Little research has been conducted on mining image. Advances in image acquisition and storage technology have led to tremendous growth in very large and detailed image databases  A vast am ount of i m age dat a i s generat e d in our daily life and each field, such as medical image CT images, ECT images and MR images etc\satellite images and all kinds of digital photographs. These images involve a great number of useful and implicit information that is difficult for users to discover Image mining can automatically discover these implicit information and patterns from the high volume of images and is rapidly gaining attention in the field of data mining. Image mining is more than just an extension of data mining to image domain. It is an interdisciplinary endeavor that draws upon computer vision, image processing, image retrieval, machine learning, artificial intelligence, database and data mining, etc. While some of individual fields in themselves may be quite matured image mining, to date, is just a growing research focus and is still at an experimental stage. Research in image mining can be broadly classified to two main directions 1\ain-specific applications; \(2\ applications   Dat a  m i ni ng i n m e di cal i m ages bel ongs t o t h e fi rst  direction A few interesting studies and successful applications involving image mining have been reported.

dependent position\her important difference between relational databases and medical image databases is that the implicit spatial information is critical for interpretation of image contents but there is no such requirement in relational databases In this paper, we extend the concept of association rule using object, object-based attribute and relationship predicate, and image-based attribute in medical images To detect objects in medical images, a progressive water immersion algorithm is presented. Then we propose a new method with guidance of domain knowledge to discover frequent item-sets and mine interesting association rules from medical images. Throughout the paper we try to provide a general framework to understand our approach. We believe many of the problems we are facing are likely to appear in other domains. As such this work tries to isolate those problems which we consider will be of most interest to the database community doing research on association rules The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 is pre-processing describing an algorithm to detect objects in medical images. Associa tion rule mining in medical images is presented in section 3. Section 4 briefly reports our performance study. Conclusions are presented in section 5  2. ROI Extraction Algorithm  In this paper, we use domain knowledge effectively to remove the noisy data. A brain CT image mainly consists of three parts: noisy data, skull and cerebrum. The noisy data includes the black background and patient's name etc These information is not only helpless but revealing patient's privacy. We are only interested in cerebrum. So we use domain knowledge \(for short DK1\ng technique of image processing to gain it DK1 --- human's brain skull has the highest density and surrounds the cerebrum   b   d Fig. 1 c\wo original abnormal brain images. Progressive water immersion algorithm is used to mark the objects with dotted line in figure \(b\d \(d That is, the skull is a cricoid area in the image with the whitest pixels that separate cerebrum from the noisy data see figure 1\(a\es easy to remove the noisy data by using cropping technique and keep the interesting region with the guidance of DK1  2.1. ROI Extraction Algorithm  We firstly use progressive water immersion method with guidance of domain knowledge to detect region of interest \(ROI\ medical im ages, then we combine these ROIs with their location, size and other descriptors to form a table for mining First, a N×N window is used to locate the local optimal points in the image For each segmented patches we place the center of the window over each pixel in the patches. If the grey level of the central pixel is optimal with respect to all the other pixels in the window, we say that the central pixel is a local optimum; otherwise, the window will move to be centered at another pixel to continue the search for all lo cal optimal points. At the end of this phase, all the optimum is marked and they will be treated as the starting seeds for water immersion method One advantage of using the sliding window approach is that with the appropriate window size, it is possible to eliminate a large amount of optimal points that correspond to the light and da rk reflection regions thus removing false detection. This is because the grey level of the optimal points corresponding to the light and dark reflection patches are generally lower and higher than that of potential ROI. Given that the distances between the optimal points of the light and dark reflection patches and the nearest optimal points of the neighboring ROI are generally less than that between two touching ROI, it is possible to set the window size in such a way that these false optimal points are ‘absorbed’ by the neighboring ROI optimal points while the true optimal points are not affected Having identified the true optimal points, water immersion process starts from these detected points and progressively floods its neighboring pixels. The neighboring pixels are defined to be the 8-direction neighbors. These neighbors are placed in a growing queue structure sorted in descending order of the grey level of the pixels. The lowest and highest grey pixel in the growing queue will be ‘immersed’ first but respectively and it is marked as belonging to the same region label as the current seed. The marked pixel is then removed from the growing queue. All neighboring pixels whose grey level is lower or higher than the marked pixel are added to the growing queue. This immersion process continues until the growing queue is empty Unfortunately, simple application of the water immersion technique has the tendency of over-flooding

To overcome this problem, we firstly give some definitions Definition 1 We partition all pixels in pixel set P into m blocks. Pixels in the same block have the same grey level and pixels in the differe nt blocks have the different grey level. Let G\(P 1 g 2 g m be P’s grey-scale GS\set if G\(P\ ascending sort set of g 1 g 2  g m and g i is grey level of pixels in the ith block, where g i  i=1,…,m\e ith GS, g 1 and g m are P’s minimum and maximum GS respectively. The GS of pixel p i is denoted as g\(p i  Definition 2 We call gmean\(P\ean GS if  P g mean P 000 g\(p i   i=1 Definition 3 For any P and distance function DisA=|g k g mean P\, mid-value GS is a middle value in the GS set that minimizes DisA. Mid-value GS set is a set of mid-value GS Definition 4 For any P, if 1\Mid-value GS set includes one element g mid and gs is the minimum value between g mean and g mid  2\two elements, g s is the minimum value between these two values g s is called Benchmark GS and another one is denoted as g s  Definition 5 For pixel set P, let g l g i g 1 000d g i  000d g 1 g 1 g s 2} be low bound GS g h  gi g m g m g s 2 000d gi 000d g m be high bound GS g b g l  000 g h be bound GS Our progressive water immersion ignores all those pixels whose grey level doesn’t belong to the bound GS Bound GS is defined with guidance of domain knowledge that describes the degree of dark and light. So the optimality of point in a certain region is defined as follows 000 000 000 set  pixel bound low  tobelongs point  if level,grey  minimal set  pixel boundhigh   tobelongs point  if level,grey  maximal  optimality  2.2. ROI Feature Extraction   Brain midline Fig 2 Normal person’s b rain ima g e For each extracted object R i  we need to extract relevant information for features mining to take place. The domain knowledge of the brain image characteristics indicates that the normal persons have nearly the same brain structure that is evident to be bilateral symmetry. That is, the distribution of density in the left hemisphere of the brain is almost identical with the right, s ee figure 2. The pathological regions result in irregularly shaped grey level distribution in the CT scan images a nd destroy the symmetry, see figure 1.  At this point, the following relevant features are able to provide sufficient discriminative power to cluster objects into different groups: \(1\ level of the object of interest; \(2\f the object of interest; \(3\location of the object of interest; \(4\ongation of the object of interest; \(5\direction of the object of interest; and \(6 symmetry of the object of interest With the above method, the object extracted from brain image is either brightness or darkness. So we define grey level as GL= 0 \(brightness\1 \(darkness\The second feature we have found useful relate to the size of the region in the form of th e area of the region. Area of the region of interest is defined as the total number of pixels within the region, up to and including the boundary pixels. The location of an object of interest is defined as a ratio. The coordinates of the centroid of the object are computed with the formula \(1 000 000 000 k j j x k x 1 1  000 000 000 k j j y k y 1 1 1 k is the number of the pixels of the object and the location is x x y y The fourth feature is the elongation of an object which is defined as the ratio of the width of the minor axis to the length of the major axis. This ratio is computed as the minor axis width distance divided by the major axis length distance, giving a value between 0 and 1. If the ratio is equal to 1, the object is roughly a square or is circular in shaped. As the ratio decreases from 1, the object becomes more elongated. Major axis is the longest line that can be drawn through the object. The two end points of the major axis are found by selecting the pairs of boundary pixels with the maximum distance between them. This maximum distance is also known as the major axis length. Similarly, the minor axis is defined as the line that it is perpendicular with respect to the major axis and the length between the two end points of the line intersected with the object is the longest which is called the width of the minor axis. The ratio, elongation, is a measure of the degree of elongation of an object elongation = len major len minor 2 where len major is the major axis length of the object and len minor is the minor axis length of the object. We establish a common coordinate with brain midline as y and perpendicular line going through the midpoint of midline as x. With the major axis of the object, we define the next feature, direction of the object, as the inclination 000T of the major axis and x positive direction and 000T 000   Before introducing the final feature, we will give some definitions Definition 6 Pixel set of IM p is defined as P={p i p i is the pixel with coordinate \(x i y i the image IM p P\(L and P\(R\ are pixel set of IM p L p R

They are denoted as p li and p ri below  Definition 8  000 g\(P\s IM p s difference set if for any symmetrical pixel p li and p ri  000 g\(P 000 g i  000 g i g\(p li p ri  i=1,2,…,|p|/2 }, where g\(p li p ri  these two pixels respectively Now we define the sixth feature as following Definition 9 An object of interest R pk is symmetrical if for IM p and R p1 R p2 R pk  the mean grey level of 000 g\(R 000 000\020\000 000 k i pi RPPP 1   pk ean 000 g\(R pk ean grey level of 000 g\(P’\ean 000 g\(P’\ the following condition mean 000 g\(R pk ean 000 g\(P 000H  After the above process, all the ROIs are detected and we will call them objects later, see figure 1. Next, images with many different objects are represented by transactions, but there exist relationship among these objects and identical objects \(either bright or dark\can repeat in an image. Therefore we use a table to describe these transactions, see table 1 In table 1, Part I and Part II is image id and object id respectively. Part III is the attribute set of object, for example, grey level, location etc., and Part IV is the re lationship predicate set, for instance, next-to, inside and predicate related to domain Part V is the attribute set of image Table 1  Images are modeled by transactions  3.

Basic Definitions  Definition 10 An association rule in medical images is a rule that associates vi sual object features and the relationship among objects in images, and is of the form 000D 1 P 1  000  000D 2 P 2  000  000š\000D n P n  000  000O 1 P 1 P 2 P n  000  000O 2 P 1  P 2 P n  000  000  000O g P 1 P 2 P n  000o  000E 1 Q 1  000  000E 2 Q 2  000  000  000E m Q m  000  000J 1 Q 1 Q 2 Q m  000  000J 2 Q 1 Q 2 Q m  000  000  000J h Q 1 Q 2 Q m c where c% is the confidence of the rule, one or more P i  i 000  and Q j j 000 1..m or objects but can also be related descriptors of image and object the mean over their histogram etc., and 000D i i 000   and 000E j j 000 1..m are i n t e gers quant i f y i ng t h e occurrence of the object or feature or item 000D n P n is true if and only if P n  has 000D n occurrences 000O i i 000   and 000J j j 000  relationship predicates indicating the relationship of the object or feature or item 000O i P 1 P 2 P n  000J j Q 1  Q 2 Q m always exist and include all items in the bracket Definition 10 leads to the introduction of two notions of support Definition 11 The object-based support of an itemset X in a set of images S denoted by ob_support\(X\is the percentage of objects in all images S. The image-based support of an itemset X in a set of images S denoted by ib_support\(X\s the percentage of images with the same attributes in all images S. The confidence of an association rule X 000o Y is the ratio ib_support\(X 000 Y ib_support\(X\f X or Y includes the attribute of image Otherwise, the confidence is the ratio ob_support\(X 000 Y ob_support\(X Definition 12 An itemset x is sufficiently frequent in a set S if the support of x is no less than its corresponding minimum support threshold 000V and no more than its corresponding maximum support threshold 0006  Definition 13 An association rule X 000o Y in a set of images S is sufficiently strong if X and Y are sufficiently frequent \(X and Y 000  000V  0006  000o Y is greater than 000M  We propose two supports based on object and image because an object maybe appear s repeatedly in an image but image is unique. The different supports mean different counting a nd different interestingness. We will give an example to describe this difference in next subsection   3.2. Frequent Item-sets Mining Algorithm  The reader is asked to read this subsection carefully as it provides the motivation for the algorithm we will describe later. Several medically important association rules are discussed as well as rules which are not interesting. Here we summarize the main difficulties we have isolated so far trying to discover frequent item-sets in the medical images Association size. Associations and rules that involve many items are hard to interpret and can potentially generate a very high number of rules.

slow down the interactive pro cess by the user. Therefore there should be a default threshold for association size The biggest size of found associations is a practical bottleneck for algorithm performance. If for a given support the k-itemset X is frequent then all Y 000z\000 and Y 000 X are frequent and then there are O\(2 k sets included. It is easy to see that no matter how efficient the algorithm is, the approach above will be slow for a large k Associations having uninteresting combinations of Items. This is the case where certain combinations are known to be trivial or have such a high support that does not really tell something new about the data set. Consider items x i and x j if the association X 1 x i x j is not interesting then any other association X 2 000 X 1 will not be interesting. Therefore, many of the items can be grouped by the domain expert to discard uninteresting associations We assume small groups can be identified by domain knowledge With all the above problems, we propose the following algorithm. We introduce a function group\(\which comes from domain knowledge, to constraint the number of frequent item-sets to be discovered. Let C k O 1 O 2  O k be a set of items to be mined. We define group\(O i  be an integer t if the item O i belongs to a group. The constraint for discovering frequent item-sets was set as follows. Since the brain is composed of the left and right hemisphere, we set group\(O i 0 if the object O i is only in the left hemisphere, 1 if the object O i is only in the right, and 2 if the object O i bestrides both brain hemispheres. Let imax be the maximum number of items appearing in one rule Algorithm 1 \(SFIMI Find sufficient frequent itemsets based on two supports in medical images Input i 1 a set of transactions without relationship predicate; \(ii\aximum and minimum object-based support and image-based support thresholds max_ob min_ob, max_ib and min_ib Output Sufficiently frequent item-sets  1  C 1  000m candidate 1 item-set 2  F 1  000m frequent 1 item-set from C 1  3  k = 2 4  while \( k 000d  max  5  Extend F k-1 by one item belonging to any F k-1  let C k O 1 O 2 O k  if \(group\(O i  000z group\(O j  000z j and 1 000d i, j 000d k then C k is a candidate 6  Check support of all candidate C k making one pass over the transactions let X be item-sets only containing items about objects let Y be item-sets containing items about images F k  000m c 000 C k c 000 X 000 ob_support\(c 000t min_ob  000 c 000 Y 000 ib_support\(Y 000t min_ib 7  k=k+1 8   9  Result 000m\000 k c 000 F k k>1 000 c 000 X 000 ob_support\(c 000d max_ob 000 c 000 Y 000 ib_support\(Y 000d max_ib  Line 1-3 are done in the same initial scan.

Association Rules Generating Algorithm  Most papers published in the database literature concentrate on optimizing the above phase, but few to improve rule generation. For mining association rule in medical images, there ex ist the following problem Items can appear only in th e antecedent, only in the consequent or in either. Note that given the interesting rule X 000o Y no matter where an item appears the association X 000 Y must be a frequent itemset, but where the item appears prunes out many uninteresting rules. In other words, support is still needed to prune uninteresting associations but confidence is not enough to prune out uninteresting rules because there may be many rules having high confidence containing forbidden items in the antecedent or in the conseque nt. Therefore items need to be constrained to appear in a specific part of the rule With this requirement, we propose the following algorithm. Let F 1 F 2 F M be all frequent item-sets obtained in the above algorithm \(SFIMI\e propose a constraint function cons\(\ eliminate the rules to be mined. We define cons\(f i be 1 if the item f i can appear either in the anteced ent or in the consequent, and 2 if it can appear only in the consequent of the rule Algorithm 2 \(GAR Generate association rules from the sufficient frequent item-sets Input i\-sets F 1 F 2 F M  ii\ minimum confidence Output Association rules  1  for m=1 to M 2  for all non-empty subsets of F m

Experiments  The goal of the following experiment was to relate CT to brain tumor to validate actual diagnosis rules used by medical experts. In this case the purpose was mainly to confirm the validity of medical knowledge and tried to find new rules The dataset utilized in our experiments was real data from hospital. The main reason why we study on real brain CT images instead of any simulative data is to avoid insignificance and uninterestingness and the reliability of the discovered knowledge. To ha ve access to real medical images is a very difficult undertaking due to legally privacy issues and management of hospital. But with some specialists' help and support, we got 618 precious images and their corresponding diagnosis records which for simplicity, we generalized to normal\(N\d abnormal\(A The following is the constraint for generating association rules. For the descriptions of the images, like diagnosis record, they were constrained to appear in the consequent of the rule, that is, cons\(i\because it is more significant not only to medical doctors but patients Objects with their attributes were constrained to appear concurrently either in the an tecedent or in the consequent i.e. cons\(i tly unmeaningful that an object is in the consequent and its a ttribute is in the antecedent We ran experiments with both of two max support 100% and association rule size imax 6. We varied minimum confidence and minimum support of objectbased and image-based to get rules. The program can’t be run without constraining and maybe the excessive rules will be generated. Table 2 shows our experiment results  Table 2  Experiment results with medical images Min_ob Min_conf_o object-based Min_ib Min_conf_i image-based the number of the rules 0.3 0.6 0.2 0.6 103 0.4 0.5 0.3 0.5 72 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.4 13  When the minimum support was lower, many of these rules were not interesting. But when it was higher, most of them were interesting and even important. We will show two rules that validate the actual diagnosis and domain knowledge Rule 1: 2O 1 000 2O 2 000 symmetry\(O 1 O 1  000 symmetry\(O 2 O 2  000o   Rule 2: 1O 1 000 1O 2 000 homolateral\(O 1 O 2  000o 2O 1 000 homolateral\(O 1 O 1  000    O 1 and O 2 in rule 1 and rule 2 are light region and dark region respectively. The integer is the number of the objects repetition. Relationship predicate symmetry represents that two objects are symmetrical and homolateral two objects are concurrently in the left or right hemisphere.

Rule 2 describes that if there are one light region and one dark region in one side of the brain image, then there are two dark regions in another side of the brain image and this image belongs to an abnormal person iminate many rules like 2O 1  000o 1O 2 where O 1 and O 2 are in the same side.

medical domain knowledge to direct the algorithms to decrease the number of candidate k item-sets to a large extent   5. Conclusion  In this paper, we have extended the concept of association rule using object, object-based attribute and relationship predicate, and image-based attribute in medical images. Two different supports based on object and image mean different counting and different interestingness. To detect objects in medical images, we have presented a progressive water immersion algorithm with guidance of domain knowledge to preprocessing the medical image set. Then we proposed two new algorithms with guidance of domain knowledge to discover frequent item-sets and mine interesting association rules from medical images. We have described the problem with a general form to provide a common framework for other problems appeared in other domains. Some interesting results were obtained by our program and solved the excessive uninteresting rules to some extent  References   U. M. Fay y a d, S G Djor govski, and N. Weir.

hour after the min_sup becomes smaller than 0.4. However the MPFCI algorithm can find all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets efficiently. This explains that the computational cost of directly testing frequent closed probability increases sharply with the increase of the number of probabilistic frequent itemsets \(The number increases w.r.t the increase of min_sup\milar results can be found in Fig. 5\(b\which also reports comparison of running time in T20I10D30KP40 dataset. Hence, it is inefficien t to directly check frequent closed probabilities of all probabilistic frequent itemsets which can be obtain by existing solution, such as TODIS [22  Next, we focus on the test of effectiveness of different pruning strategies Effect of min_sup in MPFCI We firstly investigated the running time of five compared algorithms w.r.t. the minimum support, min_sup. Fig. 6\(a\ shows the running time of all algorithms while min_sup changes from 0.2 to 0.6 in Mushroom dataset. When min_sup decreases, we observe that the running time of all the algorithms goes up due to the number of probabilistic frequent itemsets increases. However we find that the growth speed of MPFCI is the lowest due to all pruning methods it employed. We also find that MPFCINoCH has the similar running time with that of MPFCI. This indicates that the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound pruning contributes less to reduce the total running time compared to other pruning methods. In addition, MPFCI-NoBound is the slowest algorithm. In particular the running time of MPFCINoBound is larger than 1 hour when min_sup is smaller 0.3 Similar results can be found in Fig. 6\(b\hich reports the running time of all algorithms in T20I10D30KP40  dataset Effect of pfct in MPFCI We continue to test the running time of five compared algorithms with varying the probabilistic frequent closed threshold, pfct in two different b\, we can obverse that MPFCI is always the fastest algorithm. With regards to the change of pfct, the running time of all algorithms remains approximately the same. Thus, in tuple-model uncertain transaction database we can discover that the influence of probabilistic frequent closed threshold will be smaller than that of min_sup to the total running time. Meanwhile, MPFCI is the fastest algorithm and MPFCI-NoBound is still the slowest one, which indicates that the probabilistic bound pruning is more effective than other pruning methods  a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 5 Efficiency Comparison between MPFCI and Naïve  a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 6 Running time w.r.t min_sup    a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 7 Running time w.r.t pfct   a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 8 Running time w.r.t 0010   a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 9 Running time w.r.t 001  Effect of 000H 000H in MPFCI In this part, we mainly analyse the influence of the relative tolerance error  0010 to the running time in Fig. 8 \(a\\(b\ With the change of 0010 we can observe: 1 four algorithms, MPFCI, MPFCI-NoCH, MPFCI-NoSuper and MPFCI-NoSub, keep a steady running time. 2\e algorithm of MPFCI-NoBound becomes slower clearly when 0010  becomes lower. In addition, the above observations also verify the time complexity analysis of the approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability. Because the MPFCI-NoBound algorithm does not use any probabilistic bound pruning to reduce redundant computation for frequent closed probability, we have to compute closed probabilities of all itemsets which cannot be removed by other pruning methods.  Please note that the time complexity of our approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability is 2 4 ln\(2       Ok UTD 000G\000H Moreover, the running time of approximation algorithm will increase 2 1   O 000H with the decreasing of 0010 Thus, the decreasing of 000H causes more influence to the running time of the MPFCI-NoBound

algorithm. Moreover, other four algorithms utilize the probabilistic bounds pruning, so they can avoid redundant computation of frequent closed probabilities Effect of 000G 000G in MPFCI We finally studied the influence of running time from the probabilistic confidence degree parameter 000G in  Fig. 9 \(a\d \(b\We can find the similar effect with the change of 000H Namely, the MPFCI-NoBound algorithm is also affected greatly by the change of 000G By comparing the results in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we can discover that the influence of 000G on the running time of MPFCINoBound is smaller than the influence of 000H This is because with decreasing of 000G the running time of MPFCI-NoBound about computing frequent closed probability will increase ln\(2   O 000G   B  Compression Quality Evaluation In this subsection, we mainly evaluate the compression quality of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in probabilistic data against that of frequent closed itemsets in exact data. Without loss of gene rality, we test the compression quality under two different di stributions over Mushroom dataset. The first one makes the Mushroom follows Gaussian distribution whose mean is 0.8 and variance is 0.1. The second one follows Gaussian distribu tion whose mean is 0.5 and variance is 0.25 \(Namely, the default set of the Mushroom dataset in our experiments\n addition, we keep same default values of pfct=0.8 000H 0.1, and 000G 0.1 as used in the last subsection We compare the number of itemsets of frequent itemsets for short FI\, frequent closed itemsets \(for short FCI probabilistic frequent itemsets \(for short PFI\, and probabilistic frequent closed itemsets \(for short PFCI\he first two kinds of itemsets are produced by FP-growth algorithm orithm 24] f r o m th e exa ct Mushroom dataset. The PFI and PFCI are generated by TODIS algorithm r alg orithm respecti v e l y   Fig. 10 \(a\hows the comparison of the number of above four kinds of itemsets under the uncertain Mushroom dataset whose mean is 0.8 and variance is 0.1. With min_sup decreasing from 0.3 to 0.1, we observe that the ratio between Number of FCI and Number of FI declines sharply Meanwhile, the ratio between Number of PFCI and Number of PFI also declines quickly. That means the probabilistic frequent closed itemsets over uncertain data have the similar compression effect with frequent closed itemsets in exact data Fig. 10 \(b\ also shows the similar compression result However, we also observe that the compression effect of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in Fig. 10 \(b\is worse than that in Fig. 10 \(a\hat is because Fig. 10 \(b\he smaller mean than Fig. 10 \(a\as the higher variance than Fig. 10 \(a\ The smaller mean and higher variance indicate higher uncertainty, which leads to less number of probabilistic frequent itemsets and probabilistic frequent closed itemsets under same threshold To sum up, above results demonstrate that our definition of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets keeps the good compression property of frequent closed itemsets in exact data  a  Mean  0.8,  Var=0.1                     \(b  Mean  0.5,  Var=0.25 Fig. 10 Compression Quality  w.r.t min_sup  C  Approximation Quality Evaluation In this subsection, we evaluate the approximation quality of our mining algorithm since the problem of computing frequent closed probability has been proven as a #P-Hard problem Because approximation effect of our algorithm is determined by the relative tolerance error 0010 and the probabilistic confidence degree parameter  001 we mainly focus on testing the change of the result set w.r.t the change of 0010 and 001 over our default uncertain Mushroom dataset. We denote the set of the final result as FR and the set of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets as TI. We use precision which equals FR TI FR and recall which equals FR TI TI to measure the approximate effect. Moreover, it is hard to get the set of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets due to #P-hard complexity. Thus, we use the result set when 0010 0.01 and 001 0.01 as true result set Fig. 11 \(a\ows that the change of precision and recall when 0010 increases from 0.05 to 0.3 and 001 equals 0.1. We observe that the recall keeps s teady, but precision decreases with 0010 increasing. Because the number of sampling in the ApproxFCP algorithm equals 2 42 ln n 000H\000G  the number of sampling will decrease significantly with 0010 increasing. Moreover 001  equals 0.1, probabilistic confidence degree is also fixed. Thus the number of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets keeps steady and recall also remain stable. Similarly, Fig. 11 \(b shows the case where 001 increases from 0.05 to 0.3 and 0010  equals 0.1. Because 001 only influences the number of sampling on ln 2  000G times, recall is affected slightly and precision also remains stable. To sum up, above results demonstrate that our approximation algorithm has a good approximation quality  a  Varying 0010 b  Varying 001  Fig. 11 Approximation Quality in Mushroom  D  Algorithm Framework Evaluation In this subsection, we evaluate the efficiencies of the depthfirst search-based and breadth-fi rst search-based strategies Fig. 12\(a\hows the running time of two search solutions while min_sup varies from 0.2 to 0.6 and other parameters are

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
