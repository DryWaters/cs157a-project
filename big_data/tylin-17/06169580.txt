gpuDCI Exploiting GPUs in Frequent Itemset Mining Claudio Silvestri Salvatore Orlando Universit  a Ca Foscari Venezia silvestri@unive.it,orlando@unive.it Abstract Frequent itemset mining FIM algorithms extract subsets of items that occurs frequently in a collection of sets FIM is a key analysis in several data mining applications and the FIM tools are among the most computationally intensive data mining ones In this work we present a many-core parallel version of a 
state-of-the-art FIM algorithm DCI  whose sequential version resulted for most of the tested datasets better than FP-Growth one of the most efìcient algorithms for FIM We propose a couple of parallelization strategies for Graphics Processing Units GPU suitable for different resource availability and we present the results of several experiments conducted on real-world and synthetic datasets 1 Introduction Frequent Itemset Mining FIM is one of the main and most demanding task in the data mining DM eld As an example of FIM analysis consider a database where the 
data records are shop sales transactions  each composed of distinct bought items  The goal is to nd the sets of items  itemsets  that are bought together in not less than a given number of transactions namely the minimum support  FIM is not only an interesting problem by itself and a crucial part of Association Rules Mining ARM b ut it also has a key role in the solution of several other DM problems For this reason even two decades after this problem was rst 
introduced it is still an acti v e research topic Han et al in pro vide a comprehensi v e surv e y of the state of the art in FIM and devise future research directions The challenges in FIM derive from the large size of its search space which in the worst case corresponds to the power set of the set of items and thus is exponential in the number of distinct items Restricting as much as possible this space and efìciently performing computations on it are key issues for FIM algorithms However when the number of transactions/items are huge or the minimum support is very small analysts who need to quickly explore a 
large dataset through a FIM tool ask for new techniques to improve algorithm performance by taking advantage of the evolutions in distributed computing systems and parallel computing Indeed since FIM introduction several works proposed distributed and parallel methods to deal with larger scale problems A classical survey on parallel and distributed association-rule-mining algorithms was presented by Zaki a decade ago in In the last years two factors stimulated a renewed interest respectively in distributed and parallel methods for data mining and in particular for high performance FIM 
methods The rst is the wide availability of commercial large-scale distributed computing facilities such as the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud the second is the increasing number of cores available in microprocessors for example the recent NVIDIA GF110 microprocessor the one used in Tesla M2090 and GeForce GTX 580 cards features 512 core and the SPARC T3 microprocessor sports 16 CPU cores with 8 hardware threads per core These innovations open new scalability opportunities on the one hand and demand for additional care to handle their peculiarities on the other Thus to effectively exploit these 
opportunities there is a need for a new generation of data mining algorithms in particular able to exploit the GeneralPurpose computing paradigm on Graphics Processing Units GP-GPU http://gpgpu.org  This is due to the radically different architecture design and programming model of GPUs many-core with respect to traditional multi-core and multi-processor platforms In the case of FIM the optimizations that are conceived with multi-core CPU in mind and for a speciìc memory hierarchy such as the ones described in w ould be of little help in a completely different memory hierarchy and 
processor architecture For example the CUDA framework allows for and in some cases forces to use explicit movements of data between slower and faster memories and at the same time organizing threads in a hierarchy posing strong constraints on the order in which data are accessed by concurrent threads Whenever these constraint are not satisìed partial serialization of the execution is forced causing a large part of cores to remain idle In these conditions it

is not uncommon to observe a GPU processor occupancy falling below 10 the actual fraction depends on the device in use thus obtaining a slowdown in the execution of the parallel algorithm In this work we present the GP-GPU version of a stateof-the-art FIM algorithm DCI 15 whose sequential version resulted orders of magnitude better than the wellknown Apriori In addition for most of the tested datasets DCI resulted also better than FP-Growth a famous divide&conquer FIM algorithm While the parallelization of Apriori has been deeply studied the ef fective parallelization of other more efìcient algorithms that use dynamic data structures results much harder Since DCI uses simple static data structures and permits a lot of data parallelism involving bitwise operations to be exploited it could be a good candidate for a GPU porting However many issues remain to be investigated mainly concerning i the parallelizing strategies to adopt ii the data access patterns and iii the careful management of the GPU memory hierarchy In this paper we focus on a pair of parallelization strategies The former uses a simple map-reduce paradigm to realize in parallel collective logical operations between bitmaps with a nal bitcount we call this technique transaction-wise  since each bitmap records the presence/absence of a given item in all the transactions of the dataset The latter adopts a nested data-parallelism where blocks of candidate itemsets are assigned to distinct GPUês multiprocessors for computing their supports number of occurrence of each candidate itemset in the dataset transactions where each GPUês multiprocessor in turn adopts a map-reduce paradigm like in the previous approach We call this strategy candidate-wise  and its exploitation affects a crucial feature of DCI  the management of the special cache used to store intermediate results and save work We conducted several experiments on realworld and synthetic datasets The GPU porting of DCI gives clear performance advantages over the CPU-based one and the candidate-wise strategy unquestionably wins over the transaction-wise approach for most of the tested datasets due to the better multiprocessor occupancy The rest of the paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we describe the CUDA framework for GP-GPU and the DCI algorithm In Section 3 we analyze the opportunities for parallelization in DCI and describe the implementation of two different strategies Then in Section 4 we assess the performances of the proposed methods Finally in Section 5 we survey some relevant related work and in Section 6 we describe some possible extension of the proposed approaches 2 Background In this section we give an overview of two topics that are particular important to better understand the following parts of the paper Speciìcally the essentials of the CUDA framework for General Purpose GPU computing GPGPU which is used by the algorithm proposed in this paper and a description of the DCI algorithm for Frequent Itemset Mining which is the sequential algorithm that inspired our parallel algorithm 2.1 GPGPU the CUDA framework The core of the CUDA parallel kit are three abstractions a hierarchy of thread groups shared memories and barrier synchronization These abstractions provide a mix of data parallelism and task parallelism at different granularities Typically a problem is split into independent subproblems that are mapped to blocks of threads Each subproblem is split again and the atomic pieces are assigned to individual threads of the same block that cooperate to solve the sub-problem A GPU usually is composed of several multiprocessors sharing a common device memory also called global memory Each multiprocessor consists of several cores 8-32-48 depending on device kind and a shared memory Thread blocks are granted to be mapped to a speciìc multiprocessors thus the threads in the same block can cooperate by sharing data in the same fast memory and synchronize by means of barriers On the other hand there is no kind of warranty on the multiprocessor assignement of different blocks or on their order of execution Each block is further divided in several warps that are groups of threads always scheduled at the same time and at the same program address 2.2 The DCI algorithm DCI is a multi-strategy algorithm for Frequent Itemset Mining FIM characterized by several phases each exploiting a different strategy The key idea common to several other FIM algorithms is to exploit the apriori principle all the subsets of a frequent set must be frequent Thus the algorithm performs several iterations starting with on item patterns and increasing the size of searched pattern at each iteration During the rst phase DCI adopt an Apriori-like strategy by scanning the database by transaction using speciìc direct-count data structure to update the counters of the itemsets and operating a strong pruning of the on-disk dataset This initial phase is named Direct Count  DC  which is the rst part of the DCI acronym

After the DC phase when the number of surviving transactions and items does allow the vertical representation of the pruned dataset in memory DCI switches to the Intersection phase where I is the last part of the DCI acronym In the vertical representation for each item we have a Tidset  which is composed of the identiìers of all the transactions including the item itself Indeed DCI uses a bitwise data structure each retained frequent item is associated with a bitmap  where the bit in the n th position is equal to 1 iif the n th transaction contains the item The algorithm still processes candidates of increasing length but now the support of a candidate can be immediately computed by a bitwise logical And operation on the bitmaps associated with the single items contained in the pattern followed by a count of the bits set to 1 in the resulting bitmap mapreduce The adoption in DCI of a suitable data structure for the management of the frequent patterns featuring an iteration by common preìx in lexicographical order gives two substantial beneìts an easy and efìcient way to generate candidates already in lexicographical order and thus ready to be stored in case they are frequent by merging frequent patterns that share a common preìx and a substantial item overlap between consecutive candidates This last fact allows for the reuse of of intermediate results during the computation of bitwise ands For example when computing the support of the following four candidate itemsets  2  4  7  80    2  4  7  81    2  4  7  82   and  2  4  82  90   where each item is represented as an integer a straightforward approach would need 3  4=12 bitmap intersections 3 bitmap intersections for each 4-itemset whereas by caching and reusing the intermediate results just 3+1+1+2  7 are enough Indeed only the rst candidate requires the intersection of all of the bitmaps whereas the following ones have preìx overlaps with the preceding candidates and require a number of intersection which is equal to the number of different items 3 FIM on GPUs the gpuDCI algorithm In this section we will describe gpuDCI  a parallel algorithm inspired by DCI that exploits GPUs to efìciently mine frequent itemsets from transactional datasets Before discussing in depth the implementation details in Section 3.5 we rst address the opportunities for parallelization that the different phases of the DCI algorithm present and the parallelization strategies that are behind the two versions of the proposed algorithm 3.1 GPU Parallelization opportunities As we previously highlighted DCI is a multi-strategy algorithm characterized by a Direct Count phase and an Intersection phase According to our tests the Direct Count phase accounts for a limited part of the running time of the algorithm at least in the most computational intensive cases Indeed even if the later described Intersection phase is more efìcient than the Direct Count phase usually it has to deal with a much higher number of candidates and frequent patterns due to combinatorial explosion and thus account for the most signiìcant part of the overall running time 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 0 50 100 150 200 250 x1000 x1000 Pattern length Number of frequent patterns Accidents ms=50k T40 ms=500  Figure 1 Number of frequent patterns for different pattern length In support of this intuition the reader can nd in Figure 1 an example of the relation between the number of frequent patterns and their length for two different dataset see the experimental result section for a description of the datasets On the other hand the peculiarities of the count phase would hinder the efìcient exploitation of GPUs during this phase To ensure an high efìciency the GPU cores in the same GPU multiprocessor has to execute the very same code on data characterized by high spatial locality and accessed according to quite strict memory access pattern This is hardly the case with a large number of counters Moreover if the number of counters is limited for example during the item count phase for some problem setting the running time is usually I/O bound and transfering the still unpruned dataset to the GPU memory could entail even worst performances The intersection phase instead accounts for a signiìcant part of the running time and the computation of the single intersection and set bits count operations require non trivial computational resources Further both bitmap intersection and count can be reasonably distributed among the cores of the same GPU and the bitmaps can be accessed in sequential strides which is optimal to maximize GPU memory bandwidth Moving the candidate generation to GPU could give some advantage However according to our proìling tests the candidate generation contribution to the overall running time is just a small fraction of the time due to bitmap intersection and count Further performing candidate gener

ation in GPU would decrease the GPU memory available for bitmap intersection and count due to the need to maintain frequent patterns of the current and previous iteration in GPU memory possibly with negative effects on overall performances For these reasons we have decided to focus our parallelization effort on the computation of candidate supports during the Intersection phase 3.2 An overview of gpuDCI The basic idea behind gpuDCI is to start computation on CPU as in DCI  and move the pruned dataset to the GPU as soon as the bitwise vertical dataset ts into the GPU global memory Afterward the support computation will be delegated to the GPU However after switching to GPU the CPU still manages patterns generates candidates and store patterns that are frequent according to the support computed by the GPU Also the cache used by DCI to store and reuse intermediate intersection results is moved to the GPU Since the cache is only needed for support computation and the CPU needs to know just the support of each pattern this approach will limit the data transfer between system and GPU memories There are several conditions that have to be satisìed to ensure optimal GPU usage Among them three particularly important ones are related to processor utilization blocking operations and memory access patterns The rst is quite obvious but not always easy to obtain not only we have to provide enough workload for each core but also to ensure that every core has the resources needed to execute the assigned computation The second goal is to minimize the number of synchronizations in particular operations causing global synchronization such as kernel launches and memory transfers and other blocking operations Finally the last one subsumes several possible memory access optimizations One of the most important is to ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning memory accesses to avoid serializations In the following subsection we will describe two strategies that resulted suitable thus producing good speedups for different kinds of datasets 3.3 Transaction-wise parallelization In this approach all the GPU cores independently of the GPU multiprocessor they belong to work on the same intersection or count operation Each thread is in charge of an interleaved portion of the bitmap in such a way that threads having consecutive indexes work on consecutive parts of the bitmap see Figure 2 left Note that our bitmaps are actually vectors of integers 32 or 64 bit depending on the architecture The contiguous blocks of 32-64 bits processed    a Intersection b Count Figure 2 Transaction-wise parallelization by the same thread are thus separated by a xed stride of blocks  threads  where blocks and threads are respectively the number of thread blocks and thread per blocks decided at kernel launch time In the case of intersection bitwise and this access pattern applies both to reading the bitmaps and writing the result of the operation In the case of counting  popcount  this only applies to fetching the bitmaps from global memory since the result is a single number In both cases the global memory accesses to bitmaps are coalesced The threads that are involved in the operations on a bitmap are not in the same multiprocessor and thus do not have access to the same fast shared memory For this reason the reduction of the count of bits set to 1 sum of the partial sums computed by each thread has to be computed in two steps after each thread has termined the count on its part of the bitmap the counter of each thread is summed on a per multiprocessor base local reduction and then the partial sum for each multiprocessor are added to obtain the nal result global reduction Both reduction are per

formed by using a pair-wise tree based approach make use of the fast shared memory that is present on each multiprocessor see Figure 2 right The key difference however is that local reduction starts with data already stored in the shared memory whereas in the global reduction the multiprocessor that is in charge for the reduction must fetch the counters that are relative to other multiprocessors from the GPU global memory To ensure that all cores are involved in the computation the number of thread blocks must be at least equal to the number of GPU multiprocessors Further to ensure that the cores of each multiprocessor are active global memory access should be overlapped with computation On NVIDIA devices this usually happens when there are at least 200300 threads per block 600-1200 for devices with computing capability 2.1 If we consider a top range NVIDIA device having computing capabilities 2.x GTX580 16 MP 512 cores this method can successfully hides the global memory latency when there are at least 16  1200  64  1228800 transactions in the pruned dataset Due to the efìciency of the dataset pruning in DCI  quite often the intersection phase involves a signiìcantly smaller number of transactions In such a setting we can chose either to pay the latency for the global memory access due to an insufìcient number of threads per block or to leave some multiprocessor idle due to an insufìcient number of blocks The amount of GPU memory required by this strategy is mainly determined by the size of the pruned dataset   items  size  bitmap   plus the size of the intermediate result cache  max pattern length  size  bitmap   In case there is room for more than one cache we can devise a different parallelization strategy discussed in the next section which entails a higher utilization of the cores even when bitmaps that are not huge 3.4 Candidate-wise parallelization In this approach each GPU multiprocessor works on the intersection and count operations related to a different candidate whereas the cores of the same multiprocessor work on the same intersection or count operation exactly as in the previous approach At an abstract level thread blocks are in charge of a block of candidates that are processed one by one threads are in charge of the intersection or count on an interleaved portion of a bitmap Note that in this case the threads that are involved in the operations on a bitmap are all in the same multiprocessor and have access to the same fast shared memory The main issue to be tackled to implement this strategy is the management of the cache used to save intermediate intersection results One of the advantages of the caching method adopted by DCI is its really simple policy Candidates are examined in lexicographi      a Intersection b Count Figure 3 Candidate-wise parallelization cal order thus we just need a stack of intermediate results When a new candidate is examined the results that are no longer needed are popped out of the stack that is we retain the intermediate results corresponding to the common preìx of the current and last examined candidates Processing more than one candidate in parallel inevitably contrasts this simplicity The solution is to assign collections of candidates to the same thread blocks and thus multiprocessor by setting an independent cache per each block Further to increase the chance of cache reuse given the sequence of all lexicographically ordered candidates we assign a contiguous sub-sequence of candidates to each thread block see Figure 3 The amount of GPU memory required is larger than the one required by the previous strategy Indeed in this case the size of the intermediate result cache is multiplied by the number of thread blocks used  thread blocks  max pattern length  size  bitmap   3.5 Implementation In this section we describe the implementation of the two parallelization of the DCI algorithm introduced in the previous section We will rst describe how operations are struc

tured in batches then the building blocks that are common to the two approach and nally how they are combined to obtain the nal results 3.5.1 Batches of operations Operations on GPU that require memory transfer and kernel launches incur in xed costs that can be amortized over multiple operations A typical computation pattern is move the relevant data to the GPU invoke the kernel move the result from the GPU to the CPU However for read-only data shared among many operations it is better to move a large block of memory at once For these reasons we move the full dataset to the GPU global memory before computation execute support count operations in batches and fetch blocks of results at the end of the batch For efìciency reasons what is actually passed to the GPU by the CPU is not a set of candidates but instead a sequence of operation involving the dataset and the intermediate result cache Such operations could be intersection of two bitmap or intersection and set bit count of two bitmap either associated to items or to intermediate results For example the computation of the support of itemset  213  345  400  followed by the computation of the support of itemset  213  345  430  will be transformed into the sequence of commands where  is the bitwise logical And  store in  the result of     store in  the number of bits set to 1 in   bitmap[400  store in  the number of bits set to 1 in   bitmap[430 Note the reuse of the cache entry  to compute the itemset count of  213  345  430   In transaction-wise parallelization all the threads execute the same operation at the same time and that each operation is speciìed by a few parameters In our tests we veriìed that the kernel launch overhead is negligible wrt the cost of the intersection and count over a large bitmap Further one global synchronization is needed after each count operation Thus we decided to execute the different operations contained in a batch using one kernel launch for each The parameters of the operations are speciìed by kernel parameters and results are fetched in block at the end of the batch In candidate-wise parallelism there is a relevant difference the threads belonging to distinct blocks are involved in different operations hence there is an increased number of parameters to be speciìed To cope with this issue we decided to store the parameters of all the operations of a batch in a command buffer data structure which is moved Transaction-wise i  blockIdx  threadsPerBlock  threadIdx while i  bitmapSize   bmp1[i  bmp2[i i=i threadsPerBlock  numBlocks Candidate-wise i  threadIdx while i  bitmapSize   bmp1[i  bmp2[i i=i threadsPerBlock Figure 4 Intersection kernel executed by each thread to the GPU constant memory when the processing of the batch starts and is then repeatedly accessed by the kernel to determine the next operation to be performed It is worth remarking that the constant memory is cached thus accesses to the same location by several threads  e.g all the threads working on the same operation  are particularly efìcient The batch is executed in several step and in each step all the blocks are expected to execute one basic operation intersection or intersection and count In an effort to maximize constant cache hits we stored in close command buffer positions the parameters of the operations that are expected to be executed in the same step Since each multiprocessor has its own constant cache this approach gives beneìts only when the kernel is launched with a number of thread blocks larger than the number of GPU multiprocessors e.g to hide latencies when the number of transactions is small 3.5.2 Building blocks basic operations on GPU The pseudocode in Figure 4 describes the intersection operations i.e the most frequent one in DCI  carrier by the GPU threads We highlight that the main difference between the implementations in the two approaches is the stride in the Transaction-wise parallelization case it is determined by the block index and the thread index whereas in the candidatewise parallelization case it is determined only by the thread index since different thread blocks are operating on different bitmaps and bmp1  bmp2  and out refer to different GPU memory zones It is worth recalling that such bitmaps are actually stored as vectors of int 32 or 64 bit depending on the architecture and thus the  operations actually perform 32 or 64 logical Ands The count of the cardinality of a Tidset intersection is the second most frequent operation in DCI  and is illustrated in Figure 5 In practice due to the bitwise data representations this corresponds to the count of the number of 1bits in a bitmap This bitwise operation is also known as popcount and has an hardware implementation on several modern hardware including NVIDIA GPUs

transactions to allow full multiprocessor occupancy in both cases The adoption of transaction-wise approach is advisable only when the other approach is not suitable due to an unusual large memory occupancy for storing caches to store and reuse intermediate results In the future we plan to improve the gpuDCI algorithm in several directions The most recent version of DCI does not take advantage of the presence of additional CPU or multi-core CPU We plan to extend DCI in order to exploit these additional resources using a parallelization approach similar to the one we adopted for GPU The same computer system can host more than one GPU The algorithm we proposed in this paper makes use of a single GPU However the candidate-wise approach could be easily extended to a larger number of GPUs In some case it is possible to avoid the computation of the support of a pattern by making inferences on some property of its subsets This approach is particularly ef fecti v e for dense datasets and can be applied to gpuDCI  Finally frequent closed itemsets are a condensed representation of frequent itemsets that can be directly computed from the data We plan to improve the efìciency of the DCI based algorithm for extracting these closed patterns by mo ving part of the computation to the GPU References  NVIDIA CUD A Compute Uniìed De vice Architecture Progr Guide V2.0 Technical report 2008  Ramesh C Agarw al Charu C Aggarw al and V  V  V  Prasad A tree projection algorithm for generation of frequent item sets J Parallel Distrib Comput  61\(3 March 2001  Rak esh Agra w al and Ramakrishnan Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases In VLDB  1994  Douglas Burdick Manuel Calimlim Jason Flannick Johannes Gehrke and Tomi Yiu Maìa A maximal frequent itemset algorithm IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng  17\(11 2005  W enbin F ang Mian Lu Xiangye Xiao Bingsheng He and Qiong Luo Frequent itemset mining on graphics processors In Proc 5th Int Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware  DaMoN 2009 2009  Karolien Geurts Geert W ets T om Brijs and K oen Vanhoof Proìling high frequency accident locations using association rules In Proc 82nd Annual Transportation Research Board,Washington DC USA January 12-16  2003  Bart Goethals and Mohammed J Zaki Adv ances in frequent itemset mining implementations report on miê03 SIGKDD Explor Newsl  6\(1 June 2004  Eui-Hong Han Geor ge Karypis and V ipin K umar  Scalable parallel data mining for association rules IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng  12\(3 2000  Jia wei Han Hong Cheng Dong Xin and Xifeng Y an Frequent pattern mining current status and future directions Data Min Knowl Discov  15\(1 August 2007  Jia wei Han Jian Pei Y iwen Y i n and Run ying Mao Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation A frequent-pattern tree approach Data Min Knowl Discov  8\(1 2004  Haifeng Li and Ning Zhang Mining maximal frequent itemsets on graphics processors In Maozhen Li Qilian Liang Lipo Wang and Yibin Song editors FSKD  pages 1461Ö1464 IEEE 2010  Li Liu Eric Li Y imin Zhang and Zhizhong T ang Optimization of frequent itemset mining on multiple-core processor In Proc 33rd int conf on Very large data bases  VLDB 07 VLDB Endowment 2007  Claudio Lucchese Salv atore Orlando and Raf f aele Perego kdci a multi-strategy algorithm for mining frequent sets In FIMI Workshop  2003  Claudio Lucchese Salv atore Orlando and Raf f aele Perego Fast and memory efìcient mining of frequent closed itemsets IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng  18\(1 2006  Salv atore Orlando P aolo P almerini Raf f aele Pere go and Fabrizio Silvestri Adaptive and resource-aware mining of frequent sets In IEEE ICDM  pages 338 345 2002  A Sw ami R Agra w al T  Imielinski Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In SIGMOD  2003  Geor ge T eodoro Nathan Mariano W agner Meira Jr  and Renato Ferreira Tree projection-based frequent itemset mining on multicore cpus and gpus In Proc 22nd Int Symp on Computer Architecture and HPC  SBAC-PAD 10 Washington DC USA 2010 IEEE Computer Society  Mohammed J Zaki P arallel and distrib uted association mining A survey IEEE Concurrency  7\(4 1999  Jiayi Zhou K un-Ming Y u and Bin-Chang W u P ar allel frequent patterns mining algorithm on gpu In SMC  IEEE 2010

Figure 6 is not as signiìcant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
