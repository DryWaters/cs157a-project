High utility sequential pattern mining is an emerging topic in the data mining community Compared to the classic frequent sequence mining the utility framework provides more informative and actionable knowledge since the utility

of a sequence indicates business value and impact However the introduction of utility makes the problem fundamentally different from the frequency-based pattern mining framework and brings about dramatic challenges Although the existing high utility sequential pattern mining algorithms can discover all the patterns satisfying a given  it is often difìcult for users to set a proper minimum utility A too small value may produce thousands of patterns whereas a too big one may lead to no ndings In this paper we propose a novel framework called to tackle this critical problem Accordingly an efìcient

I I NTRODUCTION Frequent sequential pattern mining as one of the fundamental research topics in data mining discovers frequent subsequences in sequence databases It is very useful for handling order-based business problems and has been successfully adopted to various domains and applications such as complex behavior analysis and gene sequence analysis 14 23 In the frequenc y-based frame w ork for typical sequence analysis the also known as   plays a f undamental role in identifying frequent sequential patterns However taking the frequency to measure pattern in 
terestingness may be insufìcient for selecting actionable sequences associated with expected quality and business impact because the patterns identiìed under the frequency support framework do not disclose the business value and impact To solve the above problems the concept 
utility high utility pattern mining high utility sequential pattern mining 
is introduced into sequential pattern mining to select sequences of high utility by considering the quality and value such as proìt of itemsets This leads to an emerging area  11]Ö[13 18 and  3 17 22  25 which selects interesting patterns  sequential patterns based on minimum utility rather than minimum 
support The utility-based patterns are proven to be more informative and actionable for decision-making than the frequency-based ones F or instance in 17 25 the authors discuss the extraction of proìtable behaviors from the mobile commerce environments proposes methods to mine high utility sequences from web logs by assigning each page an impact/signiìcance In a USpan algorithm is built for utility-based sequential pattern mining satisfying a predeìned minimum utility Although algorithms such as USpan can obtain high utility sequences based on a given minimum utility it is very difìcult for users to specify an appropriate minimum utility threshold and to directly obtain the most valuable patterns This is because the complexity of utility-based sequence 
databases which may be different from the classic itemsets determining multiple factors including the distribution of the items and utilities density of the database lengths of the sequences and so on Consequently it is not surprising that with a same minimum utility threshold some datasets may produce millions of patterns while others may contribute nothing The challenge here is that it may not be doable to tune the threshold to capture the expected number of patterns This is because the sensitivity of the threshold makes it hard to tune for a variety of databases It may be very costly and time consuming to achieve the proper threshold for the desired patterns In fact the classic frequency/support based pattern mining 
also faces the same challenge Accordingly the concept of extracting top-k patterns has been proposed in 8 19  to select the patterns with the highest frequenc y  In the top-k frequent pattern mining instead of letting a user specify a threshold the top-k pattern selection algorithms allow a user to set the number of top-k high frequency patterns to be discovered This makes it much easier and more intuitive and practical than determining a minimum support also the determination of k by a user is more straightforward than considering data characteristics which are often invisible to users for choosing a proper threshold

The easiness for users to determine k does not indicate the simplicity of developing an efìcient algorithm for selecting top-k high utility sequential patterns In the utility framework TKU is the only method for mining topk high utility itemsets to the best of our knowledge No work is reported on mining top-k high utility sequences There is signiìcant difference between top-k utility itemset mining and top-k utility sequence mining in which the order between itemsets is considered In fact the problem of topk high utility sequence mining is much more challenging than mining top-k high utility itemsets First as with high utility itemset mining the downward closure property does not hold in the utility-based sequence mining This means that the existing top-k frequent sequential pattern mining algorithms cannot be directly applied Second compared to top-k high utility itemset mining utility-based sequence analysis faces the critical combinational explosion and computational complexity caused by sequencing between itemsets This means that the techniques in cannot be directly transferred to top-k high utility sequential pattern mining either Third since the minimum utility is not given in advance the algorithm essentially starts the searching from 0 minimum support This not only incurs very high computational costs but also the challenge of how to raise the minimum threshold without missing any top-k high utility sequences To address the above challenges this paper proposes an efìcient algorithm to identify Top-k Utility Sequences TUS The contributions of this work are as follows We propose a novel framework for extracting the topk high utility sequential patterns A baseline algorithm TUSNaive is provided accordingly Three strategies are proposed for effectively raising the thresholds at different stages of the mining process Substantial experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that the TUS algorithm can efìciently identify top-k high utility sequences from large scale data with large k The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 deìnes the problem of mining top-k high utility sequential patterns Section 3 details the TUS algorithm Experimental results and evaluation are presented in Section 4 Section 5 concludes the work II P ROBLEM S TATEMENT Let  be a set of distinct A or  is an ordered pair  where represents an item and is a positive number representing the of  e.g the proìt of A or  consists of no less than one u-item which is denoted and deìned as  where is a u-item for  and  where and   For brevity the brackets are omitted if a u-itemset has only one u-item Since the items in an itemset can be listed in any order Without loss of generality we assume that u-items are listed in the alphabetical order A or isan ordered list of u-itemsets which is denoted and deìned as  where is a u-itemset A consists of sets of tuples  where is a unique identiìer of the u-sequence  Readers can refer to for more details Table I U-S EQUENCE D ATABASE SID TID Transactions TU SU 1 1 e,1 15 112 1 2 f,2 28 1 3 d,4 16 1 4 f,3 14 1 5 f,6 39 2 1 d,4 24 117 2 2 f,5 29 2 3 e,3 21 2 4 f,6 6 2 5 f,1 22 2 6 f,1 15 3 1 d,10 44 105 3 2 f,6 17 3 3 d,4 4 3 4 e,5 19 3 5 e,4 14 3 6 d,2 7 Sequence maximum utility Because a sequence may have multiple utility values in the u-sequence context we choose the  as the sequenceês utility The of a sequence is denoted and deìned as  1 For example the utility of is  The maximum utility is  For brevity we use to represent the maximum utility of a sequence i.e  for the rest of the paper Top-k high utility sequential patterns A sequence is called a if there are less than k sequences whose utilities are no less than The is denoted and deìned as  where means the set of top-k high utility sequences Given a u-sequence database and a number  the problem of nding the complete set of top-k high utility sequential patterns in is to discover all the itemsets whose utilities are no less than in  Suppose the desired k number of high utility sequences is set to 7 the top 7 high utility sequences in Table I are shown in Table II The optimal minimum utility threshold If k is set to 3 then only sequences and are obtained and  The reason of

excluding and is to control the number of the candidates no more than k  3 Table II T OP 7 HIGH UTILITY SEQUENCES IN T ABLE I ID Top-k high utility SU 1 Here we present a baseline algorithm called TUSNaive to extract the top-k sequences with the highest utilities Instead of using a user speciìed minimum utility TUSNaive engages a structure named to maintain the top-k high utility sequences on-the-îy TUSList is a xed-size sorted list which is used to maintain the top-k high utility sequential patterns dynamically and a minimum utility of it is set to prune the unpromising candidates in the mining process The mechanism can be briefed as follows Initially the TUSList is empty and is set to 0 In this stage whenever a candidate sequence comes it will be inserted into TUSList and stays on 0 Once the k candidates are found is raised to the utility of the last candidate i.e the least utility canidate in TUSList After that a candidate satisfying is inserted into TUSList then the least utility candidate\(s will be eliminated is thereafter raised to utility of the updated last candidate The process continues until no candidate matches  and those remain in the TUSList are the target patterns The pseudo code of TUSNaive is shown in Algorithm 1 Although TUSNaive correctly extracts the top-k high utility sequences it traverses too many invalid sequence candidates since the minimum threshold starts from 0 This directly degrades the performance of the mining task To overcome this problem we further propose three effective strategies i.e two for raising the minimum utility threshold TUSNaive  Scan for items to be concatenated to  Let be the item and  TUSList TUSNaive  TUSList and one for reducing the search space to improve the performance We start from the pre-insertion strategy Strategy Pre-insertion The pre-insertion strategy inserts the utilities of both the 1-sequences and u-sequences to the TUSList before the mining process The pre-insertion is an effective strategy for rasing the minimum utility in TUSList After the raw sequences are successfully stored in the memory it needs to calculate the utility of each sequence In this phase we use a hash table to record the maximum utility of every distinct item in the sequences For example in Table I the maximum utility of in is the utility of  i.e 21 The other maximum utilities are After is nished itself will be inserted into the TUSList and labeled as a u-sequence The purpose is to prevent the sequence from being double-inserted otherwise it will miss truly top-k high utility sequences Similarly after and are scanned the 1-sequences will be calculated and added to the hash table and both and will be inserted into the TUSList After the sequences are scanned the hash table is a:45 b:40 c:52 d:32 e:9 f:18  All of the items are actually 1-sequences they are all inserted into the TUSList With the three u-sequences and their utilities the utilities in the TUSList is  and the minimum utility after pre-insertion As seen from the example the pre-insertion strategy effectively raises the minimum threshold to a reasonable level before mining and prevents from generating unpromising candidates The strategy is applied in the main mining process It effectively identiìes potential high utility sequences and the utilities can be calculated and inserted into TUSList prior to those low utility sequences As a result the minimum utility quickly raises to without traversing too many invalid candidates and the efìciency is therefore substantially improved Now we discuss the method in details The term means an item is appended to a k-sequence to obtain a k+1 There are two types of concatenations I-Concatenation and S-Concatenation SConcatenation means an item is appended as a 1-itemset

SConcatenates to result in  and the I-Concatenation leads to  More examples are in Figure 1 A sequential pattern mining algorithm usually follows a pattern-growth method to mine the expected sequences The proposed TUS and TUSNaive algorithm as mentioned above are in this class For example in Figure 1 one of the searching paths is Once this path is over it will recursively search the other branches until no more candidates left Suppose we are standing on the root Wehave6 different ways that is to  to choose to continue the mining process Which one should we concatenate to the root rst Once the rst candidate and its offsprings are nished checking what order should be applied to the others Does it make difference In threshold-based high utility sequence mining there is no such concerns Because the minimum utility is a xed number from the beginning to the end It means that whatever order is used the candidates they checked are always the same However in the top-k framework the order of concatenating items does matter Since is dependent on the candidate inside the TUSList we should put the high utility candidates to TUSList as soon as possible so that increases to shortly Now we present a few deìnitions to illustrate the concepts Ending u-item and pivot Suppose that all the u in the u are listed alphabetically Let be a u-sequence be a sequence and  Assume that  where  and  is called the of in  Additionally is called or iffthereisno where and such that  For example the ending u-items of in are  and  where the pivot is For in the ending u-items are and  Ending u-item maximum utility The ending u-item maximum utility is denoted and deìned as 2 where is a sequence is a u-sequence is an ending u-item of in  Speciìcally we use to denote the pivot maximum utility i.e 3 where is the pivot For example  and  Obviously the ending u-item utility of a sequence is a subset of the utility of itself The pivot maximum utility of is  Sequence-Projected Utilization The Sequence-Projected Utilization SPU of a sequence in is denoted and deìned as 4 where is the pivot of in  and 5 means the sum of the utilities of the u-items after the pivot exclusive For example and  The meaning of is the pivot utility plus the rest u-sequence utility For example  Similarly and  Therefore  Item concatenation order Given a sequence and two items Let and be the sequences of and concatenated to respectively where We say is prior to  denoted as  if either of following conditions is true or and i is I-Concatenated from  and is S-Concatenated from or ii both and are I-Concatenated or S-Concatenated from but is alphabetically smaller than  Generally means that the utilities of s offspring candidates are likely higher than that of  Taking in Figure  as an example in u-sequence 1 items  and can be I-Concatenated to  and the sare  and respectively Obviously holds in u-sequence 1 It also reveals the fact that  The S-Concatenation is also in the situation For example

We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of TUS in terms of computational costs on datasets to  Different strategies were compared to show their corresponding performance on the datasets as well In Figure 2 TUSNaive refers to TUNaive with SRU TUSNaive+I refers to TUNaive with SRU and pre-insertion TUSNaive+S refers to TUNaive with SRU and sorting The results show that TUS is generally 10 1000 times faster than TUSNaive For DS4 TUSNaive cannot nish the mining with a very small k with k  20 in 24 hours Besides the gap between TUS and TUSNaive increases with the increase of k The results also show that TUS TUSNaive+I and TUSNaive+S are generally faster than TUSNaive from Figure 2 That indicates the proposed three optimization measures including  sorting and preinsertion are effective for top-k pattern mining Generally TUSNaive+I is faster than TUSNaive+S when k is small After k exceeds a certain number TUSNaive+S outperforms TUSNaive+I For example k  1000 in Figure 2\(a Figure 2\(d k  2000 in Figure 2\(b k  20 in Figure 2\(c This is because TUSNaive+S starts the mining from 0 while TUSNaive+I does not pre-insertion directly prunes unpromising branches than the sorting strategy The sorting strategy always traverses the higher estimated utility candidates rst This guarantees raising to shortly while TUSNaive+I does not So when k is large sorting is better than pre-insertion V C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we have proposed an efìcient algorithm named TUS for mining top-k high utility sequential patterns from utility-based sequence databases TUS guarantees there is no sequence missed during the mining process We have developed a new sequence boundary and a corresponding pruning strategy for effectively ltering the unpromising candidates Moreover a pre-insertion and a sorting strategy has been introduced to raise the minimum utility threshold The mining performance is enhanced signiìcantly since both the search space and the number of candidates are effectively reduced by the proposed strategies Both synthetic and real datasets have been used to evaluate the performance of TUS which is shown to substantially outperform the baseline algorithms and the performance of TUS is close to the optimal case of the state-of-the-art utility sequential pattern mining algorithms R EFERENCES  R Agra w al and R Srikant

C  i  that we compute on-the-\037y in our algorithm His structure consists basically of the compressed suf\036x array and a unary coding of the frequency values in the inorder of the virtual suf\036x tree Sadakane shows that the 036nal structure occupies  CSA  2 n  o  n  bits where  CSA  is the size of the compressed suf\036x array used He does not give a space-ef\036cient construction algorithm a suf\036x tree is used as an intermediate stru cture hence taking O  n log n  bits We can construct the required unary coding during our algorithm as follows We maintain the balanced parentheses BP representation as in 32 u s i ng a dynami c b i t v ect or occupying n  o  n  bits This gives us the preorder of the virtual suf\036x tree nodes at each step We use another dynamic bit-vector to store the C counter values in the same unary coding as Sadakane uses Using rank and select  select  i  returns the position of the i th 1 19 on bot h bit-vectors gives us a mapping between BP bit-vector and the C counter bit-vector Inserting a new node in BP means inserting 1 in the corresponding place of the C counter bitvector Incrementing a C counter works by 036nding the corresponding node in BP mapping the position to C counter bit-vector and inserting 0 there Finally after all values are computed the preorder of C counter bit-vector can be turned into the inorder used i n Sadakaneís scheme and the intermediate structures can be deleted The algorithm uses the same space and time as reported in Theorem 1 6 Experimental Results We have implemented the algorithm from  4inC 3 and compared it to the C++-implementation of the optimal algorithm from  3 Our implementation deviates from our theoretical proposal as we use a compressed suf\036x array that is based on sampling  We use a standard sampling rate of log n that minimize the space us age as this is the main objective of our approach However we will also see that a smaller 036xed sampling rate d rastically decreases the execution time while leading only to a moderate increase in space usage We present test results of time and maximum memory usage for different datasets of protein and genome data 6.1 Protein Datasets We used two datasets consisting of the primary structure of all protein data from human and mouse which were obtained from Swissprot using the keywords HUMAN and MOUSE in the NEWT taxonomy browser The human dataset  D 1  contained 71,622 proteins of total length 013 27.3MB and the mouse dataset  D 2  contained 62,562 3 The implementation can be downloaded from http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/suds proteins of total length 013 26.3MB It is interesting to compare these data sets because the genome of human and mouse is known to be largely the same but given the different phenotype of the two species must contain some signi\036cant differences All tests on protein data were run on a 3.0GHz Intel Pentium 4 CPU with 3GB of main memory All output was redirected to the nullî-device in order to remove in\037uences from secondary storage units The programs were tested both on mining frequent substrings Probl 1 and emerging substrings Probl 2 The results for the frequent substring mining are reported in Tbl 1 Here the maximum support threshold 006 for D 2 was 036xed to  95  The more striking propert y of the space-ef\036cient algorithm is that it uses only 183.1MB of memory while the optimal algorithm needs 1,267.3MB This means a space reduction of a factor of 013 6  9  As already mentioned in the introduction space is often a more critical resource than time e.g users are often willing to wait 3ñ4 hours instead of 3 minutes if this allows them to apply their methods to much bigger data sets Table 1 Running time s seconds for mining frequent strings for the optimal   3 and the space-efﬁcient   4 algorithm 005 is the minimum support threshold for D 1  The maximum support threshold 006 was held xed at  95  The last column denotes the size of the output 005 optimal space-ef\036cient  output  1 154.4 12,426 3,559 2 151.5 12,403 1,211 3 154.9 12,565 953 4 156.5 12,442 694 5 155.8 12,558 436 6 152.6 13,420 196 7 154.1 12,445 49 8 155.2 12,524 7 9 151.3 12,672 2 avg 154.0 12,606.1  The running times for the emerging substring tasks are reported in Tbl 2 for 005 g 1  3333  and Tbl 3 for 005 g  2  0  The results are largely along the lines of the frequent string mining tasks space is reduced by a factor of 6ñ7 and the running time is increased by about two orders of magnitude To give an idea on how the dataset length affects computation time and space usage we tested mining frequent substrings from different size pre\036xes of the protein data Tests were run on dataset pre\036xes of total length 2ñ50MB and on the whole dataset of length 013 53.6MB Here the maxi

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
