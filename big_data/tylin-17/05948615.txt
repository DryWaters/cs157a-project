has been carried out for the computation of items and itemsets that exceed a frequency threshold The mining approach is hybrid that is frequent items are calculated with a single pass using a sketch algorithm while frequent itemsets are calculated by a further multi-pass analysis The architecture combines parallel and distributed processing to keep the pace with the rate of distributed data streams In order to keep computation close to data miners are distributed among the domains where data streams are generated The paper also reports the experimental results obtained with a prototype of the architecture tested on a Grid composed of two domains handling two different data streams 
Keywords distributed data mining frequent items frequent itemsets Grids stream mining I I NTRODUCTION Mining data streams is a very important research topic and has recently attracted a lot of attention because in many cases data is generated by external sources so rapidly that it may become impossible to store it and analyze it of”ine Moreover in some cases streams of data must be analyzed in real time to provide information about trends outlier values or regularities that must be signaled as soon as possible The need for online computation is a notable challenge with respect to classical data mining algorithms 2 Important application elds for stream mining are as diverse 
as nancial applications network monitoring security problems telecommunication networks Web applications sensor networks analysis of atmospheric data etc A further dif“culty occurs when streams are distributed and mining models must be derived not only for the data of a single stream but for the integration of multiple and heterogeneous data streams This scenario can occur in all the application domains mentioned before For example in a Content Distribution Network user requests delivered to a Web system can be forwarded to any of several servers located in different and possibly distant places in order to serve requests more ef“ciently and balance the load In 
such a context the analysis of user requests for example to discover frequent patterns must be performed with the inspection of data streams detected by different servers Another notable application eld is the analysis of packets processed by the routers of an IP network In any distributed scenario it is essential that miners are located as close to data sources as possible in order to limit the overhead of data communication When there is the need for performing multiple passes on data the presence of data cachers can help provided that they are also distributed appropriately Sometimes the rate of a single data stream can be so fast that a single computing node can have dif“culties to keep 
the pace with the generation of data In these cases it can be useful to sample the data stream instead of processing all the data b ut of course this can lo wer the accurac y of derived models depending on the sampling frequency and the adopted algorithm A different or complementary solution is to partition a data stream among a set of miners so that each miner processes only a fraction of data This solution can be achieved by parallelizing the computation over the nodes of a cluster or can also be implemented by exploiting the multiple CPUs/GPUs offered by modern multicore and manycore machines Two important and recurrent problems regarding the anal 
ysis of data streams are the computation of frequent items and frequent itemsets from transactional datasets The rst problem is very popular both for its simplicity and because it is often used as a subroutine for more complex problems The goal is to nd in a sequence of items those whose frequency exceeds a speci“ed threshold When the items are generated in the form of transactions  sets of distinct items  it is also useful to discover frequent sets of items A k-itemset  i.e a set of k distinct items is said to be 
frequent if those items concurrently appear in a speci“ed fraction of transactions The discovery of frequent itemsets is essential to cope with many data mining problems such as the computation of association rules classi“cation models data clusters etc This task can be severely time consuming since the number of candidates is combinatorial with their allowed size The technique usually adopted is to rst discover frequent items and then build candidate itemsets incrementally exploiting the Apriori property which states that an i itemset can be frequent only if all of its

subsets are also frequent While there are some proposals in the literature to mine frequent itemsets in a single pass it is recognized that in the general case in which the generation rate is fast it is very dif“cult to solve the problem without allowing multiple passes on the data stream The architecture we designed and present in this paper addresses the issues mentioned above by exploiting the following main features  the architecture combines the parallel and distributed paradigms the rst to keep the pace with the rate of a single data stream by using multiple miners processors or cores the second to cope with the distributed nature of data streams Miners are distributed among the domains where data streams are generated in order to keep computation close to data  the computation of frequent items is performed through sketch algorithms These algorithms maintain a matrix of counters and each item of the input stream is associated with a set of counters one for each row of the table through hash functions The statistical analysis of counter values allows item frequencies to be estimated with the desired accuracy Sketch algorithms compute a linear projection of the input thanks to this property sketches of data can be computed separately for different stream sources and can then be integrated to produce the overall sketch  the approach is hybrid  meaning that frequent items are calculated online with a single pass while frequent itemsets are calculated by a further multi-pass analysis This kind of approach allows important information to be derived on the y without imposing too strict time constraints on more complex tasks such as the extraction of frequent k-itemsets as this could excessively lower the accuracy of models  to support the mentioned hybrid approach the architecture exploits the presence of data cachers on which recent data can be stored In particular miners can turn to data cachers to retrieve the statistics about frequent items and use them to identify frequent sets of items To avoid excessive communication overhead data cachers are distributed and placed close to stream sources and miners To the best of our knowledge this is one of the rst attempts to combine the four mentioned characteristics In particular we are not aware of attempts to combine the parallel and distributed paradigms in stream mining nor of implemented systems that adopt the hybrid singlepass/multi-pass approach though this kind of strategy is suggested and fostered in the recent literature The major advantages of the proposed architecture are its scalability and exibility Indeed the architecture can ef“ciently exploit the presence of multiple miners and can be adapted to the requirements of speci“c scenarios for example the use of parallel miners can be avoided when a single miner can keep the pace of a single stream and the use of data cachers is not necessary if mining frequent itemsets is not required or if the stream rate is so slow that they can be computed on the y Beyond presenting the architecture we describe a prototype that implements it and discuss a set of experiments performed in a Grid environment composed of two domains handling two data streams In this scenario we computed frequent items and itemsets for two well known datasets Kosarak and WebDocs  and we analyzed the processing time when changing the number of miners available in each domain and the rate of the data streams The rest of the paper is structured as follows Section II summarizes the main issues regarding the mining of data streams and illustrates the most common algorithms for the computation of frequent items and itemsets Section III describes the proposed parallel/distributed architecture for mining data streams and discusses the adopted hybrid approach Section IV describes the prototype and the testbed scenario and reports the related results Section V discusses related work and Section VI concludes the paper and gives hints for future research avenues II M INING F REQUENT I TEMS AND F REQUENT I TEMSETS IN D ISTRIBUTED D ATA S TREAMS Data stream analysis is often performed with randomized and approximated algorithms since exact and deterministic algorithms would require too much computing time or memory space Accordingly data mining algorithms for data stream analysis are generally evaluated with respect to three metrics  The processing time of the operations that update the data structures and the mining models after the arrival of a new stream item  The storage space used by the algorithm  The accuracy of the approximated algorithm in general speci“ed through two parameters set by the user the accuracy parameter 002 and the failure probability 003  which means that the estimation error is at most 002 with probability 1  003   Of course processing time and storage size strongly depend on these parameters One of the most important issues is the discovery of frequent items  consisting of identifying the items whose frequency in a stream exceeds a speci“ed fraction 004 of the overall stream size This problem has a huge number of applications in a variety of scenarios frequent items can be the most popular destinations of IP packets the most frequent queries submitted to a search engine the most common values observed by sensors in a wireless environment etc Moreover frequent items are often used as the basis for more complex analysis processes The problem is formalized as follows

P ROBLEM STATEMENT  Given a stream S of n items e 1   e n  where the frequency of an item i is f i   j  e j  i   and a frequency threshold 004  the 002 approximate-frequent-items problem consists of nding the set F of items such that F   i  f i 002  004  002  n  Two basic categories of algorithms can be used to solve this problem the Counter-Based and the Sketch-Based algorithms The algorithms of the rst type maintain counters for a subset of elements and counters are updated every time one of these elements is observed in the stream If the observed element has no associated counter the algorithm must choose whether to ignore the element or replace an existing counter with a counter for the new item At the end of the rst pass frequent items will surely be among those associated with counters but the inverse is not true which requires at least a second pass to verify which counters actually correspond to frequent items Some of the most used Counter-Based algorithms are the SpaceSaving algorithm and the LossyCounting algorithm Conversely Sketch-Based algorithms do not monitor a subset of elements but provide with a given accuracy an estimation of the frequency for all stream elements using a matrix of counters C with d rows and w columns A set of d hash functions h 1   h d are chosen among a family of pairwise-independent functions and are associated to the different matrix rows Each item i observed in the stream is mapped for each row r  to the matrix element C  r h r  i   This counter is then modi“ed depending on the speci“c sketch algorithm in CountMin  at the arri v al of a ne w item i  the counter is incremented as follows see Figure 1 for r 003 1 d  004 C  r h r  i   1 Figure 1 CountMin Algorithm A new item is associated for each row to a different entry computed with a hash function which is then incremented The number of counters in a row w  is lower than the number of elements so there are con”icts because several distinct elements will be mapped by a hash function to the same counter However different elements are in con”ict for different rows which enables the adoption of statistical techniques to estimate the actual frequencies of elements In CountMin  collisions always cause extra increments of counters therefore the best estimation for the frequency f i of element i is the minimum value of the counters associated to i  f i  min r  C  r h r  i   Of course the accuracy of sketch algorithms increases with the size of the matrix since a larger matrix reduces the frequency of collisions of different elements on the same counter In CountMin  setting d  005 ln 1 002 006 and w  005 e 003 006 ensures that f i  in a stream with n elements has error at most 002n with probability of at least 1  003  The spatial complexity is O  e 003 ln 1 002  while the time for update is O ln 1 002   More details about CountMin can be found in Here it is worth recalling that this algorithm as all the sketch algorithms has the important property that the sketch is a linear projection of the input This means that the overall sketch of multiple streams can be computed by adding the sketches of the single streams Thus is the main reason why we decided to adopt CountMin  in a distributed architecture it would be prohibitive to transmit source data to a central processing node while the mere transmission of sketch summaries allows overhead communications to be drastically reduced The computation of frequent itemsets can either be performed directly or by exploiting the statistics of frequent items The direct computation in a single pass is feasible only if the stream rate is moderate due to the large number of candidate frequent itemsets For example in a h ybrid approach is used rst a counter-based algorithm computes the candidate 2-itemsets then a second pass is necessary to eliminate the false candidates nally the Apriori property is exploited to nd the frequent i-itemsets for i 2  The merit of hybrid approaches is that they try to combine the best of single-pass and multiple-pass algorithms and can be particularly ef“cient in a distributed scenario In our architecture frequent items are computed on the y with CountMin  and the results stored in distributed data cachers are used to compute frequent itemsets III A H YBRID M ULTI D OMAIN A RCHITECTURE The stream mining architecture presented in this paper aims at solving the problem of computing frequent items and frequent itemsets from distributed data streams exploiting a hybrid single-pass/multiple-pass strategy It is assumed that stream sources though belonging to different domains are homogenous so that it is useful to extract knowledge from their union Typical cases are the analysis of the traf“c experienced by several routers of a wide area network or the analysis of client requests forwarded to multiple web servers Miner nodes are located close to the streams so that data transmitted between different domains only consists of models sketches not raw data The architecture depicted in Figure 2 includes the following components  Data Streams DS  located in different domains

Figure 2 Distributed architecture for data stream mining  Miners M  They are placed close to the respective Data Streams and perform two basic mining tasks the computation of sketches for the discovery of frequent items and the computation of the support count of candidate frequent itemsets If a single Miner is unable to keep the pace of the local DS the stream items can be partitioned and forwarded to a set of Miners which operate in parallel Each Miner computes the sketch only for the data it receives and then forwards the results to the local Stream Manager Parallel Miners can be associated to the nodes of a cluster or to the cores of a manycore machine  Stream Managers SM in each domain the Stream Manager collects the sketches computed by local miners and derives the sketch for the local DS Moreover each SM cooperates with the Stream Manager Coordinator to compute global statistics valid for the union of all the Data Streams  Stream Managers Coordinator SMC this node collects mining models from different domains and computes overall statistics regarding frequent items and frequent itemsets The SMC can coincide with one of the Stream Managers and can be chosen with an election algorithm In the gure the SM of the domain on the left also takes the role of SMC  Data Cachers DC are essential to enable the hybrid strategy Each Data Cacher stores the statistics about frequent items discovered in the local domain These results are then re-used by Miners to discover frequent itemsets composed of increasing numbers of items The algorithm for the computation of frequent items outlined in Figure 3 is performed continuously for every new block of data that is generated by the data streams A block is de“ned here as the set of transactions that are generated in a time interval P  If the generation rate is too fast to be sustained by a single Miner a lter is used to partition the block into as many mini-blocks as Figure 3 Schema of the algorithm for mining frequent items the number of available miners step 1 in the gure Each Miner computes the sketch related to the received miniblock step 2 and transmits it to the SM step 3 which overlaps the sketches thanks to the linearity property of sketch algorithms and extracts the frequent items for the local domain Then two concurrent operations are executed every SM sends the local sketch to the SMC step 4a and the Miners send the most recent blocks of transactions to the local Data Cacher step 4b The last operation is necessary to later compute the frequent itemsets At step 5 the SMC aggregates the sketches received by SMs and identi“es the items that are frequent for the union of data streams Frequent items are computed for a window containing the most recent W blocks This can be done easily thanks to the linearity of the sketch algorithm at the arrival of a new block the sketch of this block is added to the current sketch of the window while the sketch of the least recent block is subtracted The window-based approach is common because most interesting results are generally related to recent data  Sketch-based algorithms are only capable of computing frequent items  To discover frequent itemsets  it is necessary to perform multiple passes on the data Candidate k itemsets are constructed starting from frequent k…1 itemsets More speci“cally at the rst step candidate 2-itemsets are all the possible pairs of frequent items Miners must compute the support for these pairs to determine which of them are frequent In the following steps a candidate k itemset is obtained by adding any frequent item to the frequent k 1 itemsets Thanks to the Apriori property candidates can be pruned by checking if all the k…1 subsets are frequent a k itemset can be frequent only if all the subsets are frequent The approach allows us to compute both itemsets that are frequent for a single domain and those that are frequent for the union of distributed streams Figure 4 shows an example of how frequent 3-itemsets are computed The top part of the gure reports items and 2-itemsets that are frequent for 
248 


the two considered domains and for the whole system The candidate 3-itemsets computed by the two SMs and by the SMC are then reported before and after the pruning based on the Apriori property In the bottom part the gure reports the support counts computed for the two domains and for the whole system Finally the SMs check which candidates exceed the speci“ed threshold in this case set to 10 notice that the  abc  itemset is frequent globally though it is locally frequent in only one of the two domains In general it can happen that an itemset occurs frequently for a single domain and infrequently globally or vice versa therefore it is necessary to separately perform the two kinds of computations Figure 4 Example of the computation of frequent 3-itemsets Figure 5 Schema of the algorithm for mining frequent itemsets The schema of the algorithm for mining frequent itemsets is illustrated in Figure 5 It assumes that the steps indicated in Figure 3 have already been performed At step 6 every SM builds the candidate k-itemsets for the local domain 6a and the SMC also builds the global candidate k-itemsets 6b The SMC sends the global candidates to the SMs for the computation of their support at the different domains step 7 The SMs send both local and global candidates to the Miners step 8 which turn to the Data Cacher to retrieve the transactions included in the current window step 9 1  compute the support count for all the candidates and transmit the results to the local SM step 10 The SM aggregates the support counts received by Miners and selects the k-itemsets that are frequent in the local domain step 11 Analogously the SMs send the SMC the support counts of the global candidates step 12 and the SMC computes the itemsets that are frequent over the whole system step 13 The algorithm restarts from step 6 to nd frequent itemsets with increasing numbers of items The cycle stops either when the maximum allowed size of itemsets is reached or when no frequent itemset was found in the last iteration IV P ROTOTYPE AND P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION The architecture described in the previous section was implemented starting from the Mining@Home system Mining@Home  a Java-based framework partly inspired by the Public Computing paradigm was adopted to perform several classes of data mining computations among which the analysis of astronomical data to search for gravitational waves and the disco v ery of closed frequent itemsets with parallel algorithms The main features of the stream mining prototype inherited from Mining@Home  are the pull approach Miners are assigned jobs on the basis of their availability and the adoption of Data Cachers to store reusable data Moreover some important modi“cations were necessary to adapt the framework to the stream mining scenario for example the selection of the Miners that are the most appropriate to perform the mining tasks is subject to vicinity constraints because in a streaming environment it is very important that the analysis of data be performed close to the data source Another notable modi“cation is the adoption of the hybrid approach for the single-pass computation of frequent items and the multi-pass computation of frequent itemsets Experiments were performed on the ICAR-CNR Grid We used two clusters connected by a router to test a scenario with two domains and two data streams The rst cluster has eight Cpu Intel Xeon E5520 nodes with four 2.27 GHz processors and 24 GB Ram the second cluster has eight Intel Itanium nodes with two 1.5 GHz CPU and 4 GB Ram The Miners and the Stream Managers were installed on the nodes of the clusters while the Data Streams and the Data Cachers were put on different nodes external to the clusters All the nodes run Linux and the software components are written in Java To assess the prototype we used the transactional datasets published by the FIMI Reposity  Some of these datasets are originated by data streams so they are appropriate for our analysis In particular 1 Miners may have the ability to store some transactions in their own memory In this case they only ask the Data Cacher those transactions that could not be stored locally

 The kosarak dataset contains a list of click-streams generated by users of an online portal The analysis of user visits can be useful to identify the most popular sections of the portal the preferences and requirements of users etc  the webDocs dataset is generated from a set of Web pages Each page after the application of a ltering algorithm is represented with a set of signi“cant words included in it The analysis of most frequent words or sets of words can be useful to devise caching policies indexing techniques etc Basic information about the two datasets is summarized below

prototype are listed below  P  the time interval that delimits a block of data This interval determines the average number of transactions generated within a block denoted as N t  and the average size of a block in bytes B   N M  the number of available miners per domain assuming that this number is the same for the two domains  F CPU  the fraction of CPU time dedicated by miners to mining jobs In the experiments this parameter is tuned using the program cpulimit 2   S  the support threshold used to determine frequent items and itemsets  W  the number of blocks contained in the sliding window  C M  the capacity of the miner buffer expressed in bytes In the experiments the buffer size is set so as to contain the most recent block of data  002 and 003  the accuracy parameters of the sketch algorithm which are both set to 0.01  the maximum size of candidate itemsets set to 5 for Kosarak and to 8 for Webdocs The main performance index assessed during the experiments is the average execution time  i.e the time necessary to compute frequent items and frequent itemsets at the arrival of a new block of data If this value is not longer than the time interval P  it means that the system is able to keep the pace with data production A Experiments with the dataset Kosarak The experiments were executed assuming a time period P equal to 15 s  The generation rates were compatible with the Web sites of Wikipedia Microsoft and Ebay as estimated using the Web site http://www.webtraf“c24.com  2 http://cpulimit.sourceforge.net These rates correspond respectively to values of N t equal to about 20,000 15,000 and 10,000 transactions per block The generation rates were equally partitioned between the two domains Notice that these are very high generation rates and allowed the prototype to be tested in challenging conditions 30 of the CPU time was dedicated by miners to the mining jobs the frequency threshold S was set to 0.02 and the window size was set to 5 blocks Figure 6 reports the average execution time experienced for the computation of frequent items exclusively I and for the computation of both frequent items and itemsets I+IS vs the number of miners per domain N M  The gure shows that the processing time decreases as the number of miners increases which con“rms that the architecture is scalable Scalability is ensured by two main factors the linearity property of the sketch algorithm and the placement of data cachers close to the miners The dashed line corresponding to an execution time equal to the time period P 15 seconds is used to check if the system is stable when the index is lower than the dashed line the system is able to keep pace with the generation of stream data This condition is always veri“ed when the system is only asked to compute frequent items On the other hand the computation of frequent itemsets is much more time consuming and results show that a single miner per domain is not suf“cient depending on the generation rate two three or four miners are needed to keep the processing time below the period length P  Figure 7 shows the average execution time measured when setting the value of N t to 15,000 and varying the support threshold S  This parameter does not in”uence the time to execute the frequent items algorithm which is executed in a single pass therefore the gure reports the results regarding the combined computation of frequent items and frequent itemsets I+IS As expected a lower value of the threshold leads to an increase of the processing time since the number of frequent itemsets computed at each step of the algorithm see Figure 5 is larger B Experiments with the dataset Webdocs A second set of experiments was performed taking the dataset Webdocs as input of the data stream As the dataset contains representative words of Web pages ltered by a search engine the data rate was set to typical values registered by servers of Google and Altavista again using the site http://www.webtraf“c24.com to do the estimation The considered values for N t were 500 1500 and 3000 transactions with the time period P set to 15 seconds A single transaction contains on average many more items than the Kosarak dataset so the size of a block in bytes is larger for example with N t  1500  the value of B is about 750 KBytes while it was about 150 Kbytes with Kosarak As for the previous set of tests the percentage of the CPU time dedicated by miners to the mining jobs was set to 30 the

frequent sets of items in transactional databases A rich survey of algorithms for discovering frequent items is provided by Cormode and Hadjieleftheriou In their paper  discussion focuses on the two main classes of algorithms for nding frequent items Counter-based algorithms have their foundation on some techniques proposed in the early 80s to solve the Majority problem i.e the problem of nding a majority element in a stream using a single counter Variants of this algorithm were devised sometimes decades later to discover items whose frequencies exceed any given threshold LossyCounting is perhaps the most popular algorithm of this type The second class of algorithms compute a sketch  i.e a linear projection of the input and provide an approximated estimation of item frequencies using limited computing and memory resources Popular algorithms of this kind are CountSketch and CountMin and the latter is adopted in this paper  Advantages and limitations of sketch algorithms are discussed in Important adv antages are the notable space ef“ciency required space is logarithmic in the number of distinct items the possibility of naturally dealing with negative updates and item deletions and the linear property which allows sketches of multiple streams to be computed by overlapping the sketches of single streams The main limitation is the underlying assumption that the domain size of the data stream is large but this is true in many signi“cant domains Even if modern single-pass algorithms are extremely sophisticated and powerful multi-pass algorithms are still necessary either when the stream rate is too rapid or when the problem is inherently related to the execution of multiple passes which is the case for example of the frequent itemsets problem Single-pass algorithms can be forced to check the frequency of 2or 3-itemsets but this approach cannot be generalized easily as the number of candidate k itemsets is combinatorial and it can become very large when increasing the value of k  Therefore a v ery promising avenue could be to devise hybrid approaches which try to combine the best of singleand multiple-pass algorithms A strategy of this kind discussed in is adopted in the mining architecture presented in this paper The analysis of streams is even more challenging when data is produced by different sources spread in a distributed environment A thorough discussion of the approaches currently used to mine multiple data streams can be found in The paper distinguishes between the centralized model under which streams are directed to a central location before they are mined and the distributed model in which distributed computing nodes perform part of the computation close to the data and send to a central site only the models not the data Of course the distributed approach has notable advantages in terms of degree of parallelism and scalability An interesting approach for the continuous tracking of complex queries over collections of distributed streams is presented in T o reduce the communication o v erhead the adopted strategy combines two technical solutions i remote sites only communicate to the coordinator concise summary information on local streams in the form of sketches ii even such communications are avoided when the behavior of local streams remains reasonably stable or predictable updates of sketches are only transmitted when a certain amount of change is observed locally The success of this strategy depends on the level of approximation on the results that is tolerated A similar approach is adopted in here stream data is sent to the central processor after being ltered at remote data sources The lters adapt to changing conditions to minimize stream rates while guaranteeing that the central processor still receives the updates necessary to provide answers of adequate precision VI C ONCLUSIONS In recent years the progress in digital data production and pervasive computing technology have made it possible to produce and store large streams of data Data mining techniques became vital to analyze such large and continuous streams of data for detecting regularities and outlier values in them In particular when data production is massive and/or distributed decentralized architectures and algorithms are needed for its analysis The distributed stream mining system presented in this paper is a contribution in the eld and it aims at solving the problem of computing frequent items and frequent itemsets from distributed data streams by exploiting a hybrid singlepass/multiple-pass strategy We assumed that stream sources though belonging to different domains are homogenous so that it is useful to extract knowledge from their union Beyond presenting the system architecture we described a prototype that implements it and discussed a set of experiments performed in a real Grid environment The experimental results con“rm that the approach is scalable and can manage large data production by using an appropriate number of miners in the distributed architecture R EFERENCES  M M Gaber  A Zasla vsk y  and S Krishnasw amy  Mining data streams A review

handled by existing algorithms due to memory saturation Our algorithms thus removed the lock that prevented the use of gradual patterns analysis in realistic applications Our work opens several perspectives An immediate perspective is to cooperate with practitioners having large numerical datasets in order to help them extracting and analyzing gradual datasets Reporting the results of such experiments will allow to show the practical interest of gradual pattern and hopefully lead to further research in the 002eld of gradual pattern mining Other perspectives lie in the improvement of our algorithms Currently our algorithm always uses the same binary matrices whatever the gradual itemset under consideration However has sho wn that the binary matrices could be reduced some transactions never appear in the support of a pattern so the corresponding lines and columns can be suppressed from the corresponding binary matrix This optimization would not reduce the theoretical complexity however the FIMI workshop results 22 sho wed that reducing databases was one of the keys for reducing practical run time A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Benjamin N  egrevergne for providing them the Melinda library R EFERENCES  R Agra w al and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules in Proceedings of the 20th VLDB Conference  1994 pp 487–499  J Pei J Han B Mortaza vi-As l H Pinto Q Chen U Dayal and M Hsu Pre\002xspan Mining sequential patterns by pre\002x-projected growth in ICDE  2001 pp 215–224  T  Asai K Abe S Ka w asoe H Arimura H Sakamoto and S Arikawa Ef\002cient substructure discovery from large semistructured data in In Proc of the Second SIAM International Conference on Data Mining SDM2002 Arlington VA  Avril 2002 pp 158–174  A Inokuchi T  W ashio and H Motoda  An apriori-based algorithm for mining frequent substructures from graph data in PKDD  2000 pp 13–23  R Srikant and R Agra w al Mining quantitati v e association rules in large relational tables in SIGMOD Conference  1996 pp 1–12  Y  Aumann and Y  Lindell  A statistical theory for quantitative association rules J Intell Inf Syst  vol 20 no 3 pp 255–283 2003  T  W ashio Y  Mitsunag a and H Motoda Mining quantitative frequent itemsets using adaptive density-based subspace clustering in ICDM  2005 pp 793–796  L Di Jorio A Laurent and M T ei sseire Mining frequent gradual itemsets from large databases in Int Conf on Intelligent Data Analysis IDA'09  2009  N P asquier  Yv es Y  Bastide R T aouil and L Lakhal Ef\002cient mining of association rules using closed itemset lattices Information Systems  vol 24 pp 25–46 1999  B Goethals Fimi repository website  http://\002mi.cs.helsinki.\002 2003-2004  T  Uno M Kiyomi and H Arimura Lcm v er  2 Ef 002cient mining algorithms for frequent/closed/maximal itemsets in FIMI  2004  B Ne gre v er gne A T ermier  J.-F  Mehaut and T  Uno Discovering closed frequent itemsets on multicore Parallelizing computations and optimizing memory accesses in The 2010 International Conference on High Performance Computing  Simulation HPCS 2010  2010 pp 521–528  H Arimura and T  Uno  An output-polynomial time algorithm for mining frequent closed attribute trees in 15th International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming ILP'05  2005  F  Berzal J.-C Cubero D Sanchez M.-A V ila and J M Serrano An alternative approach to discover gradual dependencies Int Journal of Uncertainty Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems IJUFKS  vol 15 no 5 pp 559 570 2007  E H  ullermeier Association rules for expressing gradual dependencies in Proc of the 6th European Conf on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery PKDD'02  Springer-Verlag 2002 pp 200–211  A Laurent B N  egrevergne N Sicard and A Termier Pgpmc Towards a multicore parallel approach for mining gradual patterns in DASFAA 1  2010 pp 78–84  S A youni A Laurent S B Y ahia and P  Poncelet Mining closed gradual patterns in 10th International Conference on Arti\002cial Intelligence and Soft Computing ICAISC 2010  ser LNCS vol 6113 2010 pp 267–274  T  Calders B Goethals and S  Jarosze wicz Mining rankcorrelated sets of numerical attributes in KDD 06 Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data mining  2006 pp 96–105  A Laurent M.-J Lesot and M Rifqi Graank Exploiting rank correlations for extracting gradual dependencies in Proc of FQAS'09  2009  M K endall and B Babi ngton Smith The problem of m rankings The annals of mathematical statistics  vol 10 no 3 pp 275–287 1939  C Lucchese S Orlando and R Pere go P arallel mining of frequent closed patterns Harnessing modern computer architectures in ICDM  2007 pp 242–251  T  Uno T  Asai Y  Uchida and H Arimura  An ef 002cient algorithm for enumerating closed patterns in transaction databases in Discovery Science  2004 pp 16–31  D Gelernter  Multiple tuple spaces in linda  in PARLE 2  1989 pp 20–27

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
