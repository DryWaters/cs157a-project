Bureau. \(Project No. 06GGYB 801GX-032  AbstractIn mobile computing there are many spatial data correlative with locations, which are very important for mobile intelligent system to extract spatial association among locations that can provide potential and useful information for mobile clients. Hence, aiming to simple transverse association describing spatial association among different spatial objects under the same pattern of association, this paper proposes an approach of extracting spatial association rules based on binary mining algorithm, which firstly uses the method of Circle contained by spatial analysis to extract the values of spatial predicate based on the definitive spatial predicate, specific objective and other given objects around the objective, and then aiming to each objective transforms them into digital transaction database by binary finally extracts these spatial association rules from the spatial database with binary mining algorithm introduced by this paper In mobile computing the mining algorithm uses the method of increasing value to generate candidate frequent item sets and uses binary logical çandé operation to calculate support of item sets in order to reduce running time of mobile intelligent system, which can fast respond to requirement of client. The experiment indicates that efficiency of binary mining algorithm is faster and more efficient than Apriori used in mobile intelligent system I  I NTRODUCTION  Spatial data mining [1  m ain l y ex tr a ct la t e n t an d u s ef u l  knowledge, spatial association and pattern from spatial database. Mining spatial association rules is a key task of spatial data mining. Now the research work mainly focuses on solving two types of spatial association, which include lengthways and transverse spatial association. Lengthways spatial association is among these attributes of homogeneous objects under the same pattern of spatial association  transverse spatial association is among both these different objects under the same pattern and these different objects under the diversiform patterns. Spatial data mining need compute all kinds of spatial association among many spatial objects, and so intelligent mining system must spend too time and space at the time of mining spatial association rules, it leads to debasing the efficiency of system. Hence, aiming to some intelligent systems in mobile computing, this paper propose an approach of extracting spatial association rules based on binary, which simply consider a kind of spatial environment, namely one of transverse spatial associations is among these different objects under the same pattern of spatial association, which contains close_to that is a definitive spatial predicate, hotel that is regarded as objective, and other spatial objects including mall, traffic-service, restaurant and etc Because it is very necessary for mobile clients to know what is around the hotel and how will they inn, and so it is important for people to extract latent associations among these different locations around these hotels. For example, before some mobile clients want to stay in a hotel when getting a strange city, if they want to fast know whether here are mall and ATM nearby the hotel, at the time they will gain this information by submitting some demand to corresponding mobile device. And so, this paper presents an approach based on binary mining algorithm, which is able to fast extract the spatial association rules and betimes provide some useful information for mobile clients II  E XTRACTING THE VALUE OF SPATIAL PREDICATE  Traditional assoc iation rules mi n e s o me c o rr e l a tiv e  characteristic among item sets. In the same way, spatial association rules also extract some associations among different objects from spatial database. Spatial association rule is expressed as AB[s%, c  w h e r e A  an d B ar e s e t s o f  predicate, which describes either spatial association or nonspatial association, at least, one of them must be a spatial association, let s% be a support of spatial association rules, let c% be a confidence of spatial association rules. Here is an example about spatial association rules: is_a \(X, school  close_to \(X, bookshop\lose_to \(X, restaurant\[s%, c  All kinds of spatial predicates may generate spatial association rules, such as expressing spatial predicates of topology association: equal\(x, y\, disjoint\(x, y\, touch\(x, y overlap\(x, y\, cover\(x, y\, contain\(x, y\, coveredby\(x, y inside\(x, y\ and so on, expressing spatial predicates of distance association: very_close\(x, y\, close_to\(x, y\, commensurate\(x y\,  far_way\(x, y\, very_fay\(x, y\ and expressing spatial predicates of orientation assoc iation: east_of\(x y\, north_of\(x y\, south_of\(x, y\, west_of\(x, y\, is_same\(x, y\ and etc However, general spatial association rules mining algorithms need compute diversiform spatial associations among all spatial objects, and mining system need spend tremendous cost And so this paper simply consider a kind of requirement in 978-1-4244-2184-8/08/$25.00 © 2008 IEEE 1571 Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation June 20 -23, 2008, Zhangjiajie, China 


mobile computing, where the most important hotel for mobile clients is regarded as objective, the other objects, including mall, traffic-service, casino, hospital, restaurant and bank ATM\, are regarded as especial objects related to objective close_to expressing distance association, is defined as definitive spatial predicate used by extraction of spatial association rules. This paper regards hotel and the other special objects as spatial point-entity in database, and uses the method of Circle to create point-buffer which regards hotel as centre let r be radii of chosen buffer. There are two ways to choose the value of radii, one is that server may choose it according to mobile circumstance, although we may save time through the way, it didnêt make each mobile clients gain the most satisfaction, the other is that mobile clients may give it out when they put in task. Database used in this paper adopts vector structure, and only uses point-entity. Each of pointentity also has coordinates of position in database Process of Circle extracting is expressed as follows Step 1: Letês search the entire point-entity expressing a kind of hotel from spatial database, let \(x i o, y i o\ be their coordinates and let T i be hotel regarded as definitive objective Step 2: Let r be radii of buffer, and make hotel be the centre of a circle to create each buffer, expression is defined as follows x-x i o 2 y-y i o 2  r 2 1 Step 3: Let close_to be a spatial predicate, the objects including restaurant, traffic-service, casino, hospital, mall bank \(ATM\ and etc., are regarded as especial objects expressed as O j  j 1 m If above these objectsê coordinates expressed as \(x, y\ satisfy \(1\, these objects and corresponding hotel will form the value of spatial predicate expressed as close_to T i  O j  All the values of spatial predicate are extracted from spatial database existing in some domain based on the definitive objective \(hotel\ and the special relative objects \(mall, trafficservice, casino, hospital, bank, restaurant and etc\, these values of spatial predicate may be expressed as close_to T i  O j  For example: close_to \(hotel 1 restaurant\, close_to \(hotel 2  mall\, close_to \(hotel 3 bank\ and so on III  F ORMING TRANSACTION DATABASE  Transaction database is made up of transaction identifier  TID and corresponding transaction-items ID We regard different hotels as transaction identifier TID atabase, the values of spatial predicate related to hotel is regarded as sets of transaction-items ID with transaction identifier TID which is expressed as close_to T i  O j Let O j express entity as follows O 1 mall O 2 traffic-service O 3 casino O 4 bank O 5 restaurant O 6 hospital  And so we may get transaction database expressed as table I then all close_to T i  O j are regarded as close_to T  O j let T express all the hotels, then we change close_to T  O j nto normal transaction-items I j  TABLE I T RANSACTION DATABASE  TID List of items ID  T 1 close_to T 1  O 1 close_to T 1  O 2  T 2 close_to T 2  O 2 close_to T 2  O 3   T n close_to T n  O 4 close_to T n  O 6  Suppose transaction database have n transactions, and there are m transaction-items m  n  T i is turned into TI i so normal transaction database is expressed as table II according to table I TABLE II N ORMAL TRANSACTION DATABASE  TID List of items ID  TI 1 I 1  I 2  TI 2 I 2  I 3   TI n  I 4  I 6   IV  T HE ALGORITHM OF ASSOCIATION RULES MINING BASED ON BINARY  Let I  i 1  i 2  i m be a set of items, if i k  i k  I let T   i 1  i 2    i m  T k   I be a subset of items, named a Transactions. For example, let T k  i 1  i 2  i 3 be a subset of items, called a transaction. And then let D  T 1  T 2  T n let T k  I  k 1 n be a set of transactions, called Transaction Database TD  A  Definitions and Theorems As above hypothesis, correlative definitions and theorems are proposed as follows Definition 1 Binary Transaction BT a transaction is expressed as binary, binary transaction of transaction T is expressed as BT  b 1  b 2  b m  b k  0  k 1 m  If i k  T i and then b k 1, otherwise b k 0, the order of binary digits is as same as items which have been fixed Example, Let I 1,2,3,4,5} be a set of items, if a transaction is expressed as T i 2,3,5}, and then BT i 01101 Definition 2 Digital Transaction DT which is the integer the value of which would be obtained by turning binary of transaction into algorism Example, If BT 01101, and then DT 13 Definition 3 Relation of digital transaction accord with relation of transaction set Example, Let DT 1 be digital transaction of transaction T 1  Let DT 2 be digital transaction of transaction T 2 If T 1  T 2 and then DT 1  DT 2  Definition 4 Frequent Digital Transaction FDT which is a digital transaction, the support of which excess minimal support given by users 1572 


Definition 5 Candidate Digital Transaction Section CDTS  which is an integral section from 3 to max, each power of 2 does not belong to CDTS  Max BT i1  BT i2    BT jk each BT only expresses a kind of item, their support excess minimal support given Min=3, which is regarded as initialization because 3 is the least digital transaction expressing dualistic association Example, If support of BT j  j 1É4\ excess minimal support BT 1 01000 BT 2 00100 BT 3 00010 BT 4 00001 max BT 1  BT 2  BT 3  BT 3 15, and selective digital transaction section is expressed as CDTS 3, 15   Theorem 1 The given binary transaction uniquely corresponds to a digital transaction, vice versa Theorem 2 Let p and q be binary transactions with m bits let T p be transaction about p let T q be transaction about q then T p  T q  p and q  p  Proof suppose digit 1 locates each bit of binary p from i 1 to i k  k  m digit 0 locates other ones. If p and q  p then digit 1 locates each bit of binary q from i 1 to i k  k  m otherwise these bits must occur digit 0 with logic çandé operation\, other ones will be either 0 or 1, so T p  T q according to definition 1  And then via the hypothesis about p as before, since T p  T q  then digit 1 must locate each bits of binary q from i 1 to i k  k  m  otherwise  i k so i k  T p  i k    T q the conclusion is contrary to premises as T p  T q other ones will be either 0 or 1, so p  and q  p  Via theorems as before, two deduced conclusions are expressed as follows Conclusion 1 Let p and q be binary transactions with m bits let DT p be digital transaction about p let DT q be digital transaction about q If p and q  p and then DT p  DT q  Conclusion 2 Let p and q be binary transactions with m bits let T p be transaction about p let DT p be digital transaction about p let T q be transaction about q let DT q be digital transaction about q If DT p  DT q then T q  012  T p  Theorem 3 Let p and q be binary transactions with m bits let T p be transaction about p let T q be transaction about q let F  be frequent item sets. If p and q  p and T q  F then T p  F  Proof since p and q  p via theorem 2 then T p  T q and T q  F based on set theory, then T p  F  B  The Process of Association Rules Mining Based on Binary Firstly, we define some signs as follows DB  DB is used to save digital transaction D data-domain of D contain çvalueé and çcounté, çvalueé is used to save digital transaction and çcounté is used to save the number of same digital transaction FDT data-domain of FDT contains çvalueé and çcount valueé is used to save digital transaction and çcounté is used to save support of digital transaction, which excess minimal support given by users NFDT data-domain of NFDT only contains çvalueé to save digital transaction, the support of which is under minimal support given, and then go on doing Step 1: Data Transformations. Transaction would be transformed into digital transaction from traditional database to DB via definition 1 and 2 and then digital transactions would be saved in D on descending by digital transaction Step 2: Creating candidate digital transaction section CDTS  Frequent digital transactions gained by scanning D are used to create CDTS via definition 5 which only express a kind of item Step 3: Forming sets of Frequent Digital Transaction FDT  All frequent digital transactions are searched from CDTS to save in FDT  Step 4: Creating Digital Association Rules. Digital association rules are created from FDT when their confidence excess given min-confidence C  The Algorithm of Association Rules Mining Let [3, max b e a CDTS and there are N digital transactions saved in D on descending by digital transaction, where data arenêt repeated, and the algorithm which generates digital association rules after search frequent digital transaction, is expressed as follows 1\ While DT  3, ma 2\     If \(all NFDT j  012 DT  3\     While DT  D i value i  N  4\       If DT  D i.value 5\           s_count D i count 6 i computing support of DT  7\     If \(s_count N support 8\        Delete all FDT k  FDT k  DT rom FDT  9\           Write DT and s_count to FDT  10\     }//checking frequent digital transaction 11\   Else 12\    Write DT to NFDT  13 DT  14\    }//searching all frequent digital transaction 15\     For \(all DT  FDT  16 DT  FDT value 17\      s_count FDT count 18\       Create_Rules DT s_count 19\        }//generating association rules Create_Rules DT s_count 1\  While \(sub  1 DT  s u b  DT  2\     For \(all D i  D  3\       If \(sub   D i value\ c_count D i count 4 i computing support of sub 5\       If \(s_count/c_countconfidence 6\            Display sub  DT sub 7\     sub D  The Analysis of Association Rules Mining Algorithm The algorithm generates candidate frequent item sets by automatically increasing value. Length of candidate frequent digital transaction generated continually varies, but trend of variation is from few to many. For example If CDTS 3   t h e s e que n c e o f ge n e r a t i n g c a ndi d a t e  frequent item sets is expressed as follows DT 1 3, length 1 2 DT 4, length*=1. \(4 have been pruned via definition 5  DT 2 5, length 2 2 1573 


DT 3 6, length 3 2 DT 4 7, length 4 3 DT 8, length*=1. \(8 have been pruned via definition 5 DT 5 9, length 5 2 DT 6 10, length 6 2 DT 7 11, length 7 3 DT 8 12, length 8 2 DT 9 13, length 9 3 DT 10 14, length 10 3 DT 11 15, length 11 4 As before their lengths crossways vary from 2 to 4 candidate frequent item sets are easily generated. The method of the algorithm is different from the other algorithm. The algorithm uses the method of property 3 to prune redundant candidate frequent item sets. The algorithm also uses binary logical çandé operation to calculate support of item sets, and at the time it is the most key to use conclusion 2 of property 2 to reduce the number of scanned record in database. Because it is easier to create candidate frequent items, the efficiency of binary is faster than B_Apriori [17  V  P ROCESS OF GENERATING SPATIAL ASSOCIATION RULES  The process is expressed as follows Step 1: Digital association rules are transformed into binary if digital ç1é exists in some binary bits, transaction-item i j  related to each bit should exist according to definition 1 and then comprehensible association rules are expressed as  i 1  i 2  i 4  Step 2: Item i j of comprehensible association rules would be renewed into spatial predicate close_to T  O j and then the spatial association rules are expressed as follows close_to T  O 1   close_to T  O 2 close_to T  O 4  Step 3: The normal spatial association rules are expressed as follows is_a X  T   close_to X  O 1   close_to X  O 2 close_to  X  O 4 30%, 80 Let X is an objective which is hotel, so above rule is explained as follows When percent 80 of hotel are close to O 1 mall\ and O 2  traffic-service\, they are also close to O 4 bank\, there are percent 30 of data accord with the rule in transaction database VI  E XPERIMENT AND CAPABILITY OF ALGORITHM  A  Experiment about the Centre of Chengdu We use data from electronic map of China in 2006 made by LingTu Software Corporation. The hypotheses of experiment are expressed as follows Minimal support=40 Minimal confidence=80 Area: the centre of Chengdu Objective: hotel The definitive spatial predicate: close_to Radii of buffer r 2 Km The other special objects O 1 mall includes bazaar, shop and etc O 2 traffic-service includes depot and service station O 3 casino includes club and show business O 4 bank includes ATM O 5 restaurant O 6 hospital includes all dispensaries So we may gain 178 records from definitive database, and via algorithm based on binary we can extract the spatial association rule expressed as follows is_a X  T   close_to X  O 1   close_to X  O 4 close_to  X  O 6 0  w h i c h i s e x p r e s s e d a s f o l l o w s  w h e n  percent 80 of hotels are close to O 1 mall\ and O 4 bank\ they are also close to O 6 hospital\, there are percent 40 of data accord with the rule in map database of Chengdu 2006. The result of experiment is expressed as figure 1 by simulation model of system   Figure 1.

The executed time of two algorithms  According to the result of experiment, the efficiency of algorithm based on binary is faster and more efficient than Apriori, and so it made the efficiency of mobile device be improved VII  C ONCLUSIONS  It is very important for mobile clients to know the association among locations in mobile environment, but we need spend very expensive cost in mining all spatial association from spatial database. So aiming to simple predicate, the definitive objective and some especial objects around objectives, this paper proposes an approach of extracting spatial association rules based on binary mining algorithm to reduce cost of extraction, because binary mining algorithm uses binary logic operation to calculate support and confidence and uses the method of increasing value to generate candidate frequent item sets. It is helpful for mobile intelligent system to improve the efficiency of work. And then we will extend spatial objects and enhance efficiency of mining association rules in the future A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was fully supported by a grant from the S&T Foundation of Chengdu Sci.&Tech.

report a number of experimental results and study the impact of various parameters on the effectiveness of shedding filters Before presenting our findings we first describe the details of our experimental setup A Experiniental Setup To evaluate NR sifters and to showcase their resiliency to skewness in both query and data distributions we designed a flexible workload generator It uses the concept of hot-spot regions anid models skewness at two levels global anid local We create a number of hot-spot regions such that the data and queries are located within these hot-spots We use a global skewness parameter denoted by G to vary the size of these host spot regions Assuming that the data space is normalized to 0,11]n hot-spots are assigned rando'm side lengths for each dimension from the range G-1 00.5 1 These regions are centered at random positions within the data space By changin GC one can model sparse cases where most of the data space is not used as well as dense cases where all of the data space is utilized Within each hot spot region data and queries follow one of two distributions namely a uniform distribution UNIF in short or a skewed distribution based on multi-dimensional normals SKEW in short In the latter case the standard deviation for each dimension is assigned randomly using the range L G 1 0.5,1 where L is the local skewness parameter The means of the multi-normals are randomly located within the hot-spot regions Data and query distributions can each be one of UNIF SKEW resulting in four different combinations We compare four partitioning algorithms namely uniform grid UGRID data equi-depth DEDP query equi-depth QEDP and QDPart algorithm using flexible partitioning FLEXP We also compare load shedding using NR sifters against random dropping The default values for various parameters are given in Table I We present a large set of experiments which study the sensitivity of NR sifters to changes in these parameters The overall QoS as formulated in Equation 2 is the main metric for most of our experiments However we also report results on construction time and filter lookup-time All experiments were performed on a 3Ghz Intel P4 processor using Java with Sun JDK 1.5 B Experimental Results We divide our experimental study into three sets of experiments The first set of experiments study the interplay of partitioning algorithms and skewness in data and query distributions The second set of experiments study the impact of number of sifter regions on all performance metrics The third set of experiments are sensitivity studies and examine the affect of sample size fairness threshold QoS parameters and query size on overall QoS 1 Partitioning and Skew The graphs in Figure 4 plot overall QoS with different partitioning methods under varying levels of local and global skewness All four combinations of data and query distributions are shown in a total of eight graphs the first four on global skew and the last four on local skew Before we discuss the results in detail we point out that it is more meaningful to examine the relative performance of the alternative approaches from these figures instead of the general trend of overall QoS as a function of skewness especially the local one This is because as the local data skewness approaches extreme values most queries get empty results even without load shedding artificially boosting the overall QoS First we look at the case where query distributions within hot-spot regions are skewed and data distributions are unriform We observe that the best overall QoS achieved by the NR sifters is 60 to 50 and 35 to 65 higher compared to random dropping along the global skewness and local skewness range respectively For this scenario the best partitioning algorithm turns out to be QDPart The closest alternative is data equi-depth partitioning The sub-optimal performance of data equi-depth partitioning can be attributed to its agnostic nature with respect to skewness in query distribution We also observe that query equi-depth partitioning performs the worst among sifter-based approaches and is only slightly better than random dropping This observation holds for all of the cases we studied This shows the importance of capturing the skewness in data distribution which is completely ignored by the query equi-depth partitioning The performance of

Query indexing is a relevant technique used in continual query systems to quickly filter out non-relevant items 13 14 Our NR sifters can be considered as summary threshold A Fig 9 Impact of fairness

effective in most scenarios Figure 6 plots the time it takes to construct a filter on the server side as a function of the number of sifter regions using different partitioning algorithms We observe that for 1  16 the construction cost which involves performing partitioning query consolidation and running the linear solver takes only about about 150 msecs for all approaches For I  50 all alternatives are still close and under  300 msecs However as 1 increases further we see a surprising trend One would expect that filters employing variable partitioning based QDPart approaches VARP in the figure will be costlier to construct Instead we see that data equi-depth partitioning takes the most amount of time with a construction time of 2.7 secs for 1  100 This shows that it is the linear solver that dominates the construction time Clearly it takes more time to configure the data equi-depth filter Note that for the SKEW/UNIF case the default from Table I data equi-depth partitioning performs the best As a result the additional time spent on configuration is put to good use and yields a better overall QoS value Figure 7 studies the impact of number of sifter regions on the lookup time another important performance metric It plots the number of times the lookup operation can be performed within a second This includes the decision to drop or forward a data item which we consider as part of the lookup 1 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 9 fairness 0  10 A 0~1 per second 3 Other Sensitivity Studies Figure 8 plots the overall QoS  30 z=0.9 E 20 0.01 0.0 qu Fig 10 ImI Z=0.1 40 z_05 E  z=0.7 process Figure 7 shows that the number of times the lookup can be performed by equi-depth partitioning based filters only decreases by 27 going from I  16 to I  100 whereas this number is 40 for QDPart based flexible partitioning Yet even for I  100 the latter can imake around 5 million lookups as a function of the throttler for various data and query distributions We see that except for the UNIF/UNIF case the improvement in overall QoS per unit increase in the throttler value is more profound for the heavy load shedding scenarios This shows that NR sifters are very effective when a significant portion of the load has to be shed In agreement with our insight from Section VI-B 1 the UNIF/UNIF case which is an example of the broader case of proportionally distributed queries and data does not benefit from the use of sifters and follows a linear trend This suggests emulation of random dropping behavior Figure 9 plots the improvement in the overall QoS relative to random dropping as a function of the fairness threshold A and for different throttler values In general the higher the fairness threshold the more flexibility we have in setting the drop thresholds thus higher overall QoS at the expense of fairness among queries We observe that this trend is more pronounced for the high load shedding scenarios For instance when we have z  0.3 the relative improvement raises from 5 to 40 while increasing A from 0.1 to 0.9 On the other hand it stays almost flat for the case of z  0.9 Note that the case of z  0.1 is defected since all drop thresholds except one reach to 1 after certain stage and further increase in the fairness threshold does not bring any improvement Figure 10 plots the improvement in the overall QoS relative to random dropping as a function of the query side lengths and for different throttler values When the range queries have increasing volumes more data items match the query regions Thus the same fraction of the dropped stream have increasingly negative impact on the overall QoS Figure 10 shows that the NR sifters provide slightly increased relative improvement over the random dropping as the query volumes get larger only around 15 for the excessive load shedding scenario of z  0 1 However the figure does not plot the unrealistically extreme cases For instance if all queries have the size of the hot spot regions then sifters would obviously not provide any improvement over random dropping VII RELATED WORK Load shedding in stream processing has been an important topic since the inception of DSMSs 17 Previous works in this area have so far focused on either load shedding on operator graphs 10 or specific stream operators such as aggregations 18 19 and joins 20 21 When shedding load in operator graphs moving random drop filters as close to the input streams as possible was established as an effective technique However load-shedding source filters that go beyond random dropping such as NR sifters have not been considered in the past NR sifters their fast construction and optimal configuration are all new problems addressed by this paper Another related research is publish/subscribe exemplified by Gryphon 22 SemCast 23 and Siena 24 Pushing query subscription predicates close to the data sources publishers is a commonly applied paradigm in publish/subscribe systems for reducing the processing load as well as the overall bandwidth consumption However the filtering performed in these systems do not impact the completeness of the query results In other words filters are employed to drop nonrelevant data items that do not impact the query results Yet such filters cannot drop data items of lesser but non-zero value query indexes with a significant distinction a data item is filtered out probabilistically by an NR sifter Their summary nature and use of non-uniformly regulated drop probabilities lend itself to compact and effective load shedding source filters 404 50 


which can optimize query result quality under varying levels of load shedding dictated by dynamic stream rates without incuring high adaptation overhead VIII CONCLUSIONS We presented and formulated the problem of adaptive source filtering and load shedding in the context of data stream processing We introduced a novel type of source filter called non-uniformly regulated sifter which can judiciously drop parts of the data streams at the source nodes by minimally impacting the QoS of the queries installed at the C server This effectively reduces the load at the CQ server by reducing the amount of data fed into the query processor We developed concepts and techniques to quickly construct compact effective in terms of maximizing QoS and efficient in terms of lookup tiime NR sifters Fast construction of compact filters also enables frequent and low-overhead adaption to system dynamics such as aggregate source stream rate and source data distribution We presented large number of experimental results studying the behavior of NR sifters and presented a comparative study of alternative sifter construction schemes We showed that compact sifters are significantly superior to other alternatives such as random dropping especially for heavy load shedding scenarios REFERENCES 1 D Terry D Goldberg D Nichols and B Oki Continuous queries over append-only databases in ACM SIGMOD 1992 2 J Chen D J DeWitt F Tian and Y Wang Niagaracq A scalable continuous query system for internet databases in ACM SIGMOD 2000 3 L Liu C Pu and W Tang Continual queries for internet scale event-driven information delivery IEEE Transactions on Data and Knowledge Engineering TKDE July/August 1999 4 A Arasu B Babcock S Babu M Datar K Ito R Motwani I Nishizawa U Srivastava D Thomas R Varma and J Widom STREAM The stanford stream data manager IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin vol 26 2003 5 H Balakrishnan M Balazinska D Carney U Cetintemel M Cherniack C Convey E Galvez J Salz M Stonebraker N Tatbul R Tibbetts and S Zdonik Retrospective on Aurora VLDB Journal 2004 6 S Chandrasekaran 0 Cooper A Deshpande M J Franklin J M Hellerstein W Hong S Krishnamurthy S R Madden V Raman F Reiss and M A Shah TelegraphCQ Continuous dataflow processing for an uncertain world in CIDR 2003 7 Streambase systems http://www.streambase.com May 2005 8 N Jain L Amini H Andrade R King Y Park P Selo and C Venkatramani Design imrplementation and evaluation of the linear road benchmark on the stream processing core in ACM SIGMOD 2006 9 K.-L Wu P S Yu B Gedik K W Hildrum C C Aggarwal E Bouillet W Fan D A George X Gu G Luo and H Wang Challenges and experience in prototyping a multimodal stream analytic and monitoring application on System S in VLDB 2007 10 N Tatbul U Cetintemel S Zdonik M Cherniack and M Stonebraker Load shedding in a data stream manager in VLDB 2003 11 B Gedik and L Liu Quality-aware distributed data delivery for continuous query services in ACM SIGMOD 2006 12 R Kuntschke B Stegmaier A Kemper and A Reiser StreamGlobe Processing and sharing data streams in grid-based p2p infrastructures in VLDB 2005 13 K.-L Wu S.-K Chen and P S Yu Query indexing with containment-encoded intervals for efficient stream processing Knowledge and Informcation Systems January 2006 14 H.-S Lim J.-G Lee M.-J Lee K.-Y Whang and I.Y Song Continuous query processing in data streams using duality of data queries in ACM SIGMOD 2006 15 B Gedik K.-L Wu and P S Yu Non-uniformly regulated sifters for adaptive load shedding in data stream processing IBM Research Tech Rep RC 24289 2007 16 B Gedik K.-L Wu P S Yu and L Liu A load shedding framework and optimizations for m-way windowed stream joins in IEEE ICDE 2007 17 D Carney U Cetintemel M Cherniack C Convey S Lee G Seidman M Stonebraker N Tatbul and S B Zdonik Monitoring streams a new class of data management applications in VLDB 2002 18 N Tatbul and S Zdonik A subset-based load shedding approach for aggregation queries over data streams in VLDB 2006 19 B Babcock M Datar and R Motwani Load shedding for aggregation queries over data streams in IEEE ICDE 2004 20 A M Ayad and J F Naughton Static optimization of conjunctive queries with sliding windows over infinite streams in ACM SIGMOD 2004 21 B Gedik K.-L Wu P S Yu and L Liu Adaptive load shedding for windowed stream joins in ACM CIKM 2005 22 G Banavar T D Chandra B Mukherjee J Nagarajarao R F Strom  and D C Sturman An efficient multicast protocol for content-based publish-subscribe systems in IEEE ICDCS 1999 23 0 Papaemmanouil and U Cetintemel SemCast Se mantic multicast for content-based data dissemination in IEEE ICDEr 2005 24 A Carzaniga D S Rosenblum and A L Wolf Design and evaluation of a wide-area event notification service vol 19 no 3 200 1 405

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
