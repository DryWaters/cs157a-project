Abstract  Data mining is the process of extracting hidden patterns from data. With the explosion of data at a tremendous rate, data mining is essential to extract useful information Association rule mining is a method of finding correlation relationships among large set of data items. A rule is characterized as sensitive if its disclosure risk is above a certain confidence value. Sensitive rules should not be disclosed to the public, as they can be used to infer sensitive data and provide an advantage for the business competitors. Techniques for hiding association rules are limited to binary items. But, real world data consists of quantitative values. In this paper, a method to hide fuzzy association rule is proposed, in which, the fuzzified data is mined using modified apriori algorithm in order to extract rules and identify sensitive rules. The sensitive rules are hidden by decreasing the support value of Right Hand Side \(RHS\ of the rule. A framework for automated generation of membership function is also proposed. Experimental results of the proposed approach demonstrate efficient information hiding with minimum side effects Keywords Ñ Association Rules; Data Mining; Fuzzy Logic Sensitive Rule; membership function I INTRODUCTION Data mining is the process of extracting useful knowledge from large databases. However, data mining also poses a threat to privacy and information protection if not used properly. Association rule analysis is a popular tool for discovering associations among large amount of data. Useful hidden information could be easily exposed using this kind of tool. Information privacy is essential to prevent private data from being available to others. Once private data is released, it will be impossible to prevent misuse h eref ore, th e protection of sensitive hidden information has become a critical issue to be resolved Privacy preserving data mining which involves getting valid data mining results in addition to hiding sensitive information has been receiving attention in the research community. Consider the case of a health drink reseller who purchase health drink at low price from two companies Horlicks and Complan. Reseller also grants the companies access to his customer database. Complan supplier may misuse the database to mine association rules related to the Horlicks, inferring facts like çPeople who buy Milk also buy Horlicksé. Using this information Complan supplier offers a discount coupon on milk on purchase of Complan. Hence sales on Horlicks drops steeply and Horlicks supplier will not be able to offer his promised discounts. This enables Complan to monopolize the health drink market which results in the hike of health drink prices. As a result, reseller may start losing his business. This scenario emphasis need for research on hiding sensitive knowledge Techniques of hiding association rules can be classified into two broad categories di s t ort i o n ba s e d t echn i q u e a n d blocking based technique. In distortion based technique, the data is distorted such that the support and confidence of sensitive association rules is reduced below threshold. Here threshold refers to minimum value of support and confidence below which the association rule becomes uninteresting. This technique has side effects of èLost Rulesê and èGhost Rules Lost Rules refers to undesirable hiding of items and association rules that are not sensitive. Ghost rules are non genuine association rules which become part of association rules set. Distortion based technique reduces these side effects while maintaining a linear time complexity with dataset size This technique also poses a serious bottleneck in some specific situations like medical database where deleting a part of dataset may infer to a wrong prescription Blocking based technique is characterized by introducing uncertainty without distorting the database. It also suffers from side effects of lost item, lost rule and ghost rule Initially, rule hiding techniques proposed by Vassilios et  e re dis t ortion bas ed alg o rithm s a n d s i de ef f ect s of  these algorithms were high. Duraiswamy et cribed  an algorithm called Sensitive Rule Hiding. In this algorithm sensitive rules with single antecedent and consequent were clustered. Each rule is modified to reduce its confidence When all sensitive association rules are hidden, clusters are converted into a modified database. This technique shows high side effects both in terms of ghost rules as well as loss of non sensitive rules. Yuhong et al. presented FP-tree based method for inverse frequent set minin t h is a l g o rit h m after extraction and pruning of frequent itemset, FP-tree is constructed, which is later converted into many versions of modified database. The strengths of this technique is its efficiency and availability of multiple versions of  modified database. Number of released databases was characterized by the number of non frequent items chosen. This technique is focused on hiding sensitive items only. Further, it has the side effect of large number of lost rules.

All transactions in dataset are first sorted by weight in descending order. Transactions are then modified till the confidence of sensitive association rules fall below the given threshold.

Some work has been done to discover association rules from quantitative data using fuzzy set concepts. But, only limited research papers are available in the field of hiding fuzzy association rule in quantitative data. Hiding quantitative rule can be done by increasing the support of Left Hand Side LHS\ the rule which in turn decreases the confidence of the ru Fuzzification of support and confidence framework with variable number of fuzzy membership function and decreasing the support can also be used for quantitative association rule hiding w e v e r both th e approach es requ ire th e membership function to be predefined and are usually built by human experts. In absence of expertise, the membership functions cannot be accurately defined which reduces system performan This paper proposes a learning method to derive membership functions automatically. Further the paper also presents a method for preventing extraction of useful association rules from quantitative data by decreasing the support of the rule. The support of a rule A B is decreased by decreasing the support count of itemset AB which is achieved by decreasing the support value of B on Right hand Side\(RHS\ the rule. This is done until either support or confidence value of the rule goes below minimum support or minimum confidence value respectively The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Privacy preserving fuzzy association rule hiding in quantitative data is described in Section II. Approach to derive membership function automatically is detailed in section III. The method to hide useful fuzzy association rules is described in Section IV Experimental results are given in Section V II PROBLEM STATEMENT An association rule is defined as an implication X Y where both X and Y are defined as sets of attributes interchangeably called items X is called as the body LHS\ the rule and Y is called as the head RHS\ the rule. It is interpreted as follows: çfor a specified fraction of the existing transactions, a particular value of an attribute set X determines the value of attribute set Y as another particular value under a certain confidenceé. For instance, an association rule in a supermarket basket data may be stated as, çIn  20 of the transactions, 75% of the people buying butter also buy milk in the same transactioné; 20% and 75% represent the support and the confidence, respectively. The significance of an association rule is measured by its support and confidence Support is the percentage of transactions that contain both X and Y and confidence is the ratio of the support of X U Y to the support of X  Let I  i 1 i 2 i 3  be the complete item set where each i j 1  j  m  is a quantitative attribute. Given a database D  t 1 t 2 t n  where each t j is a  transaction with attributes I and the fuzzy sets associated with attributes in I our goal is to find out some interesting useful association rules Let X  x 1 x 2 x p  and Y  y 1 y 2 y q  be two large itemsets. Then, the fuzzy association rule is given as follows A  B where A  f 1 f 2 f p  and B  g 1 g 2 g q  and f i  the fuzzy regions related to attribute x i  g j  the fuzzy regions related to attribute y j  X and Y are subsets of I and are disjoint. A and B contain the fuzzy sets associated with the corresponding attributes in X an  In a classical set or crisp set, the objects in a set are called elements or members of the set. An element x belonging to a set A is defined as x  A A characteristic function or membership function  A  x defined as an element in the universe U having a crisp value of 1 or 0. For every x  U The membership functions for crisp set can take a value of 1or 0, the membership functions for fuzzy sets can take values in the interv T h e ran g e bet w een 0 an d 1 is ref erred  to as the membership grade or degree of membership.

The data are clustered into classes. Membership functions are then generated from these class  T h e alg orithm is  detailed as follows Step 1 Consider a data set with n transactions. If the domain of all attributes is same and has limited values then for each transaction the values of all attributes are averaged and the transactions are sorted in ascending order of the average value else go to step 2 Step 2 The difference  between adjacent values of a particular attribute in all transactions in the sorted data is determined. The difference as shown in equation \(1\ill provide a way to calculate the similarity between adjacent values The difference for a set of transactions  is for i=\(1,2,3, n-1\          \(1 Where y i and y i+1 are adjacent values in the sorted data Step 3 The similarities between adjacent values are determined using equation \(2\d are mapped into real numbers between 0 and 1     2 Where diff i is the difference between adjacent data  s is the standard deviation of diff i and C is the control parameter and is used to determine the shape of the membership function Step 4 The data is then grouped according to similarities A threshold value  divides adjacent values into classes. The number of classes determines the number of membership i i i y y diff    1     otherwise 0   for  1 s i s i i C diff C diff s       A for 0 A for 1 x x x A       1  0       x A x x x A A A   2011 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies 149 


functions. If the similarity \(s i greater than the threshold value, then the two adjacent values belong to the same class otherwise the values are divided into different classes as represented in equation \(3  3 where C i and C i+1 denote two distinct classes for the same input or output parameter Step 5 Membership Function is defined for each class One of the simplest membership functions is the triangular membership function, and is used for the remainder of the equations. Triangular membership function for class j consists of three points, the central vertex point, b j and the two endpoints, a j and c j as shown in fig. 1 Figure 1. Triangular membership function The central vertex point for each class is determined using the formula        4 Where j represents the j th class, y min represents the first data index for this class, i.e., data y i through y k fall into class j, and y max represents the ending data index within that class The left and right endpoints of the membership function, aj and cj, are obtained using equation \(5\d \(6     5       6 Where is the threshold value IV ALGORITHM FOR HIDING SENSITIVE FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES In a quantitative database, if a critical rule X Y needs to be hidden, its confidence value is decreased to a value smaller than the minimum confidence value. One way of decreasing confidence value is decreasing the support value of an item Y at RHS, and the other way is increasing the support value of item X at LHS Our approach decreases confidence value of a rule, by decreasing the support value of RHS item. If the value of item in RHS  is greater than 0.5 and value of item in LHS then its value is subtracted from 1. Abbreviations used in the proposed algorithm are given as follows D  Initial database with n transaction data  C  Cleaned database with n transaction data  F  Fuzzified database X  A set of predicting items TL Transactions belong to a LHS item TR Transactions belong to a RHS item U Rule Rh sensitive rule Input 1\ource database D 2\imum support value \(min_support 3\imum confidence value \(min_confidence Output A transformed database Dê so that useful fuzzy association rules cannot be mined Algorithm DSR 1.

The fuzzified data is shown in table 3        8 Where a  is the left end of the triangle, b is the peak of the triangle and c is the right end of the triangle \(values are the corresponding x axis values Fig 2. Triangular Membership Function used Step 3 Calculate the support count of each attribute region R on the transactions data by summing up the fuzzy values of all the transactions in the fuzzified transaction data as in table 3 Step 4 Check whether count of each attribute is greater than or equal to the predefined minimum support value. If an attribute satisfies the above condition, put it in the set of large2 itemsets \(L2 Consider the minimum support is set to 2.3 and minimum confidence to 70%. The regions Bz, Co and Dz are have their support value greater than minimum support, so are considered in forming the rules and finding the corresponding confidence value. The rules  can  be   Bz Co Co Dz, Bz Dz, Co Bz, Dz Co, Dz Bz. Consider Bz Co is a critical rule to be hidden and the support of the rule is calculated as shown in table 4 Step 5 For each large 2 itemsets, based on user specified minimum confidence value, rules are extracted. Confidence value of  A B rule is computed as follows    The confidence value is calculated for the rule Bz Co    Step 6 To hide a critical rule, its confidence value is decreased by decreasing support\(AB\ order to hide the rule Bz Co, the  support \(BzCo\ reduced by subtracting the transaction value of Co from 1 when the value of Co is greater than 0.5 and corresponding Bzês value. Using this procedure the support values of transaction T3 and T4 are reduced as shown in table 5 Now the confidence is    As the confidence is still greater than minimum confidence, in those transactions that have Bz and Co value as 1, Co is replaced with 0 as shown in T2 of table 6. The confidence value after the modification is calculated as    As the confidence value is less than the predefined confidence value the rule Bz Co is hided.  The modified values replace the original fuzzified values in the fuzzification table as shown in table 7. Defuzzification using centroid method is done on the modified values to get back quantitative values using the equation \(9 Table 4.

Unlike previous approaches which mainly deals with association rules in binary database, our approach deals with hiding the association rules in quantitative database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is more efficient as it facilitates better rule hiding and  minimizes the number of lost rules and ghost rules. Also, this approach makes minimum modification of data. To further minimize the side effect and modification to database genetic algorithm can be used REFERENCES 1 T Be rbe rog lu a n d M Ka y a  H iding F u z z y  A s soc ia tion R u le s in Quantitative Data  The 3rd InternationalConference on Grid and Pervasive Computing Workshops, May 2008, pp. 387392 2 M a noj G upta a nd R  C  J o s h i  P r i v a cy P r e s e r v i ng Fuz zy  Association Rules in in Quantitative Dataé, International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering, Vol. 1, No. 4 October, 2009, 382-388 3 V a ssilios S V e ry k i os, A  K.

In order to notice the differences, all grayed cells are pruned thanks to the RSA education wage [6;7] [8;9] [10;13] [14;18 2.85; 4.70] 3 4 15 -22 4.75; 7.14] 1 3 8 -12 7.30; 12.67] -2 -3 1 5 13.00; 26.29] -1 -4 -25 30 TABLE VII ENHANCED CONTINGENCY TABLE OF VARIATIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATION \(EDUCATION-WAGE This table is the starting point of the consolidation process described below 39 


V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables
