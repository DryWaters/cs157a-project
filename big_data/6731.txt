 The Utility Frequent Pattern Mining Based on Slide Window in Data Stream  Feng-gang Li, Ying-jia Sun, Zhi-wei Ni, Yu Liang, Xue-ming Mao Key Laboratory of Process Optimization and Intelligent Decision-making, Ministry of Education Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, 230009, China E-mail lifecan@sina.com   Abstract In traditional study of mining data stream, each item in the data stream is of equal importance. However, in 
practice, each item has a different significance, which is known as utility. This paper combines frequent mining item sets with utility and proposes an efficient algorithm for utility frequent pattern mining \(UFPM\. It combines bitmap with tree structure that can store and update the pattern of data stream quickly and completely by scanning only once The algorithm generated by lexicographic order, proposes a novel tree U-tree and makes convenience for pattern updating and user reading. With a pattern growth approach in mining, the algorithm can effectively avoid the problem of 
a mass candidacy generation by level-wise searching. The experiments results show that our algorithm which is in high efficiency and good scalability outperforms the existing analogous algorithm  Keywords-utility frequent pattern mining; slide window data stream; data mining   002  I NTRODUCTION  In recently years, the development of hardware technology accelerates the ability in data gathering and the focusing aspects in data mining are gradually turning 
from static data sets mining into dynamic data stream mining. Which is different from traditional static data base, data stream has the characteristic  of once access continuity, rapidity and unlimited increase. Therefore, the mining algorithm used in static data base usually canêt be applied to data stream mining In the field of data mining and knowledge discovery frequent itemsets play an important role, but it equally treats each item without considering the itemês real importance that is çutility 2 However, in real world each different item has a significant difference in the 
importance of transaction or pattern. Pure frequent itemsets mining based on supporting ability cannot meet the criterion in real world. Thus, people give each item a different value to represent its importance and then start data mining. This thought is called utility pattern mining compared with frequent pattern mining At present, the research of utility pattern mining in data stream is rather unfocuse ts  the algorithm of high utility itemsets mining in data streamÑTHUI-Mine. Reference [4 wo  algorithms of MHUI-BIT and MHUI-TID, but the weakness is that it causes mass candidacy frequent 
itemsets and complicates the checking process, which influences the function greatly. Re poses the algorithm of GUIDE, which can mine out the maximal temporary utility sets by only once scanning but cannot well process sequential and large scale data stream This paper puts the UFPM \(utility frequent pattern mining\window. This algorithm is in overall consideration of the itemês count and self-utility and also combines the two perfectly that can get the pattern which meets the demand of utility frequency in the data stream by scanning the data for only once. Using 
the structure of bitmap to store the information of data stream can save the time and the storing consumption of data stream. The algorithm which uses pattern increasing mining can avoid the problem of a mass candidacy generation by level-wise searching in the existing algorithm. The experiments results show that the algorithm which is in high efficiency and good scalability outperforms the existing analogous algorithm  003 S OME P RELIMINARIES  
Suppose a data stream DS={T 1 T 2 T k among which T i is the ith transaction in a series of sequential transactions. T={tid,x 1 x 2 x n is itemsets, among which x n is its item, n is the size of the transaction and each transaction has its special transaction id. The set of the

 itemsets is called pattern X, and each pattern X is a subset of data set A. If a transaction T includes all the data elements in pattern X, that is T 002 X, and then we call this transaction embodies the pattern X. Specific to data stream DS, make it to sections. Each section includes the same number of transaction and this kind of section is called a basic window, noted as W. The transaction  number included in basic window is called the size of basic window and is noted as |W|. The slide window SW is composed with a series of sequential basic windows and we note it as <W1,W2...,Wn>. The number of basic windows in the slide window is called the size of slide window and we note it as |SW|. As is conveyed above each item in data stream has its independent importance that is utility, and we note as u\(xi Definition 1  Supporting  number and supporting ability the number of transactions which includes X in window W is called the supporting number of X in W and notes it as count\(X\percent of Xês transaction number in W is called Xês  supporting ability and we note it as sup\(X\we can get that  sup\(X\=count\(X\/|W  among which |W| is the width of W or the total number of transactions in W TID 1 2 3 4 5 Transaction cba d cea ceb dcf Table 1.

Utility frequency Given a minimal utility frequency as minus. If the utility of pattern X is bigger than or equal to minus, that is us\(X\minus, then it can be infer that pattern X is utility frequent. What the so-called utility frequent pattern mining is to find out all the patterns which meet this formula Definition 4. The transaction utility support of pattern X The sum of transaction utility supports which include all the transactions in pattern X   In frequent itemsets mining, çdownward closure propertyé is usually used to reduce the non-frequent patterns. The so-called çdownward closure property means that, if one pattern is frequent, then its sub-patterns are all frequent. On the contrary, if a pattern is not frequent, its super-patterns are not frequent  However because utility is considered as a factor in the utility frequent pattern mining, this property cannot be used directly. We define the transaction utility supporting number of pattern X as   k q XT SW tus X tu T 002\003  002  Definition 5. Transaction utility frequency If the transaction utility supporting number of one pattern X is all bigger than or equal to minus, that is   minus tus X 004  then we take that X is transaction utility frequent and we also call it as frequent itemsets     002 UFPM  A LGORITHM  Considering the unlimited increasing and quickly characteristics of data stream, the storage of data should be space saving and easily updating. This paper uses the structure of bitmap to represent the information of data stream. By computing the bit, we can easily and quickly get the patternês supporting number. At the same time according to the utility frequent pattern information U-tree from the record window computed from the structure of traditional FP-tree, then updates it by increment and finally uses UFPM algorithm to process frequent itemsets mining for the data in the window A  Bitmap structure Bitmap structure refers to using the binary bit to represent the condition of itemsets in the window. If one of itemsets appears in the transaction, then its corresponding sit is 1, or else is 0. According to logic operation OR, we can quickly get the supporting number of the itemsets. Also we can store the data by scanning the data stream for only once  In the following example of data stream, we make

 the size of the slide windowês basic window as 1, the slide window as 4, and then the bitmap information of the first slide window can be shown in table 3  Item T1 T2 T3 T4 a 1 0 1 0 b 1 1 0 1 c 1 0 1 1 d 0 1 0 0 e 0 0 1 1 f 0 0 0 0 Table 3. The bitmap information of the first window  B  Data processing in the slide window  When the window is not full, each new transaction enters the window one by one and the front transaction takes over its front transaction till the number of transactions is equal to the size of the window and that is the start of the window sliding. In the process of sliding we use the method of making the new transaction take over the transaction which is about to leave the window to distinguish the method of under fill window to update the data. By using this new method, we can decrease the data move for \(|SW|-1\mes in each slide. If the slide window is very big, then we can save much more time According to this idea, the information of the second slide window bitmap can be shown in table 4  Table 4. The bitmap information of the second window C  U-tree structure In order to meet the demand of high utility frequent pattern in mining the slide window, this paper designs an algorithm for utility frequent pattern mining. When the window is sliding, it first creates its corresponding bitmap information, then according to the definition of utility support, we compute the utility supporting number of each pattern and do the pruning by the given minimal utility frequent value minus so we can get the corresponding sub-window utility frequent tree which we name it the U-tree. The node of the tree includes 5 data regions: the name of the node is node-name, the nodeês first transaction is named as tid, the nodeês transaction utility supporting number is node-tus, its parent node is node-parent, and its brother node is node-brnode However, the node-tus has a little difference with tus\(x defined in definition 4. Node-tus represents the sum of the transaction utility supporting number that traverses the tree nodes Data processing of the slide window and the algorithm of the sub-window slide tree are shown as follows Algorithm 1 Data storage, update, and window sliding tree creation Input: data stream, slide window size |SW| and the minimal utility frequent value minus Output: bitmap information, sub-window utility frequent tree U-tree obtained by pruning 1  Initialize the slide window, U-tree 2  if\(tid<|SW for\(tid=1;tid\003|SW|;tid for\(fetch each item by lexicographic order in the transaction if item appears in this transaction set the corresponding bitmap site tid/32,tid%32> as 1 else set the bitmap site <tid/32,tid%32 as 0 compute the present utility supporting number of the item in reading 002  compute this transactionês utility supporting number tus\(X 002  add transaction ADD 002  else for\(tid;tid\003sum of all the transactions;tid for\(fetch each item by lexicographic order in the transaction if item appears in this transaction set the corresponding bitmap site tid%|SW else set the bitmap site tid%|SW calculate this transactionês utility supporting number tus\(X 002  delete the transaction DELE and Item T5 T2 T3 T4 A 0 0 1 0 B 0 1 0 1 C 1 0 1 0 D 1 1 0 0 E 0 0 1 1 F 1 1 0 0

 add transaction ADD 002  D  Delete transaction According to the idea above, when the window starts sliding, the new transaction enters the window and the old transaction is leaving, then it needs to be deleted. In the bitmap, we use the covering method. However, in the structure of U-tree, we first do the delete and then add the new transaction U-tree. At the same time, because the U-tree is built by lexicographic order, it can be easily learned that the initial transaction mark of one nodeês child nodes can not precede this node. So, when a node which its transaction information is all about to leave the window, that is the time to delete the whole node, we can delete all the child nodes which are in same with the transaction marks  Algorithm 2: Delete old U-tree   Input: U-tree, tid, the size of window |SW Output: Delete the old U-tree DEL\(U-tree,transaction number tid, window size SW for each node in U-tree// start traversing from the root if\(p.node-tid\003tid 003 SW|\// decide if the node belongs to the leaving window transaction if\(\(p.tus\(p 003 tu\(T p.node-tid 0\ut if the node has follow-up transaction p 003 tu\(T p.node-tid  the nodeês transaction supporting number p.node-tid=follow-up transaction node node-tid update the nodeês first transaction marks  else{delete this node and its child nodes which is in same with this nodeês initial transaction marks end the traverse else end traverse of this node and its child nodes, then turn into other bother-nodes\(if has no bother-nodes, turn to other non-traversed nodes E  Add transaction After deleting the old U-tree which is leaving the window, update the U-tree with the new-added transaction information. The specific algorithm is as follows Algorithm 3 :Add new U-tree ADD\(U-tree 004 tid 004 window size |SW if\(U-tree is null set up the root node of U-tree 002  else for each node in U-tree//start traversing from the root node if\(for one child node A set A.item-name=p.item-name decide if need create new node  p.tus\(p\=p.tus\(p\+tu\(T p.node-tid  else{create a new node N 002  connect the new node with its parent nodes 002  N.node-tid=tid set the new nodeês initial transaction mark with the present transaction number  N.tus\(N\=tu\(T N.node-tid he utility supporting number of the transaction Now, we give an example of how to create a U-tree. Using the data in form 3, we get the first slide window. Its U-tree is shown in figure 1        Figure 1  Figure 1. The U-tree of the first slide window Then, the window starts sliding, and the old transaction T1 should be deleted. After deleting T1, we get the U-tree shown in figure 2         Figure 2  Figure 2. After deleting the transaction T1 Finally, T5 enters into the slide window. The bitmap information changes into table 4 and the U-tree is updated, as is shown in figure 3

         Figure 3. The second slide window after adding the transaction T5  F  Utility frequent itemsets mining This unit emphasizes the description of UFPM algorithm that how to mine out the utility frequent itemsets in the data stream. UFPM algorithm follows the pattern growing mining method. First, we create each nodeês pre-tree and the creation of pre-tree is based on the creation of the previous sub-window U-tree. Second according to definition 5, delete the non-transaction utility frequent nodes in pre-trees and get the candidacy utility frequent pattern tree \(short for candidacy tree\ For all the nodes which their transaction utility supporting number is less than minus and all that is over than it can be deleted. Then, by calculating each candidacy utility frequent pattern \(short for candidacy pattern\ês utility supporting number us\(X\f it is less than the minimal utility frequent value minus. Finally, output all the utility frequent patterns Take the figure 1 for example. Suppose the minimal utility frequent value minus is 1.5. Start from the bottom and left root çcé. The pre-tree of çcé is shown in figure 4\(a\e get the candidacy pattern {a,c:1.9 004 b,c:1.6 004 c:3.5}. The following figure 4\(b Because the transaction utility supporting number made up by çaé and çeé is less than minus, çaé and çeé cannot make up any candidacy patterns. So figure 4\(b\the candidacy tree of çeé, and we get the candidacy pattern a,e:1.9 004 b,c,e:1.6 004 e:2.5}. In the same way, the candidacy pattern of çbé is {a,b:1.9 004 b:2.6}. The candidacy patterns of çceé are {b,c,e:1.6 004 c,e:1.6           Figure 4. Process of mining According to definition 5, we need to calculate the utility supporting number of each candidacy pattern by the slide windowês bitmap information and utility value table. Then find the utility frequent pattern from it. For the example above, The final utility frequent patterns are b,c:1.6 004 b,c,e:1.6 004 c,e:2.2  003 A NALYSIS OF THE EXPERIMENT  S RESULTS  We use C++ language to realize the UFPM algorithm. The experiment is operated on PC with OS of Windows XP, CPU of 2.93GHZ, and the Internal Storage of 2GB. This experiment chooses two classical data sets for testing: T10I4D100K and Mushroom. The former data set uses IBM data producing agent to create, and the latter is the classical density data set which is from ch  item size randomly as 0.1~0.9 utility. Set the data sets as follows  Properties Data Total items Average transaction length Window size T10I4D100K 1,000 10 10K Mushroom 120 23 10K Table 5. Basic facts of data sets  A  Experiment 1: The superiority of UFPM algorithm The UFPM algorithm in this paper compares with the THUI-Mine algorithm in  MHUI-TID algorithm in re gure 5 a n d figure 6 show the computing times of the three algorithms in data set T10I4D100K and Mushroom. Because the UFPM algorithm uses bitmap structure to store the data in data stream, and remove the influence of old U-tree by directly covering method, so it saves lots of storage space At the same time, the node of U-tree uses an initial transaction mark which records the earliest transaction that is easy for updating. However, U-tree needs to be preserved, and its complication is very high when in the condition of low minus. In a whole, the operating time of UFPM algorithm runs in a rather low level which is obviously superior to the algorithms of THUI-Mine and MHUI-TID

Set minus as 0.005, and each of the slide window\220s width is 5K, 10K, 15K, and 20K. We test the average operating time on every slide window in data set T10I4D1000K. The results are shown in figure 7. We can learn from the figure that the operating time of UFPM algorithm is in a linear increasing with the increase of window\220s width.

  This paper proposed a new method to mine out the utility frequent itemsets in data stream\204UFPM. It combines the bitmap structure and tree structure that can easily and quickly store and update data. It fetches data according to lexicographic order and it can mine out all the utility frequent patterns in data stream for only once It uses mining method by increasing pattern which can avoid the problem of a mass candidacy itemsets by level-searching in existing algorithm, so it can obviously reduce the number of candidacy itemsets and the operating time.

report a number of experimental results and study the impact of various parameters on the effectiveness of shedding filters Before presenting our findings we first describe the details of our experimental setup A Experiniental Setup To evaluate NR sifters and to showcase their resiliency to skewness in both query and data distributions we designed a flexible workload generator It uses the concept of hot-spot regions anid models skewness at two levels global anid local We create a number of hot-spot regions such that the data and queries are located within these hot-spots We use a global skewness parameter denoted by G to vary the size of these host spot regions Assuming that the data space is normalized to 0,11]n hot-spots are assigned rando'm side lengths for each dimension from the range G-1 00.5 1 These regions are centered at random positions within the data space By changin GC one can model sparse cases where most of the data space is not used as well as dense cases where all of the data space is utilized Within each hot spot region data and queries follow one of two distributions namely a uniform distribution UNIF in short or a skewed distribution based on multi-dimensional normals SKEW in short In the latter case the standard deviation for each dimension is assigned randomly using the range L G 1 0.5,1 where L is the local skewness parameter The means of the multi-normals are randomly located within the hot-spot regions Data and query distributions can each be one of UNIF SKEW resulting in four different combinations We compare four partitioning algorithms namely uniform grid UGRID data equi-depth DEDP query equi-depth QEDP and QDPart algorithm using flexible partitioning FLEXP We also compare load shedding using NR sifters against random dropping The default values for various parameters are given in Table I We present a large set of experiments which study the sensitivity of NR sifters to changes in these parameters The overall QoS as formulated in Equation 2 is the main metric for most of our experiments However we also report results on construction time and filter lookup-time All experiments were performed on a 3Ghz Intel P4 processor using Java with Sun JDK 1.5 B Experimental Results We divide our experimental study into three sets of experiments The first set of experiments study the interplay of partitioning algorithms and skewness in data and query distributions The second set of experiments study the impact of number of sifter regions on all performance metrics The third set of experiments are sensitivity studies and examine the affect of sample size fairness threshold QoS parameters and query size on overall QoS 1 Partitioning and Skew The graphs in Figure 4 plot overall QoS with different partitioning methods under varying levels of local and global skewness All four combinations of data and query distributions are shown in a total of eight graphs the first four on global skew and the last four on local skew Before we discuss the results in detail we point out that it is more meaningful to examine the relative performance of the alternative approaches from these figures instead of the general trend of overall QoS as a function of skewness especially the local one This is because as the local data skewness approaches extreme values most queries get empty results even without load shedding artificially boosting the overall QoS First we look at the case where query distributions within hot-spot regions are skewed and data distributions are unriform We observe that the best overall QoS achieved by the NR sifters is 60 to 50 and 35 to 65 higher compared to random dropping along the global skewness and local skewness range respectively For this scenario the best partitioning algorithm turns out to be QDPart The closest alternative is data equi-depth partitioning The sub-optimal performance of data equi-depth partitioning can be attributed to its agnostic nature with respect to skewness in query distribution We also observe that query equi-depth partitioning performs the worst among sifter-based approaches and is only slightly better than random dropping This observation holds for all of the cases we studied This shows the importance of capturing the skewness in data distribution which is completely ignored by the query equi-depth partitioning The performance of

effective in most scenarios Figure 6 plots the time it takes to construct a filter on the server side as a function of the number of sifter regions using different partitioning algorithms We observe that for 1  16 the construction cost which involves performing partitioning query consolidation and running the linear solver takes only about about 150 msecs for all approaches For I  50 all alternatives are still close and under  300 msecs However as 1 increases further we see a surprising trend One would expect that filters employing variable partitioning based QDPart approaches VARP in the figure will be costlier to construct Instead we see that data equi-depth partitioning takes the most amount of time with a construction time of 2.7 secs for 1  100 This shows that it is the linear solver that dominates the construction time Clearly it takes more time to configure the data equi-depth filter Note that for the SKEW/UNIF case the default from Table I data equi-depth partitioning performs the best As a result the additional time spent on configuration is put to good use and yields a better overall QoS value Figure 7 studies the impact of number of sifter regions on the lookup time another important performance metric It plots the number of times the lookup operation can be performed within a second This includes the decision to drop or forward a data item which we consider as part of the lookup 1 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 9 fairness 0  10 A 0~1 per second 3 Other Sensitivity Studies Figure 8 plots the overall QoS  30 z=0.9 E 20 0.01 0.0 qu Fig 10 ImI Z=0.1 40 z_05 E  z=0.7 process Figure 7 shows that the number of times the lookup can be performed by equi-depth partitioning based filters only decreases by 27 going from I  16 to I  100 whereas this number is 40 for QDPart based flexible partitioning Yet even for I  100 the latter can imake around 5 million lookups as a function of the throttler for various data and query distributions We see that except for the UNIF/UNIF case the improvement in overall QoS per unit increase in the throttler value is more profound for the heavy load shedding scenarios This shows that NR sifters are very effective when a significant portion of the load has to be shed In agreement with our insight from Section VI-B 1 the UNIF/UNIF case which is an example of the broader case of proportionally distributed queries and data does not benefit from the use of sifters and follows a linear trend This suggests emulation of random dropping behavior Figure 9 plots the improvement in the overall QoS relative to random dropping as a function of the fairness threshold A and for different throttler values In general the higher the fairness threshold the more flexibility we have in setting the drop thresholds thus higher overall QoS at the expense of fairness among queries We observe that this trend is more pronounced for the high load shedding scenarios For instance when we have z  0.3 the relative improvement raises from 5 to 40 while increasing A from 0.1 to 0.9 On the other hand it stays almost flat for the case of z  0.9 Note that the case of z  0.1 is defected since all drop thresholds except one reach to 1 after certain stage and further increase in the fairness threshold does not bring any improvement Figure 10 plots the improvement in the overall QoS relative to random dropping as a function of the query side lengths and for different throttler values When the range queries have increasing volumes more data items match the query regions Thus the same fraction of the dropped stream have increasingly negative impact on the overall QoS Figure 10 shows that the NR sifters provide slightly increased relative improvement over the random dropping as the query volumes get larger only around 15 for the excessive load shedding scenario of z  0 1 However the figure does not plot the unrealistically extreme cases For instance if all queries have the size of the hot spot regions then sifters would obviously not provide any improvement over random dropping VII RELATED WORK Load shedding in stream processing has been an important topic since the inception of DSMSs 17 Previous works in this area have so far focused on either load shedding on operator graphs 10 or specific stream operators such as aggregations 18 19 and joins 20 21 When shedding load in operator graphs moving random drop filters as close to the input streams as possible was established as an effective technique However load-shedding source filters that go beyond random dropping such as NR sifters have not been considered in the past NR sifters their fast construction and optimal configuration are all new problems addressed by this paper Another related research is publish/subscribe exemplified by Gryphon 22 SemCast 23 and Siena 24 Pushing query subscription predicates close to the data sources publishers is a commonly applied paradigm in publish/subscribe systems for reducing the processing load as well as the overall bandwidth consumption However the filtering performed in these systems do not impact the completeness of the query results In other words filters are employed to drop nonrelevant data items that do not impact the query results Yet such filters cannot drop data items of lesser but non-zero value query indexes with a significant distinction a data item is filtered out probabilistically by an NR sifter Their summary nature and use of non-uniformly regulated drop probabilities lend itself to compact and effective load shedding source filters 404 50 


which can optimize query result quality under varying levels of load shedding dictated by dynamic stream rates without incuring high adaptation overhead VIII CONCLUSIONS We presented and formulated the problem of adaptive source filtering and load shedding in the context of data stream processing We introduced a novel type of source filter called non-uniformly regulated sifter which can judiciously drop parts of the data streams at the source nodes by minimally impacting the QoS of the queries installed at the C server This effectively reduces the load at the CQ server by reducing the amount of data fed into the query processor We developed concepts and techniques to quickly construct compact effective in terms of maximizing QoS and efficient in terms of lookup tiime NR sifters Fast construction of compact filters also enables frequent and low-overhead adaption to system dynamics such as aggregate source stream rate and source data distribution We presented large number of experimental results studying the behavior of NR sifters and presented a comparative study of alternative sifter construction schemes We showed that compact sifters are significantly superior to other alternatives such as random dropping especially for heavy load shedding scenarios REFERENCES 1 D Terry D Goldberg D Nichols and B Oki Continuous queries over append-only databases in ACM SIGMOD 1992 2 J Chen D J DeWitt F Tian and Y Wang Niagaracq A scalable continuous query system for internet databases in ACM SIGMOD 2000 3 L Liu C Pu and W Tang Continual queries for internet scale event-driven information delivery IEEE Transactions on Data and Knowledge Engineering TKDE July/August 1999 4 A Arasu B Babcock S Babu M Datar K Ito R Motwani I Nishizawa U Srivastava D Thomas R Varma and J Widom STREAM The stanford stream data manager IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin vol 26 2003 5 H Balakrishnan M Balazinska D Carney U Cetintemel M Cherniack C Convey E Galvez J Salz M Stonebraker N Tatbul R Tibbetts and S Zdonik Retrospective on Aurora VLDB Journal 2004 6 S Chandrasekaran 0 Cooper A Deshpande M J Franklin J M Hellerstein W Hong S Krishnamurthy S R Madden V Raman F Reiss and M A Shah TelegraphCQ Continuous dataflow processing for an uncertain world in CIDR 2003 7 Streambase systems http://www.streambase.com May 2005 8 N Jain L Amini H Andrade R King Y Park P Selo and C Venkatramani Design imrplementation and evaluation of the linear road benchmark on the stream processing core in ACM SIGMOD 2006 9 K.-L Wu P S Yu B Gedik K W Hildrum C C Aggarwal E Bouillet W Fan D A George X Gu G Luo and H Wang Challenges and experience in prototyping a multimodal stream analytic and monitoring application on System S in VLDB 2007 10 N Tatbul U Cetintemel S Zdonik M Cherniack and M Stonebraker Load shedding in a data stream manager in VLDB 2003 11 B Gedik and L Liu Quality-aware distributed data delivery for continuous query services in ACM SIGMOD 2006 12 R Kuntschke B Stegmaier A Kemper and A Reiser StreamGlobe Processing and sharing data streams in grid-based p2p infrastructures in VLDB 2005 13 K.-L Wu S.-K Chen and P S Yu Query indexing with containment-encoded intervals for efficient stream processing Knowledge and Informcation Systems January 2006 14 H.-S Lim J.-G Lee M.-J Lee K.-Y Whang and I.Y Song Continuous query processing in data streams using duality of data queries in ACM SIGMOD 2006 15 B Gedik K.-L Wu and P S Yu Non-uniformly regulated sifters for adaptive load shedding in data stream processing IBM Research Tech Rep RC 24289 2007 16 B Gedik K.-L Wu P S Yu and L Liu A load shedding framework and optimizations for m-way windowed stream joins in IEEE ICDE 2007 17 D Carney U Cetintemel M Cherniack C Convey S Lee G Seidman M Stonebraker N Tatbul and S B Zdonik Monitoring streams a new class of data management applications in VLDB 2002 18 N Tatbul and S Zdonik A subset-based load shedding approach for aggregation queries over data streams in VLDB 2006 19 B Babcock M Datar and R Motwani Load shedding for aggregation queries over data streams in IEEE ICDE 2004 20 A M Ayad and J F Naughton Static optimization of conjunctive queries with sliding windows over infinite streams in ACM SIGMOD 2004 21 B Gedik K.-L Wu P S Yu and L Liu Adaptive load shedding for windowed stream joins in ACM CIKM 2005 22 G Banavar T D Chandra B Mukherjee J Nagarajarao R F Strom  and D C Sturman An efficient multicast protocol for content-based publish-subscribe systems in IEEE ICDCS 1999 23 0 Papaemmanouil and U Cetintemel SemCast Se mantic multicast for content-based data dissemination in IEEE ICDEr 2005 24 A Carzaniga D S Rosenblum and A L Wolf Design and evaluation of a wide-area event notification service vol 19 no 3 200 1 405

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
