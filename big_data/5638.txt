owing to their ability to increase observation sampling in spatial spectral temporal and angular dimensions Past literature from academia and industry have proposed and evaluated many cost models for spacecraft as well as methods for quantifying risk. However, there have been few comprehensive studies quantifying the cost for multiple spacecraft for small satellites and the cost risk for the operations phase of the project which needs to be budgeted for when designing and building efficient architectures. This paper identifies the three critical problems with the applicability of current cost and risk models to distributed small satellite missions and uses data-based modeling to 
suggest changes that can be made in some of them to improve applicability Learning curve parameters to make multiple copies of the same unit technological complexity based costing and COTS enabled small satellite costing have been studied and insights provided    T ABLE OF CONTENTS   1  I NTRODUCTION   1  2  L ITERATURE REVIEW   2  3  D ATA AND METHODS   7  4  R

To avoid being cost prohibitive, small satellites will be required to enable DSMs especially those with large numbers However costing small satellite DSMs is challenging because of the following reasons   There is no standard cost 
to copy database or learning curve model established for multiple satellites NASA prescribes an 85 learning curve 3  w h ic h  w ill b e in v es tig a ted  in  th is  p ap er    Standard models including the Small Satellite Cost Model or SSCM 4   p ar a m e tr ic co s ts   a n d  th e RAND Models 5   an alo g ical co s ts   r an g e f r o m  at  least 20 kg to 500 kg of satellite mass There is a large class of small satellites including the cubesat standard that falls out of range for both such traditional models  Constellations especially formation flying missions have more programmatic overhead and need more ground station support for orbit maintenance This translates to operations cost more than what 
parametric percentages estimate There is therefore a need to assess the applicability of current cost models to small satellite DSMs and to formulate reliable cost model components to fill up the existing gaps. The improved cost model should efficiently differentiate between costs of the different architectures for designing a DSM toward a particular Earth observation goal and therefore serve as a tool to understand the cost impact of increased performance Such a cost tool is especially important for DSM design because of the larger number of variables than traditional spacecraft design \(e.g. number of satellites, inter-satellite

 4 The typical problems that RAND uncovered with respect to spacecraft costing 22  w er e d ata li m ited  b y  t h e  following small sample sets because large scale production in spacecraft manufacturing does not exist  suppliers rarely making internal efficiency optimizations because delivering highly integrated payload requires very specific designs therefore no minimal generalizations and diverse stakeholders for every mission  Expert opinion proved superior to formal estimation in 33 cases \(15 total\, inferior in 33% and no difference in the last 33%. Unmitigated technical risk was identified as the biggest factor in cost overruns 22   ca s es s t u d ied  b ein g  SBIRS and GPS, and the risks were primarily attributed to inadequate systems engineering aggressive adoption of commercial standards for military applications lack of process controls at contractors or their lack of domain knowledge and reduction in acquisition workforce due to budget cuts. In spite of the above problems, some projects did have risk assessment for each WBS but were limited by the following problems [22     Little data availability e.g inadequate reviews of contractor work  Credibility e.g inadequate experience judgment independence  Limitations in risk quantification e.g analysts assumed 17 cost growth when historical data showed 50 growth and led to 250 in reality expert subjectivity erroneous cost-probability distributio   were used for probability distributions  Unavailability of methods for large cost growth \(e.g risk is defined as variance of prediction so low prediction implies low risk without any validation of such an assumption  The RAND study of Air Force Missions found that most mission costs grew over their lifetimes or experienced mission creep A metric called Cost Growth Factor or CGF was defined as the ratio of the final cost to the estimated costs using Milestone II estimates 23  w h er e  CGF  1 represented underruns and CGF > 1 represented overruns Un certainties and cost growth 23  w er e  identified to be caused by new technology economic conditions or rare events after accounting for funding category inflation timeline/milestones and other such correlations Recommendations included using many validation methods and having a consistent tracking method in place    Table 2: Typical cost models available for pricing the development and operation cost of a LEO satellite mission [22    There are several cost models available for costing satellites in low Earth orbit \(LEO\, as identified in Table 2  26   T h e m aj o r  m et h o d s  ar e ca teg o r ized  u n d er  to p  down estimations or parametric models bottom up estimations or component models analogy based estimations from historical missions and expert judgment Specifically for Earth observation missions from LEO instrument cost is a parametric function of mass power and data rate. Bus cost is the sum of costs from different subsystems which is a parametric function of the subsystem mass. Integration, assurance and test \(IAT\ and systems engineering \(SE\ costs are a function of satellite mass recurring or satellite cost non-recurring while operations cost is a function of lifetime and spacecraft cost as obtained from the NASA Spacecraft Operations Cost model [27  Operations cost of small satellites is 8 of TMC and 20 of bus cost more than large satellites wh ere operations is only 7% of bus cost 28  This again is dependent on the human resource costs in the operating organization Program overhead includes recurring and non recurring 26  co s ts  w it h  r esp ec ti v e  co s t e s ti m ati n g  relationships CER  errors of 39 and 36 lower for small satellites Overall overhead is 8.9 and 9.3 of bus cost for small and large S/C respectively [5    2 8

Complexity was not considered aside from the number of spacecraft  The author characterized capabilities of a DSM as a function of information isolation rate integrity and availability and performance as the probability that system satisfies requirements in terms of capabili ty  and u se d Markov states and integrate on lifecycle cost as a sum of baseline cost and failure compensation cost The cost model captured program slip and adaptability metrics e.g changing configuration for the same mission i.e elasticity or adapting for different mission goals i.e flexibility could be added The GINA model was combined with multi objective optimization to select the most suited architecture for any specific mission [33   Fo r  example in the Terrestrial Planet Finder case study the trade was between acquiring a certain number of  images and the cost as characterized by the GINA model  The Phoenix project assessment 34  p er f o r m ed  b y  J P L  and Aurora Flight Sciences uses a complexity based cost model to estimate development costs 30    3 5    it u s e s  parametric equations for programmatic cost estimation and the usual 85 NASA learning curve estimate to calculate the cost of making many copies of the same spacecraft  Launch Cost Modeling Modeling launch costs for multiple spacecraft is difficult because of the complexity of choosing between single and staged launches and/or primary and secondary launches TransCostSystems in Germany 36    aunch Vehicles LV and minimized development and operations cost rather than the traditional approach of maximizing performance and minimizing weight LV cost models demonstrated included PRICE-H TRASIM TRANSCOST and it was found that all CERs compute costs to be 1525  higher than ideal cost Cost was calculated as a function of payload capacity  engine technology number of engin e qualification tests engines per stage maintenance and refurbishment  Just lower weight did not mean lower cost For example thrusters were found to last longer if operated at 5-8 below max thrust therefore eliciting a trade between lifetime performance and deployment cost Similarly there was an automated optimizer to tap into different technologies to minimize cost Risk and Uncertainty Assessment The RAND reports \([22    2 3    d is cu s s ed  in  th e  p r ev io u s  sections highlight the critical impact of risk on cost therefore more literature was reviewed to summarize available methods and statistically derived quantities quantify estimating uncertainty 23  The studies concluded that uncertainty about technical and programmatic inputs need to be quantified Expert opinion has biases stemming from information availability, representativeness, anchoring and adjustment and overconfidence There may also be conflicts of interest or  the process may be over-rushed Cause-effect relationships can be quantified using Markov trees. Risks should be defined understood and evolved with an evolving system  Recommendations 23  o n  r is k  a s s e s s m e n t  i n cl u d ed  th e  u se  of  multiple independent experts a sk ing experts to provide at a minimum upper lower and most-likely values for cost elements under consideration f it ting a triangle distribution to these three numbers and using the upper and lower values to bound 90 percent of the probability  eliciting other percentiles to counter the effect 


 6 bias and providing feedback to expert in an iterative process that is documented   Cost Risk methodologies 24  in clu d e q u alitati v e an d  qu antitative methods as shown in Figure 2 The following cautions apply to data collection and analysis methods mentioned in the figure Historical analogies need credible data from similar projects which are hard to find and susceptible to large time scales CGF may be databased but it does not capture layers of influence that caused the growth. Sensitivity analysis needs exact CERs however if the range of variation is not known a priori select hazards should be identified Probabilistic outputs as distribution functions instead of a deterministic poi nt estimate should be encouraged. Error propagation is easy when CERs are linear but complex relationships including precision of input and accuracy of computers need to be considered for probabilistic outputs  Figure 2: Summary of cost risk assessment methods suitable for spacecraft programs [24    Subject matter experts capable of estimating cost and uncertainty are very flexible but may be biased thus careful iterative conduction and documentation is required Different methods in Figure 2  should be combined to mitigate bias inherent to a single method A method of moments is easy for normal distributions  means variances add. For other distributions, percentiles are hard to calculate. For such cases Monte Carlo \(MC simulation finds integrals and sums of random variables which are too complex for closed-form equations MC methods may add and propagate variables different distributions \(Weibull, lognormal, triangular\ can be used expert opinion can be included, correlations captured and are well-understood numerically  It is a computationally expensive method and saved only for very high fidelity calculations  Overall, methods to evaluate uncertainty are suggested in the RAND Cost Uncertainty Report for the USAF Weapon Systems [24     Benefit-cost analysis but benefits/risks difficult to quantify  Expert judgment \(use Delphi method but experts can disagree  Fault tree analysis for complex correlated risks with specific hazards considered and cost risks rolled back into the WBS  Focus groups/oneon one interviews for individual behaviors, communication error warning esp. among decision makers  Root cause analysis or FMEA examine the consequences of failures or risk and chains of them and make recommendations.

Historical analysis should be used in cases characterized by little time or information or as a supplement  Monte Carlo is not always the best because it lacks transparency is subject to implementation errors and requires significant data and time  Value centric risk methodology or VCRM was first mentioned in the context of the DARPA F6 Program in 2  6  an d   3 7   f o r  v alu e ce n tr ic d esig n  in academia and industry  Risk types considered were  technical \(e.g. low TRL of a new component being deployed such as a polymer battery  cost e.g outsourcing not working out due to export control and programmatic e.g the launch vehicle not ready  Risk management mechanisms suggested were  take  avoid  and mitigate VCRM was given a stronger quantitative framework by de Weck when applied to the  DARPA F6 Phase 2 38  The report quantifies probabilistic impact of individual risk items on

Probability of occurrence is available from a Markov Model S state transition matrix where robustness and adaptability measures can also be coded Risk impact computed by turning input knobs individual and coupled VARG probability and impact computed over lifetime like Monte Carlo methods   Capturing Complexity Since all risk reports caution against technical and programmatic risks and small satellites pack state of the art technologies into a small form, it is very important to quantify complexity of small satellite DSMs and map this complexity to cost and risk Typical spacecraft complexities discussed in the literature fall in to  three categories   Component-level complexity  Aerospace Corporation has a very evolved method of quantifying component complexity relative to existing flight components and claims it to be a b  dollars \([39    4 0     Technical uncertainties can be factored into component complexities as a function of TRL as demonstrated in the DARPA META program 30    Structural complexity \([30    3 5     Complexity arising from complex dependencies within the system  Can be calculated from the design structure matrix of the system, captures emergent behavior and influences development cost of the system   Dynamic complexity \([30    3 5     Representative of operational complexity during different mission stages  Each mission mode can be quantified in state space and the probability of success of each mode calculated  Eventually the idea is to calculate the impact on cost of all the above complexities however such a mapping currently exists for only component and structural levels 3  D ATA AND METHODS   From the literature review we gathered the following insights for improving cost models for small satellite DSMs   To calculate cost to copy, cost data of an in-house DSM mission before and after CDR Critical Des ign Review will be needed For example the second copy of SwissCube [41  o r  Sw i s s C u b e 2  is  expected to be  45-60% of the original Swiss-Cube depending on spares and assuming a new workforce Regression analysis on other missions especially NASA missions will provide more insight  In the absence of openly available WBS data on small satellites, the available cost models cannot be improved to get more precise CERs for small satellites Snatches of data available from online 42  an d  GSFC  r elea s ed  s o u r ce s  ca n  at m o s t let u s  check the validity of the CER estimates for small satellites  Lifecycle risk modeling using techniques such as Monte Carlo and VARG is possible from a theoretical standpoint but model fidelity is questionable without risk-cost data for validation  All the above techniques  cost to copy single satellite modeling and lifecycle simulation can be combined into  System Dynamics \(SD\ model of DSM operations System Dynamics is a well-established field that draws inspiration from basic feedback control principles to create simulation models [43   SD co n s tr u ct s  stocks flows causal loops time delays feedback interactions enable investigators to describe and potentially predict complex system performance which would otherwise be impossible through analytical methods. SD is argued to be superior for DSM modeling in comparison with other modeling tools such as discrete event simulation like VARG or Monte Carlo methods because it is a robust, discrete time simulation that allows simultaneous simulation of quantitative and qualitative parameters captures latencies and delays captures nonlinear processes through simple causal structures and physically explains complex feedback interactions based on these simple structures [43    4 4    


 8  The component interactions in the SD model \(e.g. causal relationships can be quantified using known parametric or physics-based equations obtained from the literature review and captured insights above. The behavior of each module of the model is benchmarked against data  whenever available even if very sparse  from past and current DSMs We have compiled a list of 60 DSMs  introduced in the next section  which can be used as reference modes to calibrate the SD model   Figure 3: Examples of previous and planned DSMs sorted by their individual spacecraft masses \(average when not homogeneous\, grouped by the small spacecraft class defined in Figure 1   Collection of Data from Past Missions  The NASA GSFC Distributed Space Missions Group [45  gathered data from 59 DSMs  past operational and planned from publicly available sources. They spanned over many architectures such as constellations clusters formation flying virtual telescopes, etc. and over a wide range of applications including science commercial communications, defense and technology demonstrations The data was sorted based on type of mission, spacecraft configuration, number of spacecraft, lifespan, cost, etc. so that insights could be drawn on DSMs Figure 3  shows DSMs from this study grouped in vertical columns by the mass-based satellite classes defined in Figure 1  panel The average masses of the individual spacecraft determine the position on the Y-axis of the data point   Unfortunately cost data from public sources was not available for all the missions and WBS elements were not available at all Reference 42  r e p o r ted  s ch ed u le s lip s  and cost overruns for many of the above missions especially those without fixed price contracts Annual contracts were often re-negotiated for every year for every contractor leading intractable cost data collection issues as well as an incalculable creep To avoid getting into unreliable details only the total cost of the mission as it stands today was used  Note that although the data has been primarily sorted by mass for regression analysis for simplicity small satellite mission costs are primarily driven by technology For example, 20Mbit/s X-band transmitters by Axelspace in Japan at 1 kg mass cost 300,000 because the cost is driven up by shrinking a very high tech instrument into a small form. Cost is thus a factor of both the high tech and the small size This implies that for a sufficiently advanced Earth observation mission the benefits of cheaply launching a lower mass may be outweighed by fitting the technology into the lower mass Cost models should be able to capture the conflicting effects of both variables to select the right monolithic architecture and therefore, DSM architecture 4  R ESULTS AND INFERENCES   Insights from analyzing the data from 59 DSMs and estimating costs using available cost models are presented in this section The system dynamics modeling results to calculate development and operations cost and address the lifecycle risk gap in literature will be described in a later publication Regression Analysis of Past Mission Data For regression analysis we will revisit the DSMs from Figure 3  Twenty of the fifty nine studied DSMs, masses notwithstanding have two homogeneous or heterogeneous spacecraft  The Earth observation missions or ones with science payload clearly show a decreasing mass with increasing numbers The navigation and communication missions costing billions of dollars are the ones on the top right  Thirty five of the fifty nine missions for which cost and mass data was available have been scatter plotted in Figure 4 The colors correspond to the size based classes 


 9 of the DSM satellites For each class linear top and exponential \(bottom\ curves are fit to the cost vs. number of satellites data spread.  Under the over-assumption, that the classes represent similar sizes and the same organizational framework developed and operated all the missions linear curves represent non-recurring costs and exponential curves represent recurring costs Nanosatellites and medium satellites are the only classes that show a high correlation for both types of fits possibly owing to similar modus operandi of DSM development over the available data set This also helps es tablish consistent data for the nano-satellite class  The scatter plot in Figure 4  was also sorted in terms of types of orbits, spatial relationship between the satellites functional category etc however none of those groupings produced a correlation coefficient higher than the size based sorting Hence the latter was used for further regression analysis  While Figure 4  assumes the entire cost to be either nonrecurring top or recurring bottom reality is a combination of the two where  TMC = NRE + RE NRE = NRE 0  N RE = RE 0 N log 2 b  1 Non-recurring costs are one-time expenses and therefore do not follow the economies of scale Recurring costs alleviated from having more units because learning reduces further costs For example ground system costs are considered entirely non-recurring costs while launch costs or integration and testing costs are entirely recurring costs [27   Oth er  W B S c o s ts  ar e a co m b in a tio n  o f  b o th    N on linear least squares regression was then used with the TMC data to find RE 0  theoretical first unit  TFU  recurring cost NRE 0  TFU non-recurring cost and b learning curve factor The results for each mass-based class of satellites have been listed in Tabl e 3 right panel The learning parameter is 0.77 for nano-satellites and 0.79 for medium satellites which is lower than the NASA prescribed value of 0.85 3   Un d er  th e  as s u m p tio n  o f  TMC  RE linear least squares regression may be used and the results are listed in the left panel. It is only under this assumption that we get the NASA prescribed learning factor of 0.85 or more The analysis shows that the prescription possibly overestimates the cost of making multiple copies of a spacecraft    Figure 4  Scatter plot of previous and planned DSMs by the size of their individual spacecraft masses average when not homogeneous\ and number of physical entities in the DSM, grouped \(in color\ by the small spacecraft class defined in Figure 1 Linear \(top and exponential \(bottom\ regression curves for each size-based group shown  Tabl e 3: Inversion of learning curve parameters using data shown in Figure 4 Left  L inea r inv er s io n performed assuming only recurring costs, [Rig  Non-linear inversion performed assuming sum of recurring and non-recurring costs      Learning Curve Calculations from Cost to Copy Factors JHU APL published results of their analyses to find the cost to copy multiple copies of a spacecraft or instrument in 2013 46   A P L  h a s  d ev e l o p ed  an d  m a n u f ac t u r ed  t h e

A learning curve parameter of 0.662 from the previous section has been used and has been applied to only the recurring fractions of the TFU cost Recurring fractions are obtained from reference [47   f o r  e x a m p le g r o u n d  s tatio n  support is 0 and IAT is 1  Figure 6  compares the total mission cost minus launch costs of a 1, 2, 5, 9 and 13 satellite DSM using the SSCM solid lines and RAND models dashed lines In both cases, we used   and instrument cost as a function of mass lifetime and data rate A ll other values were model specific  N o complexity, launch costs or extra ground operations costs were considered over the regular operations Software costs were a function of lines of code only which were very difficult to estimate  eventually values analogous to the MIT SPHERES satellites were used 48    4 9    as  currently functional on the International Space Station  RAND  5  an d   2 5     T h e co ef f icie n t  o f  co s t e s ti m ated  in ground operations in the SSCM model is double that in RAND. Since ground operations have been assumed to be entirely non-recurring, the learning economies of scale do not apply As a result the cost predicted by SSCM is lower for few satellites but overshoots the RAND estimates for more satellites Interviews with experts at NASA GSFC revealed that ground operations are more complex and cost more for DSMs than monoliths so the SSCM model seems intuitively more representative   Figure 6: Comparison of costs estimated using RAND  analogous cost model applied to known S/C and instrument costs [19    2 2   dashed lines  4  solid lines with data from real missions text colored by the closest modeled spacecraft weights   A few candidate DSMs from Figure 4 have been highlighted on Figure 6  in the same color as the closest modeled spacecraft weight While most of the data falls very close to the predictions, many precautions should be made The GRACE mission was an international cooperation between USA and Europe and the cost her e  entities are so different that they could be two different missions rather than the same DSM therefore no gain from the learning curve DesdYNI has now been transitioned into the NASA-ISRO SAR mission CYGNSS and CLARREO have are not yet operational so the cost cited is expected cost, and therefore not real data Finally, since none of the models are applicable to model 10 kg spacecraft the nano-satellites in Figure 6  do no t have a curve to fit them Again total cost data is very  internal costs incurred by the universities building the individual satellites  


 11    Figure 7: Cost estimated per subsystem \(bar chart on top\of one spacecraft  Small Satellite Cost Model \(SSCM\ based on inputs for a candidate nano-satellite mission \(bottom excel spreadsheet   The SSCM model was then used to calculate the total cost of developing and manufacturing only the first small satellite of mass 10 kg and other specifications listed  Figure 7 The cost calculated for every subsystem and the total cost of $15.08 million in FY 2010 is therefore a function of technological variables like power and pointing and not just mass  To check the sensitivity of technology used to cost we varied some of the input parameters and checked its effect on cost in FY97 $million. Changing the data rate from 10 kbps to 10 MBps to 1 GBps resulted in a cost of $11.35 11.4 and 11.45 million respectively Since COTS products will be used to support the communication link these cost estimates imply that there will be only a 100,000 difference in deploying a radio transmitter 10 kbps\ or deploying an optical transmitter \(1 GBps\ on the 10 kg nano-satellite While previous proposals have certainly supported the availability for laser technologies 50   t h e o p tical d e m o n s tr ati o n s  t h at ar e c u r r en tl y  b ei n g  developed by DLR in Germany and the Aerospace Corporation in the US 51  clea r l y  d e m o n s tr ate  th a t t h e  cost of optical technology is more than that Similarly changing the pointing accuracy from 0.1 0.01 to 0.001 degrees resulted in the cost increasing from FY97 $ 6.45 11.33 and 22.21 million respectively The technology to support 0.1 degrees \(sun sensors\ is different from that to support 0.001 degrees star trackers However current COTS quotations \(e.g. Blue Canyon technologies XACT show that it costs 100,000 for a nanosat star tracker system Integration may cost a few additional thousands but estimating it to 18 million more sounds a bit too much  The SSCM sensitivity study above highlights the need to have cost models that are more sensitive to different technologies and their associated complexities Complexity and risk assessment has been proposed by the Aerospace Corporation in the form of their COBRA model  We used the COBRA model in our next study where the methodology and data sets are detailed in \([39   40    5 2     T h e d ata s et r elati v e to  w h ic h  co m p le x ities  ar e  calculated included 120 DoD and NASA missions from after FY89 excluded launch delays or failures and projects with heavy international cooperation. Complexity drivers include  Table 4  column 1 subsystem technical parameters e.g mass power performance technology choices\ and programmatic factors \(e.g., heritage, level of redundancy, foreign partnership  Forty such parameters are considered that are either continuous e.g mass power and represent a range of values bounded by a minimum and maximum, or discrete such as propulsion type \(none, cold gas, monopropellant bipropellant or ion engine\ that represent a finite number of choices    For our smallsat case study, the factors corresponding to spacecraft complexity as they proposed are listed in Table 4 along with the minimum and maximum value that the component takes within their data set The column  candidate nano-satellite which will be a part of a DSM  different 3D angles from the same ground spot as it formation flies in LEO 53  5 4 55    Fo r  ea ch  f ac to r   the complexity of the nanosat is calculated as a percentage of where the data point corresponding to the nanosat lies with respect to the data points for all the other space missions considered. For discrete data, the discrete rank of the data is assessed and then converted into a percentage The average complexity of the proposed nanosat is calculated to be 21.64 


 12  Table 4: Cost estimated for a spacecraft as a function of the relative complexity of its components with respect to components used in previous missions  Based Risk Assessment \(COBRA\ model. Inputs \(Data in Column 3\ are from a candidate nanosatellite mission    The map between complexity percentile and required mission cost and development time for successful missions green triangles is shown in Figure 8  using a green trend line. The missions plotted are among the 120 studied missions and equations are mentioned within the  attempted cheaper than or faster than this model predicts then there is a large probability of failure as highlighted by the red and yellow crosses on Figure 8  Using the above model the estimated cost for our candidate nanosatellite 10 kg mission is 35.824 million and the estimated development time is 35.074 months The high cost is in keeping with the intuition expressed in the data collection section that the cost of LEO small satellites are driven more by technology than mass so the utility of shrinking the satellite should be critically assessed and avoided if the mission technology is very state of art In such cases, micro satellites would win the performance to cost ratio battle    Figure 8: Predicted mission cost and development time as a function of relative mission complexity with respect to other missions evaluated by the Aerospace Corporation [39    4 0     5 2    M is s io n c o m ple x it y  is  a  function of component complexities as calculated in Table 4 The candidate mission is a LEO satellite measuring passive Earth reflectance as part of a DSM  We ran a sensitivity analysis for the COBRA model by varying the deltaV and pointing accuracy required by the candidate satellite It does a great job in predicting the increase in costs from 1 degree to 0.01 or 0.1 degree, by 


 13  estimating a $ 200-250 increase. It overshoots the COTS quotations by a slight margin but is certainly better than the SSCM estimate of  18 million more When the required delta-V is increased from none to 40 m/s to 80 m/s to 120 m/s the respective costs are estimated to be FY97 $ 35.79, 35.82, 35.85 and 35.88 million. Quotations from a 3D cold gas propulsion system printing company called AustinSat revealed that their 1U propulsion unit capable of providing 40 m/s of delta V costs 100,000 with 6DOF thrusters included and would scale almost linearly as more 1U units are added for 40 m/s of more delta-V  The COTS systems therefore cost more than what the COBRA model predicts. The model can thus be improved and made more suitable for COTS-supported small satellites if COTS data and figures were included in the data set to calculate complexity. Since we do not have the data set only the published Figure 8  we could not make the changes  Since many small satellite missions are collaborations between many organizations, the COBRA model could be improved by adding a foreign partnership complexity factor that captures the number of collaborators not just the nationality For example a recent paper 56   formulated a data supported method of capturing international cooperation related complexity using cyclometric  complexity where CGF  0.917  0.0575*CyclometricNumber and CyclometricNumber  f\(nodes, edges, outputs    Figure 9: Cost growth required to support increasing TRL for any component as published in [57    Small satellites are always pushing the boundaries of technology. It is very probable that some of its component values will fall out of range available from past missions In such a case, cost models of TRL transition such as the one shown in Figure 9  57  s h o u ld  b e in co r p o r ated  in to  the COBRA model for the relevant factors Although TRL transition correlates to the spending it does not follow traditional 80-20 rule The COBRA model also does not capture the structural complexity of a small tightly packed satellite which has been theoretically shown to drive development costs. Structural complexity can be quantified using a simple framework shown in Figure 10 35  34   an d  ca n  b e ea s il y  i n tr o d u ce d  i n  t h e COBRA model via a new factor and recalculating the data fit  Capturing the above development costs is important for small satellites whose costs are driven more by technology than by mass. Again, since we do not have the data set \(only the published Figure 8 we could not make the changes   Figure 10 Structural complexity metric introduced and validated in [35  a nd   3 4    5  C ONCLUSIONS    We identify three major problems with current cost and risk models that limit their direct application to estimating the costs of DSMs They are the absence of reliable learning curve factors small satellite 20 kg costing tools and operations costing  Existing models and methodologies that may be applicable in part to DSMs have been identified and presented using an extensive literature survey We select ed  some appropriate methods and applied them to estimate the cost of small satellites and small satellite DSMs The exercise helped us point out valuable insights and/or inconsistencies in the results with respect to the data We also suggest methods to modify the models so that they become more suitable for small satellite DSMs  As future work the operations cost model and dynamic complexity of the mission is expected to be captured by a Systems Dynamics Model Re sults from model simulations can provide insight into the effect of design and operation decisions on lifecycle cost and risk expected to improve upon the Monte Carlo results The model results can guide the trade-off of cost with performance and can help in the se lection of a final point design for any given DSM
