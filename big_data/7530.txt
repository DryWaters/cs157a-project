INTRODUCTION  Data mining techniques can be used to discover useful patterns of classificatio n for detecting the protein sequence with similar pattern In this paper patterns are extracted using novel pr iority based data mining algorithm. The priority is based in the similarity count hit\changes with the time series in different datasets, it depends on the item set similarity with the searched protein sequence as input. Once the hit counts are recorded for similar pr otein sequence patterns are extracted from the datasets.  The algorithm is again applied in reverse th at is extracting the non-existing protein sequence from th e datasets using improved Kmeans clustering.  In the proposed system protein sequence pattern is given as an inpu t to be searched from the existing dataset, which is tak en from the Protein Data Bank \(PDB\NCBI \(National Center for BioTechnology Information\t ool. Existing System algorithms do not work based on priority while searching the protein sequence.  This may lead to wrong prediction and the knowledge discovery accuracy level is less.  This paper overcomes this limitat ion with the novel algorithm  II PROBLEM DESCRIPTION  A.  Review of priority based data mining Algorithm   Over the past years the number of known protein structures has been increasing relatively in the fast pace    h e st udy of st ruct ure of protein related to its  function is unknown Structural similarity between proteins allows studying th e evolutionary relationship between remotely homologous proteins. The priority based data mining is process of extracting similar data which is the protein sequence from the huge Protein Data Bank \(PDB oncept of multiprocessing The clustering of the protein sequence is explored using the improved k-means algorithm function prediction  B. The proposed Data mining technique is as follows   Given a protein sequence as an input that has to be searched in the given Dataset D={D 1 D 2 D m D 1  contains N protein sequences S 1 S 2 S n varying lengths L 1 L 2 L n each of the sequence can be represented as S i a il a il aiL i a il     i=1,2..N,  l=1,2..L i and  is set of alphabets that has a position in a sequence that can be pattern recognized  C. Importance of Protein Similarity  This Similarity search in protein sequence is one of the challenging problems in data mining arena [8 A novel priority based Data mi ning algorithm for similar and dissimilar protein sequen ce is two way checking the positive and negative perceptive of the protein sequence The protein sequence search is based on priority based Data mining algorithm which is as follows  Input: Protein sequence \(PM\s to be searched in the Dataset D= {D 1 D 2 D m   Step 1:  Create streams for {D 1 D 2 D m Open all the streams P 1 P2  P m using different threads \(Daemons Step 2:  Read the protein sequence \(PM\be searched Step 3 : Pattern matching that is PM occurrences in Di is recorded  as Count\(n\ach dataset D 1 D 2 D m  which has count of  as n1,n2Én m as the pattern extracted from  item set I=\(item 1 item 2 item t  Step 4:  Compare the count \(n\n1, n2Én m in ascending order A Novel Priority Based Data Mining Algorithm using Improved K-means Clustering for Detecting Protein Sequence from Dataset  S.

Improved K means clustering is used to perform knowledge discovery K-means algorithm is a simple iterative method for a given data set into user speci fied number of cluster. One issue to resolve is how to quantify closet in the assignment step.  The default measure of closeness Euclidean distance in which case one readily show that the non negative cost function will decrease whenever there in change in the assignment or relocation step, hence convergence is gu aranteed in finite number of iterations In this paper the protein se quence is being searched from the four data sets  Homo sapiens, Mammals, Fishes and Birds above referred classification and clustering is performed. The application tool was developed in java using Netbean IDE. The Scatter plot was generated by processing the TABLE I and TABLE II using statistical tool based on the time series. Searching a sample protein sequence èALAê in a dataset                     D.  Problems in Traditional K-Means Clustering algorithm   K-means clustering is po pular for large datasets with both numeric and categorical attr   For the traditional K-means clus tering algorithm, K samples are chosen at random from the whole sample space to approximate centroids of initial clusters is needed to explore the knowledge of the K-means algorithm According to this paper it has a very small number of samples. But PDB has large number of sequence segments generated by our protein dataset. It is impractical to implement Random, Mac-Queen, and Kaufman as the initialization method for K-means clustering technique  E  Problems in New Greedy Initialization Meth od for the K-Means Algorithm  To overcome complex problem of random initialization, the new greedy initialization method tries finding a solution to choo se suitable initial points but the draw back in the new initialization method is the clustering algorithm can only be performed after several iterations during each To overc om e this problem   this paper proposes the improved K-means Algorithm which is as follows  Step 1: Count the number of initial points and count the total number of Cluster Step 2: If the number of initial points discovered is less than the total number of clusters then step 3 else step 6 Step 3: Run the traditional K-m eans algorithm for a fixed number of iterations on the whole sample space Assess the structural similarity of clusters created by each initial point. If the structural similarity for one cluster is bigger than or equal to a given threshold then step 4 else step 5 Step 4: Check the minimum distance of the point creating this cluster with existing po ints in the initialization array If t he minimum distance is bigger than threshold then this new point is included into the initialization array Step 5: go to step2 Step 6: end TABLE I DISPLAYS THAT COUNT FOR THE GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME SERIES  Time/ Species Homosapiens Mammals Birds Fishes T1 1 0 1 1 T2 1 0 3 1 T3 2 1 2 1 T4 0 0 1 0  TABLE II SHOWS THE PRIORITY BASED ON TIME SERIES VERSUS SPECIES  Time/ Species Homosapiens Mammals Birds Fishes T1 6 6 6 6 T2 8 4 10 6 T3 8 4 10 6 T4 8 6 10 4  


  Numerical stability of the cluster algorithm is estimated by performing K-means clustering five times with different random starting poi nts. Only recurrent clusters come into the analysis of resu lts. To save the computation time, the structural similarit y threshold is set as 65% for all the experiments    III. RESULTS A.

Comparison of Performance for the Traditional and Improved K-Means Algorithm   In Table III, the average percentage of sequence segments belonging to clusters with high structural similarity for th e traditional and improved K-means algorithm is given in Table IV.

Table IV shows the number of clusters exceeding given stru ctural similarity thresholds for the traditional and impr oved K-means algorithm  IV. DISCUSSION In the classifi cation of protein sequence segment from Protein Data Bank \(PDB  usi ng the tool NCBI  tool in the detection process, In this paper it applies the priority for searching from th e different Data sets using a novel  priority based Data mining algorithm and using improved k-means clustering fr om dataset of frequent item set.  The priority is ba sed on number of occurrence of protein sequence in the data set for the time series t 1  t 2 t n The priority keeps on changing dynamically depending on the occurrence of the matching pattern Setting priority and directing the classification is the main objective of the paper.  It helps in faster selection of data to an accurate discovery of knowledge.  In future this method can be incorporated with other algorithms for better accurate results.  The improved K-means clustering algorithm is better suited for this type of protein sequence which is searched from the PDB using NCBI tool. Our results reveal much more de tailed hydrophobicity patterns for helices, sheets, and coils than the previous study  V. CONCLUSION   The proposed novel al gorithm for Data mining can be incorporated with other algorithms for better prediction and accuracy. Main advantage in using priority to help classification and to search the protein sequence segments from the large Prot ein Data Bank \(PDB\using NCBI tool. Analysis of protein sequence also shows the improved K-means algorithm may detect some very subtle protein sequence overlooked by the traditional algorithm. The reasonable experimental results shows that improved K-means clustering technique is effective in classifying data with specified similar biological characteristics and in discovering the underlying relationship among the data samples. Since the K-means algorithm is a very powerf ul tool for data mining problems, the improved K-means algorithm may be useful for other important bioi nformatics applications  REFERENCES   Dharmendra  K Roy and Lokesh K sharma, çGenetic Kmeans Clustering Algorithm for mixed numeric and categorial data sets  International Journal of Aritificial intelligence Applications\(IJAIA\irl 2010 , vol.1,no.2  pp.23-28  S.

execution time incurred by IDSM-MFI is quite steady and is shorter than that of DSM-MFI. The experiment shows that IDSM-MFI performs more efficiently DSM-MFI. In Figure 2 \(b\ the memory usage of IDSM-MFI is more stable and smaller than that of DSM-MFI. This is because IDSM-FI adopts a better search method to find sets of maximal frequent itemsets. Hence, it shows that IDSM-MFI is more suitable for mining long frequent itemsets in data streams        a\cution Time        b\mory Usage Figure 2 Comparison with algorithm DSM-MFI 4.1 Comparison with Algorithm DSM-MFI on Different Support Threshold  In this experiment, we examine the execution time between DSM-MFI and IDSM-MFI by dataset T 30 I 20 D1000k and T10.I5 D1000K In Figure 3, we can see that algorithm DSM-MFI is more suitable for large support threshold and sparse data sets. Algorithm IDSMMFI is much better than algorithm DSM-MFI for the suitability of support threshold and data sets       a  T30.I20.D1000        b\  T10.I5.D1000K Figure 3 Comparison with algorithm DSM-MFI on different support threshold 5  Conclusion In this paper we proposed a novel algorithm, IDSMMFI, to discover and maintain maximal frequent itemsets in the current data stream landmark window. The algorithm uses a new SEFI-tree which is developed for incremental maintaining the essential information about maximal frequent itemsets embedded in the stream so far and a topbottom and bottom-top method to mine the set of all maximal frequent itemsets in landmark windows over data stream. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our method can achieve better performance than a representation algorithm DSM-MFI in terms of both time and space overhead, especially when the minimum support is low, and the dataset is dense. In the future, we plan to extend our proposed algorithm to different data stream applications 6  Reference   M  Z a ki and C Hsi a o CH A R M   A n eff i ci en t al go ri t h m  f o r closed itemset mining.

latency encountered could be reduced by a signi\002cant margin It also demonstrates an increase in the cache-hit percentage which indicates that data items are being acquired before they are requested In addition the pre-fetchers accuracy is increased according to the client access frequency since with the increase in the number of requests the patterns could be observed more clearly V C ONCLUSIONS AND F URTHER W ORK This paper presents a model that extrapolates the users data access requests by using a semantic linking over the data source to provide them with a better performance system regardless of network variations code details and data access patterns The proposed model is also bandwidth-adaptive in the sense that it adapts to varying bandwidths and varies its caching capacity correspondingly It is found to be successful in prefetching the data search items from the data cloud with good accuracy and relatively little overhead Moreover this model can also be used over a data source that contains dynamically changing data items by using the concept of merely comparing the update time of the content with that of the one in the cache Currently we are investigating the use of various types of server-side statistics to promote or demote semantic links that will adapt to the overall access behavior of the web-application clients In addition we are considering possible adjustments that are to be made to the current algorithm when the data source contents are rapidly changing We aim to 002nd the costs that are to be incurred in such situations and then try to reduce them by using a hybrid version of this technique R EFERENCES  ABI Research 223W idgets and the apps dilemma for smartphones netbooks media tablets and connected mobile devices,\224 2010  A v ailable http://www abiresearch.com/research/1003385  IBM de v eloperW orks 223IB M surv e y IT professionals predict mobile and cloud technologies will dominate enterprise computing by 2015,\224 Oct 2010 A v ailable http://www03.ibm.com/press/us/en pressrelease/32674.wss  H Zhuge R Jia and J Liu 223Semantic link netw ork b uilder and intelligent browser  Research articles,\224 Concurrency and Computation Practice and Experience  vol 16 pp 1453\2261476 2004 doi:10.1002/cpe.v16:14  Coda Research 223W i-\002 enabled mobile phone handsets in the US 2010-2015,\224 2010 A v ailable http://www codaresearch.co.uk wi\002cellular/abstract.pdf  ComScore Research 223Understand mobile trends and consumer behavior,\224 2010 A v ailable http://www comscore.com Products Services/Product Index/MobiLens  A Besta vros 223Using speculation to reduce serv er load and ser vice time on the WWW,\224 in Proc of ICIKM  1995 pp 403\226410 doi:10.1145/221270.221653  D Albrecht I Zuk erman and A Nicholson 223Pre-sending documents on the WWW A comparative study,\224 in Proc of IJCAI  vol 2 1999 pp 1274\2261279  M Deshpande and G Karypis 223Selecti v e Mark o v models for predicting web page accesses,\224 ACM Trans Internet Technol  vol 4 no 2 pp 163\226184 May 2004 doi:10.1145/990301.990304  E P  Markatos and C E Chronaki 223 A top-10 approach to prefetching the web,\224 in Proc of INET  1998  J Hine C W ills A Martel and J Sommers 223Combining client knowledge and resource dependencies for improved world wide web performance,\224 in Proc of INET  1998  C W u and M Bauer  223I mpro ving web serv er performance with predictive caching,\224 in Proc of ICOMP  Las Vegas NV 2004 pp 145\226149  S Gupta A Joshi J Santiago and A P atw ardhan 223Query distrib ution estimation and predictive caching in mobile ad hoc networks,\224 in Proc of MobiDE  2008 pp 24\22630 doi:10.1145/1626536.1626542  L Y in and G Cao 223Supporting cooperati v e caching in ad hoc netw orks 224 IEEE Trans Mobile Comput  vol 5 no 1 pp 77\22689 Jan 2006 doi:10.1109/TMC.2006.15  Amazon.com Inc 223Documentation of the elastic load balancing over Amazon EC2,\224 2009 A v ailable http://a ws.amazon.com elasticloadbalancing

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
