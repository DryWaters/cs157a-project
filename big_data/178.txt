  10 launched on the same 2110 Taurus vehicle configuration in 1999 with the KOMPSAT satellite  Orbital has flown numerous missions from the Mission Operations Center \(MOC\lles using the MAESTRO ground software for command and telemetry. The MOC is shown below in Figure 10. This software is hosted on Sun workstations running the Solaris operating system. The most recent missions are OV-3 and GALEX. Both programs are running smoothly and operating as planned. ACRIMSAT has recently converted over to using the MAESTRO system for operations as well. USN is supporting the GALEX mission, including X-band pass services at Hawaii and Australia. Glory will follow this proven path. USN has also supported most of Orbital’s geo-synchronous satellite launches and on orbit checkouts    Figure 10 – Orbital’s Mission Operations Center  6  S UMMARY   In the case of the Glory program, it is concluded that reuse of many components from the VCL program not only significantly reduces the cost of the Glory mission but helps to make something of what could be shelved for an indeterminate amount of time.  By employing existing resources and knowledge from a program that was very mature, the Glory program is doing its part to contribute to cost saving measures and maximizing benefit to NASA. The Glory program provides savings of nearly $15M over a ground-up bus design effort, while mitigating significant risk on the bus portion of the mission  Glory is an ideal mission for ear th sciences in the realm of climate change research. It draws from significant flight heritage elements in both th e instruments and the spacecraft bus. It uses an existing NASA asset with minor refurbishment to save significant development costs. It uses a LV that has flown several NASA and DOD missions to date. The ground system employs flight proven hardware and software with a robust plan for backup coverage   7  R EFERENCES   NASA Facts Aerosols June 1999   NASA Godda rd Space Flight Center Glory Program Science and Mission Requirements Document  Greenbelt, Maryland, February 2, 2004  8  B IOGRAPHIES   Darcie A.

Currently she is supporting the Glory program in the Systems Engineering Division as well as supporting the Concept Exploration and Refinement Program.  Her experience is both on hardware and paper study programs ranging from Crew Preference Items for Lockheed Martin to Crew Exploration Vehicle Design for Orbital Sciences Corporation.  She graduated with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from Texas A&M University.  Past experience includes flight certification of ISS hardware at Johnson Space Center in Houston and work with the Advanced Missions Architecture Group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California   Thomas J. Itchkawich is a Program Director working for the VP of Science and Technology Programs in the Space Systems Group at Orbital Sciences Corporation in Dulles Virginia. Tom is currently managing the operations support for ACRIMSAT managing the Glory program at Orbital, and managing an internal ERP conversion in his spare time. He has successfully launched the Mighty Sat I satellite on the Shuttle Endeavour, and the ACRIMSAT satellite on Taurus. He has supported numerous other programs at both CTA Space Systems and Orbital Sciences. In a previous incarnation he was the lead engineer for the Pegasus payload fairing from inception through design, fabrication, qualification testing and the first four flights. A true Fighting Blue Hen, Tom graduated with a Bachelor’s of Mechanical Engineering from the University of Delaware. The first ten years of his career were spent at Hercules Aerospace working on composite rocket motor cases, including Titan IVB, Delta GEM strap-ons, and Filament Wound Case Shuttle boosters. Tom was part of the Pegasus Team that was awarded the National Medal of Technology, and the MightySat team that was awarded the Program of the Quarter by AFRL. He has several other published papers on composite structures and low-cost satellite missions
