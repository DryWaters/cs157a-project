The \nrapid development of modern processors facilitates us with \npowerful SIMD instruction sets, which provides an opportuni-\nty for better performance Although SIMD based optimization \non compression have been explored in some studies [2, 7], these \nstudies usually focus on modifying the existing algorithms to fit \ninto the SIMD instruction.  In this paper, we propose a com-\npression framework with a novel storage layout format, which \naims to improve instruction-level parallelizability of compres-\nsion algorithms. By instantiating the framework, we design a \nnovel compression algorithm family, called Group-Scheme, \nand present a parallelized version of Group-Scheme, called nSIMD-Group-Scheme. We evaluate the proposed algorithms \non two public TREC data sets. With very competitive perfor-\nmance on compression ratio and encoding speed, SIMD-\nGroup-Scheme significantly outperforms the implementation \nwithout SIMD instructions and state-of-the-art algorithm \(i.e. \nSIMD-G8IU [7 decoding speed. \nKeywords-SIMD; inverted index; index compression; integer \nencoding \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nIn the past decade, index compression has been an impor-\ntant technique in Web search engines to deal with big data nMany studies have been devoted to developing efficient \nindex compression algorithms on posting lists [5,6 Howev-\ner, most of these studies focus on the algorithm itself. In \nparallel with explosive growth of data the rapid develop-\nment of modern processors facilitates us with a great chance \nto re-consider how to design compression algorithms by \nincorporating hardware-level parallelism. We notice that the \nSSE instruction sets in Intel’s processor operate on 128-bit \nregisters, which are potentially able to process multiple 32-\nbit integers simultaneously [9]. Based on it, in this paper we \nfocus on developing effective and efficient compression \nalgorithms for Web data by leveraging parallelizability from \nmodern processors on instruction level. \nAlthough SIMD based optimization on inverted index \ncompression have been explored in some studies 2,7], they \nusually focus on modifying the existing algorithms to fit into \nthe SIMD instruction set Different from them, we have iden-\ntified a key and common difficulty in parallelizing previous \ncompression algorithms on instruction level: the storage \nlayout format impedes the effective parallelization of com-\npression algorithms. For example, in Simple-9/16 [8], a 4-bit \npattern together with the 28-bit compressed data is stored in \nthe same 32-bit word and data segments are organized in a \nconsecutive order. It is difficult to process multiple 32-bit \nwords in parallel.  \nTo address this difficulty, we propose a general compres-\nsion framework that aims to make compression algorithms \noptimizable by SIMD instructions. The key lies in the pro-\nposed storage layout format with two highlights. First, we \nseparately store controlling patterns from compressed data. \nSecond, we propose to use a k-way vertical data organization \nway, which makes the algorithm potentially parallelizable by \nSIMD instructions. We present a detailed description of the nframework and discuss the important points on how to incor-\nporate the SIMD based parallelism. \nWe further instantiate the framework by developing a \nnovel compression algorithm family, called as Group-\nScheme, which is built on the storage layout of the proposed \nframework and potentially has better instruction-level paral-\nlelizability compared to traditional compression algorithms \n[4,6,10]. Group-Scheme is very flexible to adapt to different \ndata sets by adjusting two controlling settings, i.e., compres-\nsion granularity and length descriptor. We further present a \nparallelized implementation of Group-Scheme, called as nSIMD-Group-Scheme, by exploiting SIMD instructions to \naccelerate encoding/decoding procedures. To evaluate the \nproposed methods, we construct extensive experiments on \ntwo public datasets.  \nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We \nreview related work on compression algorithms in Section II. \nWe present the general compression framework in Section \nIII. Section IV and Section V present our novel posting lists nencoding algorithm \(i.e. Group-Scheme i.e. SIMD-Group-Scheme respec-\ntively. Section VI presents experimental details, followed by \nour conclusion in Section VII. \nII RELATED WORK \nIn this section, we will introduce the related work in the \nencoding of posting lists nInverted Index. Inverted index, as the primary structure \nof search engines, mainly includes dictionary and posting \nlists, where one term in the dictionary corresponds to one \nposting list. Each posting list is composed of several post-\nings, and each posting is a triplet, namely, <DocID, TFt, \n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 525\n[pos1, pos2, …, posTF]>. DocID is the identifier of a docu-\nment d, TFt is the number of term t in document d, and posi \nmeans the position of ith occurrence of term t in document d. \nDocIDs are usually stored separately from corresponding \nfrequency values and the position values. Generally, all post-\nings in one posting list are sorted ascendingly by DocID. In nimplementation, a commonly adopted transformation opera-\ntion on posting lists is d-gaps. For a strictly 


increasing posi-\ntive integer sequence d1, d2, …, dn, the d-gap operation re-\nplace each integer di with \(di di-1 – 1 following classes:  \n1 represent a integer, Such as Rice cod-\ning[3], Elias Gamma Encoding [1], and k-Gamma [2].  \n2 encoding formats. These formats represent \nan integer by several bytes, such as Variable Byte\(VB  Group Variable Byte\(GVB   speed \nof GVB to up to 3 times. Depending on the representation \ntype of control bits in SIMD-based GVB, we called their \nvectorized decoding variants SIMD-GVB, SIMD-G8IU, \nSIMD-G8CU in this paper. \n3 encoding formats. These formats try to \nencoding as much integer as possible in a 32-bit or 64-bit \nword Simple-9/16 [8] divides a 32-bit codeword into two \nparts: the 4-bit selector/pattern segment and 28-bit data seg-\nment. It uses 9/16 different selectors to distinguish the com-\nbination of integers in the 28-bit data segment.  \n4 10]. The encoding \nalgorithm first chooses a bit width b, such that most of the \nintegers can be represented using b bits, which will be stored \nin a “normal” array. Those out-of-range integers will be \nstored in an exception array. \nIII. A GENERAL SIMD-BASED COMPRESSION \nFRAMEWORK \nIn this section, we present a general compression frame-\nwork and a novel storage layout, in which we can easily \nparallelize compression algorithms by using SIMD-\ninstructions without modifying the algorithmic logics.  \nA. Horizontal and Vertical Storage Layout \n...Int3Int1 Int2 Int4\n0 128\nInt7Int5 Int6 Int8\n32 64 96\n......Int1 Int5 Int2\n0 128\nInt3Int6 Int7\n32 64 96\n... Int8Int4\n\(a b vertical data layout. \nWe first discuss how to store encoded integers in consec-\nutive space. There are two widely used types of data layout: \n\(1 original order of these integers; \(2 groups, \nwhere each group corresponds to a 32-bit word. \nHorizontal layout is more suitable for sequential nprocessing, while vertical layout is more flexible for parallel \nprocessing [2]. In Figure 1, we present an illustrative exam-\nple for a 4-way vertical layout. Int1 ~ Int8 denote 8 encoded \nintegers and each four consecutive integers are stored in four \ndifferent groups. \nB. Encoding Format and Layout Design \nA sequential algorithm S usually contains the control sec-\ntion \(a.k.a. pattern section nrepresented by natural binary data, in storage layout. Data \nsection stores the encoded integers, and pattern section de-\ntermines the start position and end position of each encoded \nintegers in data section. In VB encoding [4], the pattern sec-\ntion is encoded by the most significant bit in each byte and \nthe data section is encoded by the lower 7 bits of each byte. \nIn Simple-9 [6], the data section is the lower 28 bits in each n32-bit codeword. The difficulty in paralleling previous me-\nthods lies in that they store each pattern section and data \nsection together. Our major idea is to separate patterns from \ndata, and adopt the interleaving data sections. \n \nFigure 2.  An illustrative example for storage layout formatting of the ngeneral compression framework. P is short for Pattern Segment, BD is \nshort for Binary Data. \nGiven a sequential algorithm S, we now introduce the de-\ntails of layout format. First, assign consecutive data sections \nto a group and enlarge each binary data section to the maxi-\nmum section size in the group. For example, we have four \ncompressed data sections with m1,m2,m3 and m4 bits respec-\ntively \(See Fig. 2\(a m=max\(m1,m2,m3,m4 the pattern section accordingly \(See \nFig. 2\(b pattern area, and extract the data sections, storing \nthem consecutively in data area, as shown in Fig 2\(c Data \narea can be considered as several consecutive 128-bit words. \nNext we modify the storage layout within data area into the \n526\nfollowing general compression framework \(shown in Figure \n2\(d divided into consecutive 128-bit seg-\nments. Each four 32-bit sub-segments will share the \nsame compression pattern. \nz The data area adopts 4-way vertical storage layout to \nreorganize the corresponding 128-bit word in order to \nachieve parallelism. \nC. Encoding Procedure \nThe encoding procedure of the general compression nframework is as follows:  \n[Step 1] Find the maximal of each four integers from the \noriginal integer array and build the array, called MaxArr. \n[Step 2] Run algorithm S on MaxArr and get the com-\npressed bit stream Extract the binary data area, and record \nthe compression patterns of each 32-bit word. \n[Step 3] In accordance with the compression patterns of \neach 32-bit word of the binary area in Step 2, call sequential nalgorithm S, and use the same representation to encode each \nfour consecutive integers from original integer array. Inter-\nleave the kth, k+1th, k+2th, k+3th integers into four consec-\nutive 32-bit words in data area where k=1, 5, 9, 13 ..., etc. \nThis step can be potentially parallelized using SIMD instruc-\ntions. \nD Decoding Procedure \nThe decoding procedure is described as follows:  \n[Step 1] Read the compression patterns 


for each four 32-\nbit sub-segments in binary data area. \n[Step 2] For each four 32-bit sub-segments in data area, \ncall the algorithm S to concurrently extract the four-multiple \nnumber of integers’ data \(or extract the parts of the four in-\ntegers, where the rest lies in the next four 32-bit sub-\nsegments also be potentially parallelized \nusing SIMD instructions. \nE. Discussion \nThe above general compression framework can be consi-\ndered as a wrapper of compression algorithms to improve \nparallelism using SIMD instructions. The major efforts to \nwrap a compression algorithm in this framework are to adapt \nthe algorithm to the novel storage layout instead of the algo-\nrithm logics. It is noteworthy the parallelizability still de-\npends on specific compression algorithms. Step 1 and 2 of \nthe encoding procedure and Step 1 of the decoding procedure \ndo not explicitly involve parallelism, which leaves flexibility \nto specific algorithms nIV. GROUP-SCHEME: A NOVEL COMPRESSION FAMILY \nBased on the general framework in Section III, we fur-\nther propose a novel family of compression algorithms, \ncalled Group-Scheme. We will first introduce the variants in \nthe Group-Scheme family, and then discuss the implementa-\ntion details. \nA. Variants in Group-Scheme family \nTo better describe the members of compression algo-\nrithms in Group-Scheme, we first introduce two terminolo-\ngies: compression granularity and length descriptor. Com-\npression granularity \(CG the minimum unit \noperated \(or allocated granularity of Elias Gamma and k-\nGamma coding is 1 bit, while as with the Variable Byte en-\ncoding, its compression granularity is 8 bits. We will also \nrefer to compression granularity as compression unit in the nrest of the paper. Length descriptor \(LD or en-\ncode compression unit of 2 bits, \nthe length descriptor of integer “458” \(111001010 in binary we need 5 compression units to represent \n10 bits in unary. \nWe consider four kinds of compression granularities for \nGroup-Scheme: 1, 2, 4 and 8 bit\(s either binary or \nunary coding, the Group-Scheme family totally has 8 differ-\nent variants, as is summarized in Table I.  \nTABLE I.  THE NUMBER OF BITS FOR LENGTH DESCRIPTORS IN GROUP-\nSCHEME FAMILY. \nDescriptor nCompression Granularity \n1 bit 2 bit 4 bits 8 bits \nBinary 5 4 3 2 \nUnary 1~32 1~16 1~8 1~4 \nB. Encoding formats and encoding/decoding procedure \n1 Group-Scheme family lies in the pattern area, and \nthey share the same format of data area, as described in sec-\ntion III. A variant algorithm first selects a type of coding \n\(binary/unary then writes length \ndescriptors into the pattern area.  \na formats \nof pattern area using binary length descriptors in Group-\nScheme family. In order to avoid the cross-byte or cross-\ndouble-byte encoding, we adopt an aligned storage way at \nthe cost of some empty bits. \n nFigure 3.  Pattern area of algorithms using binary length descriptors. The \ncompression granularity and length descriptor are denoted by CG and LD \nfor short respectively. \nb unary LD. If \nthe unary length descriptor can be stored across bytes, we \ncall it as Complete Unary, or CU for short. As a comparison, \nwe do not store data across bytes and may result in empty \nbits at the end of a byte We call it as Incomplete Unary1 or \nIU. Figure 4 shows the example of IU and CU for 4-bit com-\npression granularity. \n                                                 \n1 We follow Alexander et al.[7]’s usage of the terminologies of complete \nunary and incomplete unary to discriminate cross-byte storage and byte-\naligned storage. \n527\n \nFigure 4.  An example to compare IU and CU. \n2 we first \nfind the maximal integer value max of each four consecutive \noriginal integers, and then calculate the value of length de-\nscriptor of max. Next we store length descriptors using bi-\nnary/unary coding into the pattern area, and use sequential \nshift and mask operation to encode four integers’ lower bits \ninto four different 32-bit codewords in data area respectively. \nNext, we update the pointer of the array of 32-bit codewords \nto be written and bit offset within the 32-bit codeword \n\(usually we use an array of 32-bit integers to store code-\nwords Likewise, in the decoding proce-\ndure, we first read the length descriptor from the pattern area \nand calculate the bit length b of each integer in the data area. \nNext we loop 4 times to extract four b-bit integers \(probably \ncontaining leading zero update the pointer of 32-bit \ncodeword array to be read and the bit offset within the code-\nword. Repeat the above steps till we decode all the integers. \nIn fact, k-Gamma [2] encoding is a special case of our nGroup-Scheme family: when compression granularity is set \nto 1 bit and length descriptor is complete unary coding.  \nIn our implementation, we have considered reducing \ncondition branches that are not friendly to instruction pipe-\nlines, and try to decode a pack of bits in pattern area one time \nin order to speed up the uncovering of the length descriptors. \nThese optimization tricks yield about 50% speed up of de-\ncoding speed 


for most of algorithms in Group-Scheme. \nV. SIMD-GROUP-SCHEME \nIn this section, we will first introduce SIMD instructions \nused in our algorithm. Then we will discuss how to improve \nGroup-Scheme family by using SIMD instructions. We call \nthe SIMD-based version as SIMD-Group-Scheme. \nA. SIMD Instructions \nSIMD \(Single Instruction, Multiple Data based algorithm focuses on the commonly used SSE \n[9] on Intel-compatible processors. Instructions in SSE oper-\nate on 128-bit registers \(call XMM registers simultaneously. The \nSSE instructions used in our algorithm are as follows: \nz MOVDQA dst src:  Copy from 128-bit data source src \nto 128-bit dst. src and dst must be 16-byte aligned, and \nthey cannot be memory address at the same time. \nz MOVDQU dst src: Same as MOVDQA except that src \nand dst are allowed to be 16-byte unaligned. \nz PSRLDQ/PSLLDQ xmm1, imm8/xmm2: Regard \nxmm1 as an array of four 32-bit integers, and logically nshift each integer right/left according the value of im-\nmediate imm8 or xmm2 register. \nz PAND/POR xmm1 xmm2: execute AND/OR opera-\ntion on the two 128-bit XMM registers. \nB. SIMD Encoding and Decoding \nDue to the novel storage layout, the proposed Group-\nScheme family can be optimized by SIMD instructions easi-\nly. The encoding format and encoding/decoding procedure of \nSIMD-Group-Scheme is similar to Group-Scheme. The ma-\njor novelty is that each 4-way vertical layout of 128-bit seg-\nment in data area can be loaded into one XMM register, so \nthat we can process four 32-bit sub-segments in parallel. \nRecall in the encoding procedure of Group-Scheme, we \nhave to sequentially perform shift and mask operations for \nencoding a batch of four integers. In SIMD-Group-Scheme, \nit utilizes assemble SIMD instructions to parallelize shift and \nmask operations for four integers, yielding 3 fewer times of \nmemory addressing at a time. Furthermore, the 128-bit data \nsegment will be kept in XMM register and not be written \nback to memory until all integers in it are encoded, which \nreduces the number of memory addressing in destination \narray. Similarly, SIMD-Group-Scheme will use SIMD in-\nstructions to parallelize shift and mask operations for decod-\ning each four integers, which also reduces the number of \nmemory addressing for compressed and decompressed array. \nIn the above, we can see that the key point in paralleliza-\ntion of data processing is the use of the 128-bit XMM regis-\nters. In implementation we can further optimize the paralle-\nlized encoding and decoding by reducing XMM register-\nmemory operations. \nWe apply similar optimization tricks in section IV to \nSIMD-Group-Scheme, e.g the packed decoding method in \nuncovering the length descriptors. Likewise, we decode 4m \nintegers in data area at a time, where m>1. The above opti-\nmization tricks can yield 30-100% speed up for decoding \nspeed compared to original SIMD-Group-Scheme. \nVI. EXPERIMENTS \nIn this section, we will first introduce the experimental \nsettings and the analysis of datasets, and then evaluate the \nproposed compression algorithms with several state-of-the-\nart compression algorithms as baselines in three aspects: \nencoding rate, decoding rate and compression ratio. Here the \ncompression ratio is the ratio between the bits for the en-\ncoded integers and their original bit number, i.e. 32 bits in \nthis paper. \nA. Experimental Settings \n1 profile. Our experiments are tested on an Intel \nCore i5-3470S processor \(2.9GHz, 12MB L3 Cache RAM The operating system is 64-bit Linux of \nversion 2.6.32-71. All of the compression algorithms are nimplemented in C++ and complied using G++ 4.4.4 with the \noptimize flag “-O3”. \n2 public datasets for evaluating the \nindex and retrieval algorithms released by TREC. We \n528\npresent the basic statistics in Table II. For the two data sets, \nwe extracted the title and body field from each document, \nand then built an inverted index for each dataset respectively \nwith a search engine system implemented by our group.  \nTABLE II.  BASIC STATISTICS ON TWO DATA SETS. \n GOV2 ClueWeb09B \nPosting List Size\(MB n# Documents 25,205,179 50,220,107 \n# Terms 55,466,906 88,360,018 \n# Postings 5,249,832,053 11,975,943,513 \n Tokens\(Positions ncollection as follows: We first randomly selected 1,000 que-\nries from the TREC query set, and then extracted all the \nunique terms from these selected queries by excluding stop-\nwords. Next we extracted the d-gap sequences and TF se-\nquences from the posting lists of these selected terms and \nperform encoding/decoding operation using different com-\npression algorithms. Then we average the performance on \nthe encoding speed decoding speed and compression ratio \nover all the selected terms respectively. In the following \ntables, we denote a million integers per second by mis. \nB. Evaluation within Group-Scheme Family \nSince Group-Scheme family contains a few variants, we \nfirst compare the performance of these variants to check the \noverall performance of this family and differences among \nvariants. The algorithms are named by the following notation npattern: “ValueOfCG_ValueOfLD”, where CG can be 1,2,4 \nor 8 bits, and LD can be B, IU and CU. The experimental \nresult is shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. \nWe first compare the performance of decoding speed. For nboth the sequential implementation and SIMD-based imple-\nmentation of Group-Scheme, they perform better with larger \ncompression granularity. The major reason is larger com-\npression granularity leads to smaller 


bit-width of bi-\nnary/unary coded LD, thus decoding LD becomes faster. \nFurthermore, we can see that the SIMD based implementa-\ntion significantly outperforms the corresponding sequential \nimplementation, i.e., 40% to 110%, which indicates the ef-\nfectiveness of SIMD instructions. We also find that the \nSIMD variant with unary-coded LD is faster than the corres-\nponding SIMD variant with binary-coded LD \(e.g. SIMD-\nbased 4_CU v.s. SIMD-based 4_B SIMD-based 8_CU. \nFor the encoding speed, we have similar observations of \ndecoding speed. However, the improvement from SIMD \nversions over the sequential versions is relatively small due \nto the fact the operation of finding maximum integers and \ncalculating length descriptor values is still sequential. \nIn Figure 6, we can see with the compression granularity \nincreasing, the compression ratio gets worse. With finer CU, \nintegers in data area can be encoded more compactly and \nreduce empty bits, however, the corresponding length de-\nscriptors will take more space in pattern area. The former is \nindeed more dominant for space cost. In addition, the unary-\ncoded LD performs better than binary-coded LD on all com-\npression granularities. It indicates that for small-value integ-\ners, using variable-bit-width unary LD can save more space \nthan fixed-bit-width binary LD. \n \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1600\n1800\n2000\n1_B 2_B 4_B 8_B 4_IU 8_IU 1_CU 2_CU 4_CU 8_CU\nSp\nee\nd \n\(m\nis\n Encoding/decoding speeds on d-gaps of GOV2. \n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n1_B 2_B 4_B 8_B 4_IU 8_IU 1_CU 2_CU 4_CU 8_CU\nCo\nm\npr\nes\nsi\non\n R\nat\nio\n \nFigure 6.

The \nalgorithm with prefix “SIMD-” indicated that it has been \noptimized by SIMD instructions in encoding/decoding pro-\ncedure. \nIn Table III, we can see that our SGS_8_IU has the fast-\nest decoding speed among all the compared algorithms, in-\ncluding state-of-the-art algorithm SIMD-G8IU [7] on two nTREC datasets. SGS_8_IU also achieved very competitive \nencoding speed: the best on d-gaps and the second on TF \n\(worse than VarByte byte, there-\nfore VarByte benefits more from the datasets. The average d-\ngap value is larger than TF, and SGS_8_IU works better than \nVarByte on d-gaps. \nIn Table IV, we can find our SGS_8_IU also yields very ncompetitive compression ratio. It’s better than all variants of \nSIMD based version of Group Variable Byte 5,7] by 5%-\n20%. SGS_1_CU and SGS_2_CU perform slightly worse \nthan Rice and Gamma, but the encoding/decoding speed of \n529\nSGS_1_CU and SGS_2_CU is 6~10 times faster than Rice \nand Gamma. Furthermore, as we have expected, all the per-\nformance indicators of SGS_4_IU are in the middle of those \nbetween SGS_8_IU and SGS_1/2_CU.

Based on the framework we develop \na novel compression algorithm family, i.e. Group-Scheme, \nand present a SIMD based version of it, i.e. SIMD-Group-\nScheme. Extensive experiments on two large datasets nshowed that our algorithms have very good performance. \nThe proposed SGS_8_IU variant has faster decoding speed \nthan state-of-art SIMD-G8IU. For Group-Scheme, we find \nthat larger compression granularity variants have more com-\npetitive encoding/decoding speed, and smaller compression \ngranularity variants have more 


competitive compression \nratio while keeping high encoding/decoding speed. In the \nfuture, we will study how to apply SIMD techniques to other \nencoding algorithms in posting lists. We believe these algo-\nrithms can be parallelized with similar modification ways in \nthe paper. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive \ncomments.

For each view ?v that \napplies to a group ‘g’, its internal nodes will be bound \n\(subject, predicate, object nIt is important to note that the rewriting process is \nindependent from the policies defined, i.e. the same nconditions are always added regardless of the policies. In \nfact, the defined rewriting algorithm does not need to see the \nset of configured policies. \n3 to verify the efficiency and performance of the \nquery rewriting algorithm and the application of the policies nin terms of processing load and time, the following test has \nbeen performed: without query rewriting there were 42.199 \nstatements and, as a result of applying a query rewriting \nprocess, 212.532 statements were obtained, which is five \ntimes larger.  \nTaking into account the query execution times, it has \nbeen proved that when it takes 109 ms to execute an original \nquery, whereas it would take 697 ms to execute a rewritten nquery.  \nThe tests have been executed by means of Allegro Graph \nRDF Store Web 3.0 Database [29], which is a database and \napplication framework for building Semantic Web \napplications. \nOf course, it can be appreciated that the query rewriting \nprocess involves much more processing time \(six times more \nthan without rewriting but this is not an important issue in \nthe context of the mobile collaboration in manufacturing \nenvironments where these delays do not interfere in the \nordinary operation. The prototype evaluation shows that, \nalthough the overall performance needs to be optimized, the \ndelay introduced by our fine-grained access control is nacceptable given that data protection comes with a cost. \nE. Authorization based on XACML \nThe authorization model presented in the section before, \nbased on the creation of data views and query rewriting, was nappropriate to access information published in the semantic \nweb \(in RDF format solution proposed should not \nforget that companies do not just store information in RDF \n \n n978-1-4673-5828-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \nformat, but they also may host traditional resources such as \nbinary resources, excel sheets or text documents nenvironments, live sensor and actuator data which may be \ncontinuously changing should also be taken into nconsideration. These data are not published in an SPARQL \nendpoint; instead, its location \(its URL accessed but \nnot the RDF data itself.  \nIn these cases, in order to obtain the URL where the data \nare located \(if not previously known nAccess Server to which the data belongs, in order to obtain \nthe URL of the data. After going through the SPARQL query \nrewriting algorithm, the URL will be provided to the mobile \napplication. Once the URL is known a classic HTTPS \nrequest will be launched to the DAS in order to obtain the \ndesired value.  So as to authorize the access to the concrete \nvalues requested, traditional XACML access control \napproach will be implemented. \nFulfilling the needs of distributed architectures, the \nXACML architecture [30] addressed in the proposed security \napproach logically separates the access components \nresponsible for policy definition policy enforcement and \npolicy evaluation. The Policy Enforcer will form a request \nbased on the requester's attributes, the resource in question, \nthe action \(read/write the request \(such as time of the day nwhich will look at the request, find some XACML policy \nthat applies to the request, and come up with an answer about \nwhether the access should be granted. That answer is \nreturned to the Policy Enforcer, which will then allow or \ndeny access to the requester.  \n \nIV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper it has been defined a new fine-grained \naccess control approach for secure mobile collaboration \nthrough Linked Data in the context of the Web of Data \napplied to manufacturing. In a nutshell, so as to cover all the \nsecurity needs that may arise from this mobile collaboration \nenvironment, a security framework which will combine, on nthe one hand, the creation of data views and SPARQL query \nrewriting algorithms and, on the other traditional XACML \naccess control has been defined. \nThe next step is to develop an integrated prototype based non the presented design. Once the development of the \nprototype has been completed, it will be investigated if the \nmock-up meets the objectives or if further iterations of \ndesign, development and reflection are required. In fact, the \nsecurity model will be refined and improved so far in order \nto extend its scope from a mock-up to a functional prototype.  \nFuture testing campaign will be carried out to provide a \nthorough evaluation with other SPARQL query engines, \nsuch as Virtuoso, Sesame or Jena. \nFuture work includes similarly to the rewriting of \nqueries, the analysis of the query results, whether they \ncontain confidential 


information, that is, to address also a \ncontent-based access control.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe research leading to these results was funded by the \nEuropean Community's Seventh Framework Programme \nunder grant agreement no.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
