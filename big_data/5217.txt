In this paper, we first use the cloud model to dynamically divide attribute value to overcome the shortcoming that the concept was partitioned by experience and then explore the application of cloud models in mining association rules from credit card database by the improved Apriori algorithm. The result of experiment shows that the method is effective and flexible in holding uncertainties. By 
analyzing cloud association rules, valuable advice can be provided for the commercial banks to implement personalized marketing Keywords-cloud model; association rules; apriori algorithm; marketing I   I NTRODUCTION  In large relational database, it is difficult and unnecessary to find the relationship among the attributes at the primary level, because there are lots of distinct values for numerical attribute. People usually concern about the association rules at high concept level, such as the relationship of education level and incoming H o w e ve r   in practice the partition of the concept is often designated by people, the result is identical at any occasion. It can not reflect people’s different view at the same thing. The cloud 
is a method of describing uncertain problem. It comprehensively considers randomness and fuzziness, can be used interchangeably to bridge the gap between quantitative and qualitative. So if we use the cloud  model to dynamically divided attribute value , the shortcoming that the concept was partitioned by experience will be overcome At present, the cloud theory has been widely applied in many fields, such as the partition of fuzzy region in image processing, comprehensive evaluation of shooting athletes, association rules and prediction, etc[2 3   4    Thus, the cloud model is presented to mine association rules in the paper. First of all, we use a set of 1-D cloud model to dynamically divide every attribute value Secondly, the credit card database are further scanned by the improved Apriori Algorithm, to find out all cloud 
association rules which have support and confidence greater than user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence respectively. Finally, the customers consuming awareness and tendency are summarized based on the analysis of the cloud association rules, to implement personalized marketing and provide different services for the credit card customers  II  C LOUD M ODEL  The Cloud is brought forward by Prof. De-yi Li. It is the uncertain switch model between the qualitative concept and its expression of number with uncertainty and randomness [7   T h e  c l o ud i s  c o m p o s e d  o f m a ny o f c l o ud drops. A drop is one-time value of qualitative concept. The total cloud reflects the radical character of fuzzy concept 
U\(the universe of discourse\s defined as U  u   T is the language value related to U The degree of pertain which is called as C T  u the degree that u belongs to U The number feature of cloud is signified with the expected value, entropy and hyper entropy. So the cloud model is recorded as A  Ex,En,He he expected value Ex is the center value of the concept. The entropy En is defined by the bandwidth of the MEC mathematical expected curve\ the normal cloud showing how many elements in the universe of discourse could be accepted The MEC of the normal cloud is defined by the following 
formula  2 2 2   exp   n x A E E u u MEC    1 The entropy He is the uncertain degree of cloud drop If the number characteristics Ex  En and He of the cloud are given, the following algorithm can be used to produce normal clou 002 1 002 The normal random number x i is calculated by the following formula     n x i E E 
G x  2 002 2 002 Then the normal random number  i n E is created with the entropy En and the standard deviation He by the following formula      He E G E n n i  3 002 3 002Å\002 x i 002 002\035 i 002 is viewed as cloud drop 002\035 i is calculated by the following formula i n x i i E E 
x 2  2 2   exp     4 The above algorithm can be implemented in both hardware and software, which is named as cloud gene i g u r e1 sh o w s a 1D forward cloud generator. Correspondingly, given six digital characteristics Ex,En x He x Ey,En y and He y to represent a two-dimensional linguistic atom, the 2D cloud generator could produce any number of drops of clouds.

Let D be a set of transactions called the database   Each transaction T in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I A rule is defined as an implication of the form X 000 Y where X 002 I  Y 002 I and X 003 Y 004 The sets of items X and Y are called antecedent left-hand-side or LHS nd consequent \(right-hand-side or RHS f the rule respectively[10 1\t and confidence The support of the rule X 000 Y is defined as the proportion of transactions in the database D that contain X 005 Y      Y X P Y X SUPP 005  000 5 The confidence of the rule X 000 Y is defined as the proportion of transactions in the database D that contain X  also contain Y           X Y P X SUPP Y X SUPP Y X conf  005  000 6 We usually use the constraints which is minimum thresholds on support and confidence to select interesting rules from the set of all possible rules 2\ frequent  itemset A set of item is called as itemset 002 kitemset denotes an itemset including k items. An itemset with a support 0011  the minimum support threshold is called a frequent itemset  L k  denotes a set of  frequent kitemset Given a database of D the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have support and confidence greater than user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence respectively To achieve this, association rule generation is a two-step process. First, minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database. In the second step, these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules B  Cloud Association Rules Cloud association rule[3 is a n as s o c i at ion  ru le w h ich  is generated based on the division of the attribute domain by using cloud model Let D  t 1 t 2 t n be a database and I  i 1 i 2 i m  denote the set of attributes where t j indicates the j th record of T and t j  i k  is th e v a lu e  o f it s at tri b u t e i k  We assume that the definition domain ik F of the attribute i k can be divided into many concepts by cloud model. And hence we have     2 1 l ik ik ik ik f f f F   j i k f denote the j th category in k i F The symbols j i k Ex  j i k En and j i k He  represent the digital characteristic of the concept j i k f  Let X and Y be the subset of I  X and Y denote as       and       2 1 2 1 q p y y y Y x x x X   with 006  003 Y X  Supposing that i x f  i 1,2 p  i y f  j 1,2 q he concept of the attribute x i and y i in the universe of discouse, the set A is the form of     2 1 xp x x f f f A  Similarly the set B is the form of     2 1 yq y y f f f B  Let B A C Y X Z 005  005   and then the cloud association rules we discussed are following the form that if X 001\031 A then Y 001\031 B  IV  A PRIORI A LGORITHM BASED ON C LOUD M ODEL  The Apriori algorithm p r op os e d  by R  A g raw a l i n  1994 is one of the most effective data mining algorithms for mining frequent itemset in transactional database. This algorithm repeats a level-wise method to mining frequent itemsets. The essential idea is to iteratively generate the frequent k 1\-itemsets from the set of frequent k itemsets for k 0011 1\. First of all, the frequent 1 itemsets are picked out, denoted as L 1 Secondly generate the set of candidate itemsets C k 2 with 2 items from L 1 and then the frequent 2itemsets L 2 are generated by checking candidate itemsets Repeat this process until no new frequent k itemsets can be found For a given database D 002 the mining of the cloud association rules are to find out the fuzzy association rules which have support and confidence greater than userspecified minimum support and minimum confidence respectively by the improved Apriori algorithm, after dividing the definition domain of attributes in the database D by the cloud model. The steps of Apriori algorithm[2  can be described as the following Input 002 the transaction database D 002 minimum support threshold min_sup  Output 002 all of frequent itemset in D  L 1 find_frequent_ 1 itemsets\(D 002  for k 2 002 L k-1 006 007  002 k   C k apriori_gen L k-1 002 min_sup  002   CG  drop u i 002\035 i  Ex  En He  drop x i y i 002\035 i  CG E y E ny He y Ex  Enx He x  drop u i 002\035 i  E x  En He CG 1  drop x i y i 002\035 i  E y E ny He y Ex  Enx He x  CG 1

And We selected 237 credit card customers from the database The analyzing data is described in the Table I Since the attributes are numerical and categorical in the Table I, it is impossible to discover strong association rules with the Apriori algorithm at the primary level directly The attributes, not only numerical attributes but also the nominal and categorical attributes, can be generalized to multiple concept levels with the cloud model. So it is preferable to generalize the attributes first and then mine rules with the generalized data For instance, the attribute Age is numerical type in the Table I, should be generalized by using 1D forward and backward generator. Therefore the attribute Age can be partitioned into five ranges: A 1 18, A 2 23, A 3 3540  A 4 41 A 5 60 and above  Si m i l a rl y  a c c ord i ng t o  our country present situation, the incoming will also be divided into four scopes in the same way :W1 003\036 3000 above  W 2  003\036 2000\003\036 300 W 3  003\036 1000\003\036 20  W 4  003\036 1000 below   In addition, the attribute of career is categorical, which should to be generalized according to the actual situation Hence, its domain can be classified into seven types ,denoted as following O 1 Public Servant O 2 Teacher, Doctor O 3 Lawyer,Finance Practitioner O 4 Military, Journalist O 5 Enterpriser, Clerk O 6 Student O 7 Others}. The attribute of education is the same as career. So it can be classified into five types in the same way X 1 Master and above X 2 Bachelor  X 3 College X 4 Technical School, High School X 5 Others}. Parts of transformed data are shown in the Table II We assign minimum support threshold and the minimum confidence threshold 10% and 80% respectively Five association rules are generated with the improved Apriori algorithm based on the normal cloud model. The rules can be described in the Table III The first rule indicates that the expenditure pattern of consumers is E5F1 if education is “post-graduate degree or above”. The confidence of this rule is 87.4% and the support is 23.2 And the 5th rule shows if education is “post-graduate degree or above”, occupation is “teacher or doctor”, and incoming exceeds 3000, then the probability that expenditure pattern of consumers is  E5F1  is  80.5%. The support of this rule is 12.8 Based on the analysis of the above association rules we can draw a conclusion that the bank should pay more attention to the customers whose expenditure pattern is E5F1. This kind of customers is usually well-educated, and their work and incoming are relatively stable. According to their consumption demand, mainly including housing automobile, education and so on, the products supplied for them should be primarily consisted of the personal credit class. And the bank should provide fast, convenient service for them in order to increase customer satisfaction VI  C ONCLUSION  In the paper, we firstly use the cloud model for data preprocessing in mining association rules, then adopt the improved Apriori Algorithm to mine association rules in a large credit card transaction database at high concept level The result of experiment shows that this approach combining the cloud model based on generalization method with Apriori algorithm, is superior to the conventional method in holding uncertainties. Furthermore based on the analysis of the cloud association rules, we can find the relation of customer’s consumption behavior and their attributes, such as education, incoming, age occupation and summarize the different types of customers’ consuming awareness and tendency in order to carry on the personalized marketing and provide the differentiated service for the credit card customers R EFERENCES  1  Luo Jiawei,Peng Manman etal.

numerical attribute e  g the attribute Age which is generally in the range 0-100, can be divided into six sharp partitions namely 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75, 76 and above. In case of FACISME, fuzzy sets are used instead of sharp partitions, in order to convert numerical attributes to fuzzy partitions. The attribute Age can be divided into three fuzzy partitions, namely Young, Medium-aged, and Old, with each value of age belonging to each of the three fuzzy partitions with some membership value 265 Thus, the number of sharp partitions that need to be used to handle a numerical attribute is far greater than the number of fuzzy partitions required to do the same. Moreover, this leads to better understanding by the user as there are few well-defined fuzzy partitions with linguistic names/meanings like Young and Old, as opposed to sharp partitions which are less intuitive and to which a user cannot relate to immediately For the current analysis we have used two fuzzy partitions for all numerical attributes throughout all the datasets. As described in section 5.C, the time complexity of FACISME is quite high, because of which the time required to train a fuzzy classifier using FACISME is also high. Hence, we have used two fuzzy partitions so as to limit the training time. But, even with just two fuzzy partitions we have achieved quite high accuracies, as described above. More importantly, even with this, we achieved similar \(sometimes better results\s other state-of-the art classifiers used in this experimental analysis. The reason for these high accuracies is that FACISME is based on the theoretically sound and well-established maximum entropy framework  VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have proposed a new classifier based on the paradigms of association rules mining and fuzzy logic  Though recent classifiers i nvolving association rules have shown their techniques to be accurate, their approaches to build a classifier either manifest unobserved statistical relationships in the dataset, or have no statistical basis at all FACISME uses the well-known maximum entropy principle and iterative scaling to build a statistical and robust theoretical model for classification Fuzzy Logic gives FACISME the capability to deal accurately and efficiently  with any type of datasets and domains, and in any kind of environments, which is not necessarily true for traditional crisp classifiers. Thus, using maximum entropy and fuzzy logic, FACISME provides very  good  accuracy and can work with all types of data irrespective of size and type of attributes \226 numerical or binary  REFERENCES 1  Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R.: Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
