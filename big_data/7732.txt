A Dynamic Description Logic-based Formalism for RBAC  Li Ma, Shilong Ma, Jianghua Lv Department of Computer Science Beihang University Beijing 100191, China E-mail: {mali, slma, jhlv@nlsde.buaa.edu.cn  Yuefei Sui  Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100190, China E-mail: yfsui@ict.ac.cn   Abstract  Applications in the open and dynamic environment become more intelligent and complicated. To secure these applications is a big challenge. RBAC model, as a de facto standard in access control field, is widely used in many applications. But the lack of dynamic and formal method to describe RBAC makes the model can’t completely adapt to the open and dynamic environment. To solve this problem, we introduce a three level RBAC model which unifies the administrative components, the administrative actions and the regular RBAC components, and also proposes a dynamic description logic, called DDL RBAC to formalize the three level model. Based on the formal description of RBAC with DDL RBAC an executable action decision algorithm to guarantee the dynamic consistency of systems is also presented  Keywords-Role-Based Access Control; Action; Dynamic Description Logic I  I NTRODUCTION  As applications become more sophisticated and intelligent in open and dynamic environment, they require greater degrees of decision making and autonomy. A new challenge is to secure these applications in open, dynamic environments [1  B e cau s e of  p o l i cy n eu tral an d  s i m p lic ity  of administration, RBAC [2,3 a s  be en  reg a r d e d as on e of  the most suitable access control models and de facto standard to secure dynamic environment [4,5 H o w e v e r, R B A C its elf  can’t adapt to completely the open and dynamic environment. Three problems occur in relating RBAC to dynamic environment The first issue is that there is no dynamic RBAC model that completely meets the need of the dynamic environment The security policy that is enforced is a consequence of the detailed configuration of various components of basic RBAC model [6  In  th e op en an d dy n a m i c en v i r o n m en t, ac ces s  control policies of applications are also dynamic, which makes the components of RBAC easy to change. The administration of RBAC can ensure that policies do not drift away from their original objectives. Therefore, we need a dynamic RBAC model to integrate the basic RBAC model with the administration model to not only protect dynamic applications, but also ensure the consistency of the changing configuration with security policies.  While, some widelyused RBAC model, such as RBAC96 [2 ST R B AC 3  and most of other extended RBAC model, such as GTRBAC 4 c a nnot pro v i d e e ffi c i e n t a u t hor i z a t i o n m a na ge m e nt  for dynamic environment The second issue is that there is a limitation of expressive power for RBAC. The open, dynamic environment needs different partners or agents to collaborate and share information [7,8 F r o m th e s ecu r ity asp e ct if  p a rtn e rs h a v e  different understanding with the sharing information, the new security problem will be produced. So we need a semantic-based, formal and shareable access control specification to be described over the heterogeneous domain data and improve the common understanding among participants who might not use the same information model However, RBAC model was originally designed for enterprise environment that handled homogeneous users and services, and the specification of the current RBAC is based on mathematical notation, which is burdensome in modeling a complex computing environment [7    The third problem is to enable effective automation of various administrative actions related security activities. We need an approach to model and reason about the administrative actions as well as the authorization of such actions. The existing formal ways, such as graph-based formalism [9  o n l y e xpr e ss t h e sy st e m s c o nsi s t e nc y und er the transformation of actions, with no consideration of the authorization, which is not complete to express such actions In order to solve the problems above, we propose a three level RBAC model that unifies the RBAC itself administration, the administration actions, and the basic RBAC model. To represent the RBAC model, we notice that Description logics \(DLs n pro v i d e a f o r m a l m e t hod to describe RBAC and reasoning mechanism. However traditional description logics can only describe static RBAC model, we need a dynamic description logic to represent the three level RBAC model. The dynamic description logic in this paper, which is called DDL RBAC is proposed on the basis of description logic language ALC dynamic logic, and action theory II  T HREE LEVEL RBAC MODEL  The three level RBAC of this section is based on RBAC96 model w h i c h d i s t i n gu i s h e s regu l a r rol e s an d  administrative roles, where the former is used to control the access to data and resources of system, and the latter is used to control the administration of RBAC itself. To describe the dynamic properties of RBAC, we assume that regular roles and permissions can be modified by administrative actions, while the administrative roles and permissions are relatively unchanged and static for we don’t consider the

administration of the administrative roles and permissions Thus we can define a basic RBAC model as follows Definition 1 Basic RBAC model M 1 is a 11-tuple  U  R  P  S  UA  PA  RH  user  roles  perms  Cons  where U  R  P and S is the set of users, regular roles regular permissions, and user sessions, respectively UA  U  R is user to role assignments \(if u  r   UA then u is the member of r  PA  P  R permission to role assignments RH  R  R partial relations on the role hierarchy user  S   U mapping each session s to a user \(unchanged with time roles  S  2 R  roles  s    r   r  r  user  s  r   UA  perms  S  2 P  perms  s   r  roles  s   p   r  r  p  r    PA  Cons is a collection of constraints stip ulating which values of the various components enumerated above are allowed or forbidden Administration of RBAC involves control over each of those regular components, so we define the administrative model as follows Definition 2 RBAC administrative model M 2 is a 11tuple  AU  AR  AP  AS  AUA  APA  ARH  user  roles  perms  Cons  where AU  AR  AP  AS is the set of administrative users roles, permissions and administrative session, respectively for the set of regular roles R and P we have R  AR  and P  AP   AUA  AU  AR administration user to administration role assignment APA  AP  AR  administration permission to administration role assignment ARH  AR  AR partial relations on the administration role hierarchy \(we can also use   user  AS  AU mapping each session as to an administrator unchangeable in a life time roles  AS  2 AR mapping each session as to the set roles  as    ar   ar  ar   user  s  ar   AUA Each session as has the permission perms  as   ar  roles  as   ap   ar   ar  ap  ar    APA  Cons is a collection of constraints Remark To clearly explain, we use the authority rules in ARBAC97 model as our administrative permissions, such as can_assign 6  The whole RBAC model can be described as three levels: 1\ The first level is administration level, including AU  AP  AR  ARH  APA  AUA and so on; 2\he second level is administrative action level, including all of the administrative actions, such as assign and revoke and 3\ the third level, basic RBAC component level, including U  R  P  UA  PA  RH  S  users  roles  perms and Cons which can be changed by the second level III   D YNAMIC DESCRIPTION LOGIC FOR RBAC Here we propose a dynamic description logic for RBAC called DDL RBAC which is based on the basic description logic ALC and it’s extension  10,11 d each action a can be taken as a modality a   This section will introduce the syntax and semantics of DDL RBAC   A  Syntax of DDL RBAC  The language of DDL RBAC  L contains the following symbols: object constants c 0  c 1 atomic object concepts A 0  A 1 object roles R 0  R 1 object concept constructors      012 inclusion relation atomic actions a 0  a 1  action roles Q 0  Q 1 logic connectors    and, role constructors    Definition 3 Object concept C is defined as C  A    C  C 1  C 2  012 R  C  a  C  where a is an action Definition 4 Object statement  is defined as   C  c  R  c 1  c 2  C 1 C 2  R 1 R 2      1   2  a   3  where  3 is a statement that contains no modalities Definition 5 For any action a we have the following form of action rule    a    where  and  are object statements, which stands for the precondition and effect of action a   Definition  6 DDL RBAC knowledge base KB is a triple  TBox  ABox  RBox here TBox is a set of non-atomic statement that contains no modalities ABox is a set of atomic statements RBox is a set of statements formed by    a   where  and  contain no modalities B  Semantics of DDL RBAC  Definition 7 The semantic model of DDL RBAC  M is a 5-tuple W  R a  a 015    015  I here  W is a set of possible worlds  for each a 015  R a  W  W is reachable relations on a  and for any w  W there is at most one w  W such that w  w   R a    is a non-empty set  015 is a non-empty set, such that 015   and  I is an interpretation, such that  for every constant symbol c  I  c     for each possible world w  W and atomic concept A  I  A  w   satisfying that for any w  W with w  w   R a for some a 015  I  A  w  I  A  w inite, where is the symmetric difference, i.e X Y  X Y   Y X d I  A  w  I  A  w  x   x  I  A  w  x  I  A  w   for each possible world w  W and role symbol R  I  R  w   2 satisfying that for any w  W  with w  w   R a for some a 015  I  R  w  I  R  w inite, where I  R  w  I  R  w   x  y   2  x  y   I  R  w   x  y   I  R  w   for each atomic action role Q  I  Q  015  Remark In DDL RBAC action a can only change parts of RBAC components.

In the next section, we will give a representation of RBAC in DDL RBAC  IV  R EPRESENTATION OF RBAC IN DDL RBAC  We use a language for the description logic for RBAC which consists of three sub-languages L 0 for the administration specification L 1 for the description of administrative actions; and L 2 for the description of basic RBAC state. Since there are many administrative actions, to simplify the description, we only consider action assign and revoke Obviously assign and revoke can only change the UA relation A  Administration of RBAC To every administrative model M 2 since we don’t consider the changing of administrative components, we can use the static part of DDL RBAC to describe the administration. The language L 0 contains the following symbols  constants au for each administrative user au  AU  ar for each administrative role ar  AR  and ap for each administrative permission ap  AP   atomic concepts U  AU  R  AR  P  AP  AS   atomic roles AUA  APA  ARH  user  roles  perms  where 1 U  AU  R  AR  P  AP and AS satisfy the following axioms \(only parts of axioms listed here AU   U R  AR  P  AP  AS    AR   AU U  R  P  AP  AS    AP   U  AU R  P  AR  AS    2 AUA  APA and ARH satisfy the following axioms  AUA  AR AU   APA  AR AP   ARH  AR AR  3 user  roles and perms satisfy the following axioms respectively  user  AU AS   roles  AR AS   perms  AP AS  Definition 10 Statement  0 can be defined as follows  0  AU  au  AR  ar  AUA  au  ar  ARH  ar  ar  AP  ap    0   0 1   0 2  where ARH  ar  ar tands for ar    ar  In the ARBAC97 model, administrative permissions are defined as can-authorities, such as can_assign If we use the same way to define administrative permissions, we can use a concept Can assign to represent the kind of can_assign rule to substitute AP If we use c to stand for the rule can_assign  ar  t  r here ar is a administrative role t is a prerequisite condition, and r is the role to be assigned, then we can use the following statement to describe each administrative permission, for example Can assign  c  assignBy can  c  ar  assignWith can  c  r d assignCon can  c  t  represent c is a can authority, the administrative role that can execute the action is ar the role to be assigned is r and the prerequisite condition is t   respectively B  RBAC administrative action description The language L 1 of describing administrative actions contains the following symbols  action constants assign 0  assign 1  revoke 0  revoke 1   atomic action roles assignedBy  assignedTo  assignedWith  revokedBy  revokedWith  where assignedBy describes the executer of the assignment assignedTo describes the user to be assigned to assignedWith describes the role to be assigned revokedBy  describes the executer of the revocation revokedWith  describes the role to be revoked Definition 11 Statement  1 in L 1 can be defined as follows  1  assignedBy  assign  au  assignedTo  assign  u   assignedWith  assign  r  revokedBy  revoke  au  revokedWith  revoke  r    1   1 1   1 2  where assign and revoke stand for actions C  RBAC state description We will represent the dynamic behavior of RBAC by the transformation of RBAC state. Then there is a RBAC state S corresponding to the basic RBAC model M 1 at any instance.

Let S be a state of RBAC relative model is M 1  U  R  S  P  UA  PA  RH  user  roles  perms  mutuallyexclusive uppose there is a description logic language L 2 the definition of transformation  that transfers a consistent RBAC state to KB 2 is as Table I TABLE I  D EFINITION OF   Symbols, relations and constraints in S The corresponding symbols in KB 2  For each u  U  r  R  s  S  p  P    u  u     r  r    s  s    p  p where u  r  s  p  L 2 U  R  P   U  U    R  R    P  P  UA  PA  RH   UA  UA    PA  PA    RH  RH  user  roles    user  user    roles  roles  mutuallyexclusive   mutuallyexclusive  mutuallyexclusive  u  U  s  S    u  U  U  u     s  S  S  s    u  r   UA    u  r   UA  UA  u  r   r  roles  s     r  roles  s  roles  s  r   u  user  s     u  user  s  user  s  u    r  r   mutuallyexclusive     r  r   mutuallyexclusive  mutuallyexclusive  r  r   To the statements    1  S, if      1      1     1      1   2     1   2     1       2     roles  s    r   r  r   user  s  r   UA        roles    user UA  RH     perms  s  p  012 r  roles  s   r  r  p  r   PA       perms  roles  RH PA   Remark We introduce only parts of the definition here Constraints are very important in RBAC to enforce various access control policies. Each RBAC system is consistent only if it meets its constraint conditions. The literature [12 listed so m e c o n s is ten c y ru le s ab o u t RB AC  state. If the state is not consistent after executing an action i.e KB 2    this action is not executable, which can be decided by the decision algorithm. To show the effectiveness of the algorithm, we have the following theorem  Theorem 1 For any RBAC state S and assignment or revocation action a let a  e n e w  s t ate a f ter e x ecu t i ng a then there is the following relation   a    a   S where  S\sformation from S to KB 2  Proof: \(1\f a is an assigning action, i.e., administrator au assigns role r to a user u let S is a state, and a  is  another state, where all of the components of a  e  same with S, except that UA  a S  UA S   u  r here UA  stands for the set of user-role assignment of u  Let a  t an ds f o r t h e m odal i t y o f  a According to the definition of    S\s a knowledge base of DDL RBAC  According to the assigning rule  UA  u  r    a  UA  u  r  we have a   S  S   UA  u  r d   a    S     u  r   S   UA  u  r  a   S 2 a is a revoking action, i.e., administer au revokes r  from u let S be a state, and b  oth e r s t ate w h ere al l of the components of b  e s a m e  w i t h S, ex cept th a t  UA  b S  UA S  u  r  According to the revoking rule UA  u  r    a   UA  u  r we have a   S  S UA  u  r  and   a    S   u  r   S UA  u  r  a   S Theorem 1 indicates that we can use representation of RBAC with DDL to analyze the dynamic consistency of RBAC and predict the executable of an administrative action: if KB 2 is not consistent after execution, then the action can not be executed Example 2 Suppose pe 1  and pe 2 are mutually exclusive roles Bob is a member of both pe 1 and e 1 Alice  can also assign Bob the pe 2. But if Bob is already a member of pe 1, then the assignment action of assigning Bob the pe 2  is not executable. Let b stands for the action of Alice  assigning Bob s pe 2 membership.

Then we can add the UA  Bob  pe 2\o KB 2 If there is a SSD constraint axiom \(*\n KB 2 and obviously UA  Bob  pe 1\d UA  Bob  pe 2  can’t hold at the same time in KB 2  so this action is not executable  B  Comparison There are many description of dynamic aspect of RBAC, such as ARBAC d NIS T R B A C 3], an d Koch’s graph formalism [9 th is sectio n   w e  w ill  compare DDL RBAC with those representations The ARBAC97 model is authority-oriented, which consists of the can_actions, such as can_assign  can_revoke  etc., restricting the actions acting on the components of an RBAC state; The NIST RBAC model is action-oriented which directly consists of a set of actions, such as AddActiveRole The ARBAC97 model has the administrative roles and administrative permissions, as well as users, roles and permissions; the NSIT RBAC model has only the users, roles and permissions. The administrative part of ARBAC97 model is omitted in the NIST RBAC model. The three-level DDL RBAC model describes both the authorities and actions, so DDL RBAC has the features of both ARBAC97 and NIST RBAC. Koch’s graph-based formalism describes the state transformation of an action which is also contained in DDL RBAC We can compare these different representations in Table II TABLE II   T HE DIFFERENT REPRESENTATION OF ADMINISTRATION OF RBAC Description ARBAC9 7  NIST RBAC  Graph formalism DDL RBAC  Actions No Yes No Yes Action’s Authority Yes No No Yes Execution conditions No Yes Yes Yes Administrativ e mode Yes static Yes dynamic Yes dynamic Yes dynamic Remark We use “Yes” or “No” to describe whether the model has or has no such description  Both Koch’s formalism and DDL RBAC consider the state transformation. Koch’s method uses graph rule to change a RBAC state and guarantee the system’s consistency. And the graph rule can be changed by embodying the constraint rules before the graph rule can be used. Similar to Koch’s transformation, DDL RBAC has transformation rules, i.e action rules. But the aim of DDL RBAC is different from that of graph formalism, for it tries to predict the action is executable or not by integrating the constraint rules into to the description of states. So in Koch’s way, the state of RBAC contains only some basic components, such as u  r  s  p and their relations, without any constraints There are many other formal descriptions for RBAC including description logic appr oaches [13 Sin ce m o s t of these methods try to describe the basic RBAC model, which is obviously different from DDL RBAC the comparison is omitted here VI  C ONCLUSION  The approach presented in this article proposes a framework of describing the authorities, actions and basic RBAC model, and has the expressive power of both ARBAC97 and NIST RBAC. By integrating the constraints into the description of basic RBAC state, this approach can predict the actions’ executability, which means the consistency properties of RBAC system can be guaranteed A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation grant nos. 60273019, 60496326, 60573063, and 60573064\d the National 973 Programme \(grants no 2005CB321902  R EFERENCES  1  T.

   7              Figure 6-3 Ball fingerprint on the race of wear track                Figure 6-4 Ball fingerprint on the race of oxidative wear  6.2 Feature Space  The vibration data shown in Figure 6-1 is used to construct the feature space. Both Shan non entropy and infinity-norm of random covariance matrix are estimated. Figure 6-5 shows the DoR measures together with the vibration data and related friction data. In this figure, the third plot shows the temporal trend of Shannon entropy and the bottom plot is the temporal trend of random covariance matrix inf-norm  It can be observed that both Shannon entropy and random covariance matrix inf-norm have accurately captured the bearing fault evolution. Alth ough the four stages are not  clear in the vibration data, they are clearly observable in the  DoR trends. Moreover, the trend shapes of Shannon entropy and random covariance matrix inf-norm are very similar which indicates that the random covariance matrix inf-norm can be used as an effective measure of randomness of random variables  Since randomness of Fault C is relatively similar to the randomness of Fault A and Fault B, we only construct three feature vectors associated with Normal, Fault A and Fault B In fact, based on tribological an alysis, the stage of Fault C is directly related to bearing failure. In other words, when the bearing is in the stage of Fau lt C, the system can no longer operate appropriately                            Figure 6-5 Temporal trend of Shannon entropy 3 rd and inf-norm of random covariance matrix bottom\imated from the vibration data \(top The four stages of bearing faults can be clearly seen in the DoR trends  Figure 6-6 shows three cluste rs in the feature space which are associated with three bearin g stages. It can be observed that these three clusters are well separated, which indicates that the features made of Shannon entropy and random covariance matrix infinity-norm can be used to identify the fault stages of the ball bearing. However, the Fault C cluster is missing, which makes it impossible to classify this stage based on clusters. In our monitoring algorithms, we use GM-HMM to infer this fault stage             Figure 6-6 Feature space with three well-separated feature clusters associated with fault modes  


   8 6.3 Fault Classification Using GM-HMM  We have applied 10% of the data shown in Figure 6-1 for the training of a GM-HMM. Three separate GM-HMMs were trained, each representing one stage  Normal, Fault A or Fault B. They were then fused to generate the final states from the complete model. We then applied all of the data including training data\o the  trained GM-HMM. The state transitions are shown in Figure 67. In this figure, the four fault states are obtained from the analysis of randomness of the signal \(see Figure 6-5                    Figure 6-7 Classification of GM-HMM using the feature space shown in Figure 6-6  From Figure 6-7, we make the following observations  1  GM-HMM made the correct transition from 223Normal\224 to \223Fault A\224. Th ere is a small transient transition period in which states \223Normal\224 and 223Fault A\224 alternate frequently. This phenomenon makes physical sense since mechanical system changes states gradually  2  After the transient tran sition from \223Normal\224 to 223Fault A\224, the bearings are in \223Fault A\224 state. As the bearings are wearing out gradually, they start a  long transition period with states varying among 223Normal\224, \223Fault A\224 and \223Fault B\224  3  Bearing stay at \223Fault B\224 fo r a long period of time  4  As bearings continue wearing out, they enter in a new state which is not modeled by GM-HMM during the training phase. One can see that the states vary between \223Fault A\224 and \223Fault B\224 Based on the tribological analysis, data in this region are associated with bearing failure or \223notuseable\224 stage. Although our GM-HMM does not provide a new state for this region of data, it can clearly be inferred through the frequent transitions between two fault states, \223Fault A\224 and \223Fault B\224  In many industrial applications, the data related to machinery failure are difficult, if not impossible, to get. It is practically important to infer the failure state using nonfailure data. The results shown in Figure 6-7 clearly indicate that GM-HMM can be used to predict bearing failures without actually using the failure data C ONCLUSIONS  We present a feasibility analysis for the development of an online ball bearing fault detection and identification method which can effectively identify va rious fault stages related to the dynamics of vibration related to the contact in the coated ball bearings. To detect the ball bearing faulty stages, we have developed a new degree of randomness \(DoR\nalysis methodology using Shannon entropy and random matrix theory. Test results have shown that DoR can be used to detect the small abnormal tran sient signals associated with the bearing friction and wear evolution. To identify the fault stages, we have further developed a set of stochastic models using hidden Markov model \(HMM\ theory. Instead of using the discrete sequences, our HMM can incorporate the feature vectors modeled as Gaussian mixtures. To facilitate online fault identification, we build a HMM for each fault stage. At each evaluation time, all models are evaluated and the final health determination is refined based on individual detections. Test results using laboratory experiment data have shown that our system can identify coated ball bearing faults in near real-time  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The work is supported by NASA STTR Phase II funding under contract NND08AA57C.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
