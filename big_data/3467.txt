I I NTRODUCTION Data mining and machine learning techniques have found increasingly more successful applications to a wide range 
of real world problems involving huge amount of data Such data are often characterized as heterogeneous dynamic and noisy in nature and extremely large in volume The success of data mining applications depends critically on the development of 
learning and knowledge discovery algorithms because the sheer size of data in many real world scenarios renders the traditional data mining methods impractical We believe that sampling techniques can make important contributions to scalable learning and knowledge discovery Therefore it is desirable to study smart sampling methods and apply such methods to build scalable learning algorithms This paper is motivated from such a perspective 
scalable 
Statisticians have studied extensively sampling techniques and parametric estimation problems There is a vast literature in statistics on this topic In machine learning researchers use sampling to estimate the accuracy of learned classiﬁers or to estimate features characteristic of vast amount of data Random sampling is an important technique widely used in statistical analysis computer science machine learning and knowledge discovery A key issue in designing a sampling scheme is to determine 
 the number of sampled instances sufﬁcient to assure the estim ation accuracy and conﬁdence Well-known theoretical bounds such as the Chernoff bound 
sample size 
and Hoeffding bound are commonly used for this purpose Sample size could be determined a priori as in conventional 
sampling or it could be determined as in sampling As recent studies 16 poi nt ed out  t here are s i t u at i ons i n whi c h u s i ng C h er noff/Hoeffding bounds in static non-adaptive sampling would require a sample size that is unnecessarily large In contrast adaptive sampling decides whether it has seen sufﬁcient samples based on some criterion related to the samples seen so far This adaptive nature of sequential 
batch dynamically adaptive sequential 
sampling method is attractive from both computational and practical perspectives Earlier works in Computer Science on adaptive sampling include the methods in 11   12  13  for estimating the size of a database query Adaptive sampling is also closely related to 
1 In recent works on 7 8  15  16  W a tanabe et al proposed techniques for adaptive sampling and applied the methods to boosting an ensemble learning method These works illustrated that adaptive sampling techniques can make important contributions to speed up and scale up ensemble learning which typically requires much computation because of the need to construct the 
active learning Madaboost 
with many classiﬁers In a recent work a ne w a dapti v e s equential s ampling method based on adaptive application of the Chernoff bound was developed that can handle cases of controlling absolute error and relative error Empirical results were shown in 5 i ndi cat i n g t hat t he ne w s ampl i n g met hod us es s i gni  cantly lower sample size compared to the method in 16 We have further applied the adaptive sampling method to develop efﬁcient ensemble learning method by boosting  Experimental results conﬁrm that our proposed adaptive boosting method is much more efﬁcient while maintaining competitive prediction accuracy in comparison with 16

IV A S CALABLE B OOSTING L EARNER BY A DAPTIVE S AMPLING In this section we brieﬂy outline how to use the new sampling method in 4 t o c ons t r uct a n e f  ci ent boos t i n g learning algorithm Boosting is an ensemble learning method that proceeds by constructing a sequence of hypotheses classiﬁers      in an iterative manner such that the weighted combination of the hypotheses in the ensemble produces a strong classiﬁer with high classiﬁcation accuracy Boosting could be done using the dataset or it could be done via sampling as the Madaboost method in 7 s e e b el o w  The well-known Adaboost method 9 whi c h i s b as ed on the entire dataset proceeds a s follows The algorithm is given a data set  and a probability distribution over the data set  which is typically assumed to be uniform Then at each boosting round  Adaboost will generate a hypothesis which has minimal classiﬁcation error over according to the probability distribution  Namely is the hypothesis minimizing the measure where denotes the correct classiﬁcation of instance  A positive weight is assigned to which is proportional to its weighted w.r.t  classiﬁcation accuracy on  Moreover the distribution is updated to generate such that the data points misclassiﬁed by would have their weights probabilities increased while the weights on o ther data points decreased Watanabe 7 8  p ropos ed t h e Madaboos t a pproach for learning by boosting based on the idea of adaptive sampling The Madaboost method avoids using all data points in and handling the distributions explicitly in selecting  Theideaistousesamplingon according to d istribution  to construct from a subset of training data from  A stopping condition that ada ptively determines the sample size for was proposed and theoretical analysis and experimental results were presented in 7 s h o w ing that Madaboost can generate classiﬁers with comparable accuracies and better efﬁciency We show that our adaptive sampling method in c o u ld be readily applied to construct a new boosting algorithm Moreover we present empirical study results next section indicating that our adaptive boosting learner uses much smaller sample size compared with Madaboost while maintaining competitive prediction accuracy The new boosting algorithm is constructed by adapting the criterion function Equation 1 for estimating the mean of a Bernoulli variable for the task of estimating the prediction accuracy of a hypothesis in each boosting round For simplicity of the discussion let us consider a xed value for the boosting round and thus x the distribution  For this distribution  each hypothesis deﬁnes a Bernoulli random variable such that if and otherwise where each object is drawn from according to the distribution and is the classiﬁcation of by the hypothesis  is the true classiﬁcation Namely Put  So is the prediction accuracy of according to d istribution  The of w.r.t distribution  denoted by  is deﬁned as  Here we try to estimate from a sample of all training data via adaptive sampling When sampling is used to estimate the accuracy   of each hypothesis  we will draw random samples from and thus observe values for the random variable as  The estimated value of after seeing a set of samples is  How do we determine a reasonable sample size S sufﬁcient to guarantee with high conﬁdence that the estimated accuracy based on sample is close enough to  for each hypothesis Oncethatis decided we can choose the hypothesis with the highest as a result for a boosting round because should be close to the actual best hypothesis with high probability There are various ways to deﬁne closeness between two hypotheses The most important requirement for boosting to work is that at least the weak hypothesis selected at each round should have accuracy above  So one very modest requirement of clos eness between the selected hypothesis and the best one is that if  then  So we want our estimated probability and the true to fall on the same side of  Focusing on each individual hypothesis  this requirement could be formulated as follows per W e i n t roduce the utility function for each hypothesis and deﬁne  Here the utility function could take negative value in case Wewanttouse as an estimate for the utility function value such that and are close i.e with the  with high conﬁdence The sampling problem is then boiled down to the problem Problem 3 We want to design an adaptive sampling scheme such that when sampling is stopped with  3 Note that for the boosting problem so boosting by sampling could be formulated as the problem to select a stopping rule on sample size such that The following Fig 1 illustrates the rationale for this formulation The stopping criterion Equation 1 absolute error can be adapted for the above problem We will replace the 003 p n in Eq 1 and the in Eq 1 by   Namely we want to test the condition

01/21 4 The justiﬁcation for testing this condition is seen from the following proposition Proposition 1 Let be a set of random samples drawn from the data set and be a hypothesis classiﬁer Let 0 be the accuracy level parameter If and satisﬁes 5 then we will also have 6 Proof First we note that when EQ 5 holds and are on the same side of 1  Consider the two possibilities If  then from we get If then by EQ 5 This shows that 1 and so EQ 6 follows This argument also shows th at if a sampling scheme can assure that the probability of EQ 5 being true is above 1  then it would also guarantee the probability of EQ 6 being true is above 1  From this we can obtain the following Algorithm Hypothesis Selection by the Massart rule for hypothesis selection by our adaptive boosting learner Some remarks are due about the algorithm The algorithm is executed once in each boosting round We require that the number of instances drawn is at least 30 in order to avoid terminating the sampling process too early In our experiments we did not observe any early termination even without implementing thi s test condition The algorithm needs to go over all hypotheses classiﬁers for each instance drawn to update the estimation of for every in the hypothesis space So the algorithm’s running time is proportional to the size of the hypothesis space and the number of samples used V E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS We have conducted some preliminary empirical studies on the above Algorithm and the results are encouraging For the sake of comparison we also implemented the Madaboost algorithm The termination criterion in 7 8 Algorithm    While Draw a random training example according to d istribution D    Compute and for each If and satisﬁes EQ 4 and the classiﬁer with maximal has Done Output  and  Figure 2 Algorithm for Hypothesis Selection using the Massart Inequality 16 all t es t i f being true or not on seeing n samples In the earlier formulation in 8  was deﬁned by where and is the size of the decision stump hypothesis space The more efﬁcient version of the termination condition   1 6  w as g i ven b y 7 We used the above more efﬁcient criterion function Eq 7 for Madaboost in our comparative study Our sampling scheme achieves competitive classiﬁcation accuracies while often using much smaller sample size e.g less than 20 percent of the samples used by 7 Table I shows a summary description of the two data sets from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Data Repository that were used in our experiments Here is the set of all decision-stump hypotheses that were searched by the boosting algorithm For numerical valued attributes a discretization is performed that constructs 6 equal-sized intervals Here the data set KR-KP refers to the chess end game King-Rook vs King-Pawn data set To test the scalability of our algorithm on large data sets the the King-Rook vs King-Pawn data set is duplicated by a factor of 100 Similar approach was also taken by some of the previous researchers in particular the authors of Madaboost also expanded their data sets in their experiments 7 T a ble I I s ho ws the p rediction accurac y comparis on between the Madaboost the method in 3 denot ed as

the port group are indicated by  The last row of the matrix represents the aggregate trafìc Agg on the member ports from port counters The row indicating background trafìc BG is added for clarity and is not directly measured by Dahu switch generates a port group trafìc matrix where the rows represent port groups and columns represent egress ports in the switch see Figure 5 The elements in a row represent egress ports and the amount of trafìc bandwidth that the port group is currently forwarding to those egress ports If an egress port is not a member of the port group corresponding to the matrix row then the respective matrix element is zeroed Additionally the Aggregate utilization row of elements stores the total bandwidth utilization on each egress port This is the bandwidth based on the egress port counter and accounts for trafìc forwarded by any of the port groups as well as background trafìc on the port that is not re-routable using port groups such as elephant ows pinned to the path by Hedera We rst pick a port group in the matrix and try to balance the aggregate trafìc for each of the member ports by moving trafìc from this port group to different member ports where possible To do this Dahu computes the average aggregate utilization of all member ports of the port group Then it reassigns the trafìc for that port group to equalize the aggregate trafìc for the member ports to the extent possible If a member portês aggregate trafìc exceeds the average across all members and the member port receives some trafìc from this port group then we reassign the trafìc to other member ports as appropriate Dahu performs this operation for all port groups and repeats until convergence To ensure convergence we terminate the algorithm when subsequent iterations ofîoad less than a small constant threshold   Figure 5 shows the steps in the algorithm Host facing ports in the switch can be ignored when executing this algorithm 4.5 Load Balancing Heuristic The load balancing algorithm considers all physical ports and port groups in the switch and aims to balance the aggregate load on all of them to the extent possible However the algorithm may take many steps to converge for a large switch with many ports and port groups We now describe a quick and practical heuristic to compute the balanced trafìc allocation The key idea behind the heuristic is to ofîoad trafìc from the highest loaded port to the least loaded port with which it shares membership in any of the port group instead of trying to balance the aggregate load on all ports By running the heuristic quickly the switch can balance the port groups at time scales on the order of a few milliseconds The heuristic as described in Figure 6 is repeated for some xed number R say 16 of highest loaded switch ports and has a low runtime of around 1ms The runtime depends on the number of physical ports and port groups in the switch and is independent of the number of ows in the system Our research grade implementation of the heuristic for our simulator running on a general purpose x86 CPU showed average runtimes of few 10ês of microsec1  Sort the physical ports by their aggregate utilization 2  Offload traffic from the highest loaded port H1 to the least loaded port with which it shares membership in any port group 3  Continue offloading traffic from H1 to the least loaded ports in order until they are completely balanced or H1 runs out of lesser loaded ports to offload to Figure 6 Load Balancing Heuristic onds to 0.5 milliseconds even for large networks with over 130,000 servers We believe an optimized version targeted at a switch ARM or PPC processor can run within 1ms with a small DRAM requirement of under 10 MB In the rest of this paper we employ this heuristic for load balancing 4.6 Fault Tolerance Dahu relies on link-level techniques for fault detection and uses existing protocols to propagate fault updates through the network If a particular egress link or physical port P f on the switch is down the virtual ports in each port group which map to P f are remapped to other member ports of the respective port groups The remapping is performed by switch software and the actual policy could be as simple as redistributing the virtual ports uniformly to other egress ports or something more complicated On the other hand when the switch receives fault notiìcations from the rest of the network a speciìc egress port P f may have to be disabled for only some destination preìxes because of downstream faults We use the allowed port bitmaps technique described in Section 3.2 to just disable P f for speciìc preìxes The virtual port to physical port mappings in the port groups are left unchanged In both scenarios the only ows migrated to other egress ports are ones that were earlier mapped to the failed egress port P f  When a physical port comes up some virtual ports automatically get mapped to it the next time port groups are balanced 5 DEPLOYABILITY Deployability has been an important goal during the design of Dahu In this section we look at two primary requirements for 65 


adding Dahu support to switches the logic to implement the functionality and the memory requirements of the data structures To our knowledge existing switch chips do not provide Dahulike explicit hardware support for non-minimal routing in conjunction with dynamic trafìc engineering However there are some similar efforts including Broadcomês resilient hashing feature in their modern switch chips which is targeted at handling link failure and live topology updates and the Group Table feature in the recent OpenFlow 1.1 Speciìcation which uses a layer of indirection in the switch datapath for multipath support The increasing popularity of OpenFlow software deìned networks and custom computing in the control plane via embedded ARM style processors in modern switch silicon indicates a new trend that we can leverage where large data centers operators are adopting the idea of a programmable control plane for the switches The need for switch hardware modiìcation to support customizable control plane for switches is no longer a barrier to innovation as indicated by the deployment of switches with custom hardware by companies like Google To implement the hardware logic we also need sufìcient memory in the chip to support the state requirements for Dahu functionality We now brieîy estimate this overhead Consider a large Dahu switch with 128 physical ports 64 port groups with 1,024 virtual ports each 16,384 preìxes in the routing table and support for up to two different allowed port bitmaps for each preìx The extra state required for all of Dahuês features is a modest 640 KB Of this 64 KB each are required for storing the virtual to physical port mappings for all the port groups and the port group counters per egress port 512 KB is required for storing two bitmaps for each destination preìx A smaller 64 port switch would only need a total of 352 KB for a similar number of port groups and virtual ports This memory may come at the expense of additional packet buffers typically around 10 MB however recent trends in data center congestion management 4 indicate that trading a small amount of buffer memory for more adaptive routing may be worthwhile 6 EVALUATION We evaluated Dahu through ow-level simulations on both HyperX and Fat-tree topologies Overall our results show 1 10-50 throughput improvement in Fat-tree networks and 250-500 improvement in HyperX networks compared to ECMP 2 With an increase of only a single network hop Dahu achieves signiìcant improvements in throughput 3 Dahu scales to large networks of over 130,000 nodes 4 Dahu enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve higher throughput with fewer subîows The evaluation seeks to provide an understanding of Dahuês effect on throughput and hop count in different network topologies HyperX and Fat-tree under different trafìc patterns We rst present a description of the simulator that we used for our experiments and the methodology for validating its accuracy We simulate HyperX networks large and small and measure throughput as well as expected hop count for different workloads We then move on to evaluate Dahu on an 8,192 host Fat-tree network using two communication patterns We conclude this section by evaluating how MPTCP beneìts from Dahu through the use of non-shortest paths 6.1 Simulator We evaluated Dahu using a ow level network simulator that models the performance of TCP ows We used the ow level simulator from Hedera and added support for decentralized routing in each switch port groups allowed port bitmaps and the load balancing heuristic The Dahu-augmented Hedera simulator evaluates the AIMD behavior of TCP ow bandwidths to calculate the total throughput achieved by ows in the network We built a workload generator that generates open-loop input trafìc proìles for the simulator It creates trafìc proìles with different distributions of ow inter-arrival times and ow sizes This allows us to evaluate Dahuês performance over a wide range of trafìc patterns including those based on existing literature 6 Modeling the AIMD behavior of TCP ow bandwidth instead of per-packet behavior means that the simulator does not model TCP timeouts retransmits switch buffer occupancies and queuing delay in the network The simulator only models unidirectional TCP data ows but not the reverse ow for ACKs We believe this is justiìed since the bandwidth consumed by ACKs is quite negligible compared to data We chose to make these trade-offs in the simulator to evaluate at a large scaleÑover 130K servers which would not have been possible otherwise We simulated ve seconds of trafìc in each experiment and each switch rebalanced port groups 16 highest loaded ports and recomputed preìx bitmaps every 10ms For non-shortest path forwarding switches used 80 of available capacity along shortest paths to the destination as the threshold utilization to dynamically enable nonshortest paths These values were chosen based on empirical measurements  Figure 7 Simulator throughput vs theoretical maximum Simulator Validation To validate the throughput numbers reported by the simulator we generated a range of trafìc proìles with a large number of long-lived ows between random hosts in a L 3 S 8 T 48 HyperX network with 1Gbps links  L  S  T deìned in Section 4.1 We computed the theoretical maximum bandwidth achievable for the trafìc patterns by formulating maximum multi-commodity network ow problems and solving them using the CPLEX linear program solv er both for shortest path routing and non-minimal routing We also ran our simulator on the same trafìc proìle As shown in Figure 7 the aggregate throughput reported by the simulator was within the theoretical maximum for all the trafìc patterns that we validated In case of shortest path forwarding the theoretical and simulator numbers matched almost perfectly indicating that the ECMP implementation was valid With non-minimal forwarding the simulatorês performance is reasonably close to the theoretical limit Note that the multi-commodity ow problem simply optimizes for the total network utilization whereas the simulator and TCP in general also take fairness into account 66 


In addition we also explicitly computed the max-min fair ow bandwidths for these trafìc proìles using the water-ìlling algorithm W e compared the resulting aggre gate throughput to those reported by the simulator For all evaluated trafìc patterns the simulator throughput was within 10 of those reported by the maxmin validator This small difference is because the TCPês AIMD congestion control mechanism only yields approximate max-min fairness in ow bandwidths whereas the validator computes a perfectly max-min fair distribution 6.2 HyperX Networks We rst evaluate Dahu with HyperX networks which have many paths of differing lengths between any source and destination We simulate a  L 3 S 14 T 48 HyperX network with 1Gbps links as described in This models a lar ge data center with 131,712 servers interconnected by 2,744 switches and an oversubscription ratio of 1:8 We seek to measure how Dahuês non-minimal routing and load balancing affect performance as we vary trafìc patterns the maximum derouting threshold and non-minimal routing scheme constrained or not We run simulations with Clique and Mixed trafìc patterns described next and compare the throughput average hop count and link utilizations for Dahu and ECMP In the graphs Dahun refers to Dahu routing with at most n deroutings C-Dahun refers to the similar Constrained Dahu routing variant 6.2.1 Clique Trafìc Pattern A Clique is a subset of switches and associated hosts that communicate among themselves each host communicates with every other host in its clique over time This represents distributed jobs in a data center which are usually run on a subset of the server pool A typical job runs on a few racks of servers There could be multiple cliques or jobs running in different parts of the network We parameterize this trafìc pattern by i clique size the number of switches in the clique and ii total number of cliques in the network In this experiment we vary the total number of cliques from 64 to 768 keeping the clique size xed at 2 switches 96 servers Each source switch in a clique generates 18Gbps of trafìc with 1.5 MB average ow size  Figure 8 Throughput gain with Clique trafìc pattern Bandwidth Figure 8 shows the bandwidth gains with Dahu relative to ECMP as we vary the number of communicating cliques Dahu offers substantial gains of 400-500 over ECMP The performance gain is highest with a smaller number of cliques showing that indeed derouting and non-shortest path forwarding can effectively take advantage of excess bandwidth in HyperX networks a Average hop count         b Link utilization number of cliques  512 Figure 9 Average hop count and link utilization for Clique trafìc pattern with different routing schemes This validates a major goal of this work which is improving the statistical multiplexing of bandwidth in direct network topologies As the number of cliques increases the bandwidth slack in the network decreases and the relative beneìt of non-minimal routing comes down to around 250 Dahu and constrained Dahu have similar performance for the same derouting threshold We further nd that a large derouting threshold provides larger beneìt with less load since there are many unused links in the network As load increases links are more utilized on average bandwidth slack reduces and a derouting threshold of one starts performing better Hop count Beyond raw throughput latency in an important performance metric that is related to network hop count Figure 9a shows the average hop count for each routing scheme Dahu delivers signiìcantly higher bandwidth with a small increase in average hop count Average hop count increases with increase in derouting threshold For smaller derouting threshold the hop count is similar to that of ECMP while still achieving most of the bandwidth improvements of non-minimal routing Note that the small error bars indicate that the average hop count is similar while varying the number of cliques Link utilization Figure 9b shows the CDF of inter-switch link utilizations for ECMP and Dahu for the experiment with 512 cliques With shortest path routing 90 of the links have zero utilization whereas Dahu achieves its bandwidth gains by utilizing available capacity on additional links in the network Also we see that a single derouting can achieve most of the overall bandwidth gains while consuming bandwidth on signiìcantly fewer links in the network thereby sparing network capacity for more trafìc 67

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
