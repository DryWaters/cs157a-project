Supporting Queries and Analyses of Large-Scale Social Media Data with Customizable and Scalable Indexing Techniques over NoSQL Databases 
Abstract 
Social media data analysis demonstrates two special characteristics in Big Data processing. First, most analyses focus on data subsets related to specific social events or activities instead of the whole dataset. Second, analysis workflows consist 
of multiple stages, and algorithms applied in each stage may use different computation and communication patterns depending on processing frameworks. This paper presents our efforts in supporting the data storage and processing requirements for such characteristics. To achieve efficient queries about target data subsets, we propose a general customizable and scalable indexing framework that can be built over distributed NoSQL databases. This framework allows users to define suitable customized index structures fo r their query patterns against social media data, and supports scalable indexing of both historical and streaming data. We implement this framework on HBase, and name it IndexedHBase. Starting from IndexedHBase, we build a distributed analysis stack based on 
YARN to support analysis algorithms using different processing frameworks, such as Hadoop MapReduce, Harp, and Giraph This analysis stack is used to host the Truthy social media data observatory, and we have applied the customized index structures in supporting both query evaluation and sophisticated analysis algorith ms. Performance tests show that our solutions outperform implementations using both direct raw data scans and current indexing mechanisms in existing NoSQL databases

projects involving Big Data require efficient extraction and analysis of specific data subsets, rather than the whole dataset Social media data analysis is one such example. While social media platforms like Twitter provide vast data about peopleês social life, most research analyses focus on data subsets related to specific social events or activities: congressional electio pro t est even ts [4], et c. Co m p ared with th e sh eer size of the entire dataset at TB or PB level, the subsets are often smaller by orders of magnitude. For such scenarios efficient query mechanisms are needed for limiting analysis computation to the exact scope of the target subsets A closer observation of social media data reveals features 
including high-volume streaming data, fine-grained data records for social updates, and written-once-and-read-many type of access patterns. These features suggest distributed NoSQL databases as good options for the storage solution However, the level of indexing support varies significantly across different NoSQL databases, and their current index structures are not flexible enough to handle the queries in social media data analyses To solv e this pr oble m   we propose a general customizable indexing framework that can be built over distributed NoSQL databases. This framework allows users to define customized index structures that contain the exact necessary information about the original data so as 
to achieve efficient queries about social events. By choosing proper mappings between the abstract index structures and the storage units of the underlying NoSQL database, scalable indexing of historical and streaming data can be achieved. We implement this framework on d release i t as  an  open source project called IndexedHBase [16   Another important characteristic of social media data analysis is that the analysis workflows normally consist of multiple stages, each with a diversity of algorithms to process the target data subsets, as illustrated in Figure 1. Different algorithms may demonstrate various computation and communication patterns that are suitable for different 
processing frameworks. Therefore, to achieve efficient overall execution of the workflows, we extend IndexedHBase to build an analysis stack based on YARN [23 which is spe cia lly designed for dynamic scheduling of multiple analysis tasks using different parallel processing frameworks in a shared environment. This analysis stack is used to support the Truthy social media data observatory [17 and  we hav e d e vel ope d  multiple parallel algorithms as basic building blocks for constructing analysis workflows. Our experience shows that the customized indices are valuable for developing both efficient query evaluation strategies and various post-query analysis algorithms

II R ELATED WORK  H I L 8], an d Eagl eEy ed El epha nt [10  are systems that try to extend Hadoop [2 h in dex i n g mechanisms to facilitate MapReduce queries. However, they schedule MapReduce tasks based on data blocks or splits on HDFS, and tasks may have to scan irrelevant data during query evaluation. In contrast, our framework does indexing on the data record level, and query and analysis tasks need only access relevant data records to produce the result HBase aSta x C assand r a  5 Mo ngoD B 1 8 an d Riak [21 are exa m p les of d i st r i buted NoSQL d atabases with varied levels of indexing support. Our customizable indexing framework can be implemented on these systems to extend their existing indexing functionality with more flexibility for handling the query patterns from different applications HIndex [15 is a  proje ct t hat uses co pr o cesso r s to bui ld  secondary indices on HBase. It achieves a short latency for index updates by collocating the regions of index tables and data tables. Compared with HIndex, our framework puts an emphasis on the customizability of index structures and general applicability over most NoSQL databases III C USTOMIZABLE INDEXING FRAMEWORK  The customizable indexing framework uses the concept of and to model the input data to be indexed. A is composed of zero to multiple Each can be modeled by a JSON type of nested key-value pair list data structure uniquely identified by an field, as shown in Figure 2. These concepts can be easily mapped to the data storage units of various NoSQL databases. For example, a can be implemented as a table in HBase, a bucket in Riak, or a collection in MongoDB. Correspondingly, a can be implemented as a row in HBase, an object in Riak, or a document in MongoDB  Figure 2 Figure 3 illustrates the abstract index structure used by our framework. The overall structure is organized by a sorted list of and each can be associated with a varied number of Each contains a unique and a varied number of for embedding additional information about the indexed data are sorted by This structure is similar to the posting lists used in inverted indices  the major difference is that our framework allows users to customize what to use as  and through an index configuration file, as illustrated in Figure 4. Users can also define their own functions \(UDFs for generating and for a given data record By using proper index configurations or UDFs, it is possible to create various index structures, such as single dimensional index, multi-dimensional index, inverted index for text retrieval, or even the geospatial index described in [19    Figure 4 Figure 5 presents the major operations provided by our customizable indexing framework to client applications. The client application can use a to index or un-index a data record. The analyzes the index configuration file and generates index entries for the data record, invoking a user-defined indexer if necessary. Then the insertion or deletion of index entries is translated into data operations supported by the underlying NoSQL storage substrate for real execution. To complete a search using an index structure, the client application can invoke a provided by the framework, or a Multiple constraints can be specified as parameters to filter the index entries by their keys, entry IDs, or entry fields. Constraint types currently supported are  and   Figure 5 Regarding implementation of the customizable indexing framework, our key observation is that most existing NoSQL databases already support scalable and efficient data access through their respective data models. Therefore, by defining a proper mapping between the abstract index structures and the actual data models of the NoSQL databases, it is possible to leverage their existing data distribution and load balancing mechanisms to achieve scalable indexing for our framework Our current implementation uses HBase as the storage substrate. Specifically, we use a table to implement an index structure, a row key for an index key, a column name for an

entry ID, and a column value for all the entry fields. Since table data is stored under the hierarchical order of <row key column name, timestamp>, it is easy to support range scans over the index keys or entry IDs. Moreover, based on the region split and load balancing mechanisms provided by HBase, we are able to achieve efficient and scalable real-time indexing of streaming data. For more discussion about the cost of online index building and dynamic changes of the index structures, please ref IV C ASE STUDIES WITH T RUTHY  Truthy is a social media data observatory designed for analysis and visualization of information diffusion on Twitter It collects data through the Twitter streaming API [22  The  size of historical data in the format of .json.gz files is more than 10 terabytes. The current data rate of the dynamic stream is 45-50 million tweets per day. Tweets come in the form of structured JSON strings that contain information about users their tweets, and the çretweeté relationship among tweets Truthy uses the concept of çmemeé to represent a set of related posts corresponding to a specific discussion topic communication channel, or social event/activity. Memes can be identified through elements contained in the text of tweets These include  e.g. #euro2012 e.g. @youtube\, and Most analysis workflows start with queries about meme  Here is a list of meme identifiers such as hashtags, and is given as a pair of time points like [2012-06-08T00:00:00, 2012-0623T23:59:5 This quer y f i r st f i nd s  a ll t h e t w eets c o n t ai nin g  the given meme identifiers within the and then extracts all the user-mention edges contained in these tweets These edges as a whole construct a user-mention network for the given representing a typical pattern of information diffusion on social networks We test IndexedHBase with the Truthy queries designing a set of multi-dimensional index structures. Figure 6 illustrates one of them. This structure indexes both text and non-text data fields, but does not store any frequency or position information about the indexed terms. This is because the Truthy queries are not designed for retrieving the top-N most related documents, but for extracting information such as user-mention networks from all related social updates. To the best of our knowledge, this index structure is not currently supported by any existing NoSQL databases  Figure 6 provides efficient and scalable customized index building for both streaming and historical data. The completes queries about interesting data subsets through index operators, and dynamically invokes different parallel processing frameworks to execute analysis tasks over the query results  Figure 7 for all the queries used in Truthy, as described in   implemented with Hadoop MapReduce [2 described in  nt a g e o f t h is a l gor it h m is t h a t it  o n ly uses a small portion of the original data, and relies on the indices to complete the major part of computation. Since the size of index data is significantly smaller, this algorithm is much faster than a solution based on original data scanning  during a given time window. This is useful for many analysis purposes, such as generation of meme evolution timelines [4 an d m e m e li f e t i m e d istri buti o n   dering  t h e sch e m a o f   M e m e I nde x T able i n  Figure 6, it is obvious that this can be done solely by scanning the index without touching any original data. The algorithm is implemented as a Hadoop MapReduce program. Each mapper takes one region of the çMeme Index Tableé as input and generates the daily frequencies for each hashtag by going through the corresponding row and simply counting 11 f o r g r ap h l a yout  generation. This algorithm is useful in visualizing many graph structures, such as retweet networks and user-mention networks. We have upgraded the implementation in t h  Harp [14 t h e new YARN-c o m p a ti b le vers io n o f Twi s t er 9 In addition 2 us in g Gi r a ph  1  is un d e r d e v e lo p m e n t   V P ERFORMANCE EVALUATION  This section presents the resul ts of several important performance evaluation tests, which clearly demonstrate that our customizable index structures can greatly improve the efficiency of query evaluation and analysis tasks in Truthy All tests are done on a private eight-node cluster. The hardware configuration of each node is listed in Table I. Each node runs RHEL 6.5 and Java 1.7.0_45. For the deployment of YARN and IndexedHBase, Hadoop 2.2.0 and HBase 0.96.0 are used. For the deployment of Riak, each node runs Riak 1.2.1, using LevelDB as the storage backend Figure 8 shows the performance comparison of three query evaluation strategies for a typical query in Truthy. The strategy uses a MapReduce program to scan the

Furthermore, the difference between and gets bigger as the time window gets longer suggesting that is especially good at queries with large intermediate data and result sizes Figure 9 compares the performance of our solutions on against two implementations in completing two analysis tasks. The first task mines related hashtags for ç#p2é using data between 2012-09-24 and 201211-06. The second task generates daily meme frequencies of all hashtags for 2012-06. The implementations use MapReduce programs to scan the corresponding files and generate the results. Again, our solutions are significantly faster by factors of ten. More importantly, this comparison clearly demonstrates the value of indices in supporting analysis tasks beyond the basic queries TABLE I C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  Three major conclusions can be drawn from our experience in this project. First, to achieve the optimal query evaluation performance for different domain applications index structures should be customizable rather than static Second, indexing is valuable for not only query evaluation but also analysis and mining tasks. Lastly, an extendable analysis stack that can dynamically adopt different processing frameworks to handle different tasks is crucial for efficient execution of social media data analysis workflows. We look forward to exploring the value of customized indices to support streaming analysis algorithms in the future A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This research is in part supported by National Science Foundation CAREER Award OCI-114943 and DARPA grant W911NF-12-1-0037 R EFERENCES  1

Figure 4  Payload Allocation Figure 5  Procurement vs Hosted Payloads Hosted payloads vs 100 procurement This case study focuses on the impact of including hosted payloads as part of the system Figure 5 presents an extended representation of the tradespace where hosted payload architectures are included The 002rst immediate conclusion that can be drawn is that based on the cost model from hosted payloads offer the possibility of signi\002cant cost reductions 050between 15 and 30%\051 As a result all architectures on the Pareto front rely on hosted payload architectures On the other hand concerns about using hosted payload assets for critical applications like astronaut support have been 003agged as a major caveat In this case an optimal solution would entail using a portfolio of hosted payloads and privately owned satellites and schedule the communications through ones or the others according to operational constraints Therefore building this portfolio can be done by analyzing what communication payloads are better suited for hosted payload con\002gurations Figure 6 presents the tradespace of architectures that mix hosted payload and procured assets Results indicate that including hosted payload assets in the system does not have a major impact on its performance but requires disaggregating the monolithic satellites identi\002ed as optimal in the previous case study That being the case the next questions arise Figure 6  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets Which payload obtains better savings when being hosted How many payloads do you want to 003y in a hosted payload approach The answer for the 002rst question can be obtained by analyzing the non-dominated architectures from 002gure 6 and estimating the cost savings when hosting the different types of antennas that are considered in this analysis Results indicate that hosting an optical payload can potentially save an 28 of the cost while a low data rate antenna 050S-band\051 only obtains a 16 cost reduction 050note that these numbers are based on the system life-cycle cost and are heavily in\003uenced by the hosted payload cost model\051 Therefore it seems to be more advisable to put high data rate payloads like optical terminals in commercial satellites and retain control of S-band communications 050which in turn ensures that contingency event will be addressed by privately owned assets not constrained by the operational limitations of host platforms\051 Finally 002gure 7 presents the tradespace of hosted payload architectures color coded by the number of antennas that are being hosted By looking at the Pareto front it can be seen that almost all architectures host one single antenna as opposed to two in order to minimize the burden on the host platform This burden is also contingent on the mass and power of the hosted communication payload This is the main reason why optical terminals become so attractive for hosted payload architectures as opposed to low frequency systems that require big parabolic antennas and power ampli\002ers to close the link budgets 6 C ONCLUSION Summary This paper has presented the 002rst set of results obtained through the developed architectural tool to evaluate space communication networks It has 002rst provided a high level overview of the tool with a description of four main constitutive elements An STK model an architecture generator an architecture evaluator and a resource manager Next it has described the newly developed scheduling algorithm based on a rule-based expert system that ef\002ciently allocates the network resources to satisfy near-Earth mission communication requirements Then a discussion on the conducted validation exercise has 11 


Figure 7  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets been presented in order to gain some level of con\002dence on the results that the tool outputs This discussion has focused on the validation of the scheduling algorithm by benchmarking it with operational schedules from the TDRSS Finally this paper has presented two case studies for future implementations of the TDRSS system Based on a demand forecast for the network a 002rst case study has considered the problem of selecting the frequency band to be supported and how to allocate them into the relay satellites It has been shown that maximum performance architectures require a mix of optical and RF payloads that support high throughput communications as well as reliable low data rate communications If the traditional procurement strategy is assumed 050NASA buys and operates the relay satellites\051 then monolithic architectures are preferable unless more than two high gain antennas render the resulting satellite con\002guration too complex In turn the second case study has extended this analysis by introducing architectures with hosted payloads It has been shown that according to the current available pricing model hosted payload architectures are clearly preferable than the traditional procurement strategy with cost savings between 15 to 30 for the same level of system performance It has then been discussed the advantages of having mixed procured and hosted payload architectures as a compromise to obtain networks with reduced lifecycle costs that can still address the requirements of highly sensitive and reliable applications Results have demonstrated that high data rate payloads 050speci\002cally optical payloads\051 are the best candidates to be hosted 050with savings up to 28%\051 thanks to their reduced mass and power requirement On the other hand low data rate communication payload should be allocated in privately owned satellites as they require bigger antennas and power ampli\002ers that increase the burden on the host platform Future Work The main streams of future work are as twofold On one hand additional features should be added to the model in order to better capture the complexity of the network con\002gurations 050e.g coupling between the costs of the communication payloads depending on the level of on-orbit processing the they perform\051 Additionally the size of the tradespace is currently limited to less than two thousand architectures due to computational limitations a stringent limitation given the possible combinations from the identi\002ed architectural decisions The solution currently under development is to include a genetic algorithm that alleviates this problem by iteratively generates new populations of architectures by combining the best previously evaluated networks On the other hand the other main stream of future work is related to exercising the tool in a variety of architectural decisions and mission scenarios In the presented case studies only geosynchronous constellations were considered although the tool allows comparing them with systems that place relays in MEO and LEO orbits Additionally the tool can also provide insight in valuing inter-satellite links and how the cost of putting in orbit their extra communication payloads can be leveraged by reducing the number of operating ground stations Moreover couplings between the payload allocation and fractionation strategy should also be further explored so as to understand if monolithic architectures still become preferable if relay satellites can be decomposed in clusters of independent antennas and payloads Finally supplementary what-if analysis can be conducted based on 0501\051 the demand forecast for the 2020-2030 time frame 0502\051 granted spectrum allocations to NASA and 0503\051 technology improvements that increase the spectral ef\002ciency of the communication payloads 12
