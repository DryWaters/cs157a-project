The Mining Associations with Secrecy Konstraints \(MASK algorithm and its improved versions were proposed as data mining approaches for privacy preserving association rules 
The MASK algorithm only adopts a data perturbation strategy, which leads to a low privacy-preserving degree Moreover, it is difficult to apply the MASK algorithm into practices because of its long execution time. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on data perturbation and query restriction \(DPQR\o improve the privacy-preserving degree by multi-parameters perturbation. In order to improve the time-efficiency, the calculation to obtain an inverse matrix is simplified by dividing the matrix into blocks; meanwhile, a further optimization is provided to reduce the number of scanning database by set theory. Both theoretical analyses and experiment results prove that the 
proposed DPQR algorithm has better performance Keywords Data mining, association rules, multi-parameters perturbation, privacy preservation   I  I NTRODUCTION  The amount of data in our world has been exploding Obtaining valuable information from mass data is a precondition for decision making, which drew more attention of scholars and engineers. Data mining is a powerful data analysis tool, by which rules, patterns and knowledge from large datasets can be extracted. However, people's privacy cannot be effectively protected during the data mining process  n st a n c e t h r o ugh dat a m i ni ng t h e a s s o c i a t i o n  r u l e s 
between various diseases could be acquired from patient records \(Adult women with diabetes may have cardio-cerebrovascular diseases at the same time\ But it inevitably causes the exposure of case data, thus resulting in the leakage of patient privacy. Therefore, how to protect information privacy and security in big data analysis has become a major challenge. In order to deal with the relationship between data privacy preservation and data analysis, privacy-preserving data mining technology emerged and has made some great progress  Association rules mining has been playing an important role in the field of data mining. It was first proposed by Agrawal et al n 1993 S i nc e cor r e l at io n or re l a t e d l i n ks 
among items can be found by association rules mining, it has been widely applied in decision support by governments enterprises, and individuals [3   When it comes to the data mining algorithms  for privacy preserving association rules, the low execution efficiency is still a common problem. This paper presents a new algorithm which improves the time efficiency from two aspects and has a better degree of privacy protection This paper is organized as follows: the original MASK algorithm and its improved versions are introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, the proposed DPQR \(data perturbation and query restriction\ algorithm is presented. Theoretical analyses 
and experiment results are provided in Section 4. Conclusion and future work are given in Section 5 II  R ELATED WORK  A  Research Status As an important research branch of data mining Association rules mining has made significant progress in privacy protection area [4  M A SK \(Min in g A sso ci ati o n s w ith  Secrecy Konstraints\as first put forward by Rizvi et al. [5 in  2002. Using the methods of randomized disturbance and reconstruction of distribution, privacy-preserving data mining for association rules was achieved in MASK algorithm. But the low time-efficiency of reconstructing original support limited its practical applications. In order to improve the 
time-efficiency, EMASK \(Efficient Mask\as proposed by Agrawal et al  6 in 2004. But the EMASK did not break the exponential complexity of reconstructing original support. A new optimization called MMASK \(Modified MASK\, was given by Andruszkiewicz n  20 07, w h i c h d e c r e a s e d  t i m e  complexity than EMASK. Nevertheless, the above algorithms were only based on the data perturbation approach, which led to low privacy-preserving degree. Moreover, the time complexity still had room for improvement [8  B  The MASK Algorithm By using the randomization approach, the original data are distorted in MASK algorithm. With the help of support reconstruction method, the frequent itemsets can be acquired 
from distorted data. Suppose that database tuple is composed by 0 and 1 \(1 shows the existence of attribute, attribute is non-existent when the value is 0\, the probability that each data item kept original value is p or reversed in probability 1 p   All database tuples are distorted in the same way to form a new Proceedin g s of the 2014 IEEE 18th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Desi g n 978-1-4799-3776-9/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 265 


 database and data mining is carried out in the distorted database Data set can be seen as a Boolean matrix. The real dataset matrix is expressed as T and D is the disturbed dataset matrix by using parameter p The number of ‘1’ and ‘0 included in the th i column of T is defined as 1 T c  0 T c respectively. While 1 D c  and 0 D c  have the similar definition Following gives the distortion process 10 1 1  TT D cpc pc     01 0 1  TT D cpc pc     The following equations can be obtained  1 TD CMC    1    Where 1 1 p p M p p     1 0 D D D c C c   1 0 T T T c C c   Then formula \(1\ is used to estimate the real support of 1-itemset from distorted database As each item is disturbed in the same manner, it is easy to extend the formula to calculate the real support of n-itemset 1 TD CMC    Where 0,0 0,1 0,2 1 1 0 1,1 1 2 1 21,0 21,1 21,21 n n nn nn mm m mm m M mm m        21 1 0 n D D D D c C c c    21 1 0 n T T T T c C c c     The number of tuples in T  is expressed as T k c where T  has binary form of k  for the given itemset. For example, for a 2-itemset 1 T c means the number of ‘01 2 T c  means the number of ‘10’, and so on. In the distorted matrix D the definition of D k c is similar to T k c And  ij m in matrix M  is defined as the probability that a tuple of form T j c in T  changes to a tuple of form D i c in D In view of 2-itemset M  is fourth-order matrix 1,3 m  is the probability that the ‘11 tuple changes to a ‘01’ tuple. It is equal to 1  p p   III  T HE N EW D PQR A LGORITHM  A  Data Perturbation and Query Restriction Data perturbation and query restriction are two basic strategies in privacy-preserving data mining. With the help of data perturbation strategy, raw data are firstly perturbed by data transformation, data discretization and adding noise in data, thus sensitive information is protected; then desired models, knowledge and rules are searched out from those perturbed data [9 o t h M A SK a l gor i t hm  a nd ot her op t i m i z e d  algorithms employ only data perturbation strategy. However perturbed data are still related to raw data. Data hiding, data partitioning and data sampling are applied in query restriction strategy so as to avoid raw data from being exposed. After that desired mining results could be acquired by probability statistical method or distributed computing method Nevertheless, the deficiency is that all data provided to data miner are also original raw data. In addition, above two strategies will confront a bad situation that privacy-preserving degree becomes low if only one strategy is used [10   Consequently, this paper gives a new algorithm that integrated those two strategies to improve privacy-preserving degree Supposing there're three parameters 1 p  2 p and 3 p and 123 1 pp p  The probability that data item kept invariant is 1 p while data item reversed in probability 2 p and it comes to 0 in probability 3 p The data perturbation strategy is realized by  using parameters 1 p and 2 p   When 3 p is adopted, the data item is hidden and algorithm achieves the query restriction strategy 1  Reconstructing 1-itemset support 1 T c  0 T c  is the number of ‘1’ and ‘0’ in the th i column of T respectively. While 1 D c and 0 D c is the number of ‘1 and ‘0’ in the th i column of distorted database D  respectively. The formula to estimate 1-itemset support is defined as follows 2 TD MC C   Where 12 2 2313 pp M p ppp   1 0 T T T c C c   1 0 D D D c C c    1 T c can be obtained as follows     1210 1 12  DDD T cpcc c pp     2  2  Reconstructing n-itemset support As each item is disturbed in the same way, it is easy to extend the formula to estimate the n-itemset support.

There is no doubt that this is huge time consumption The counting overhead was reduced based on set theory in DPQR [6 t t h e s i ze o f t h e d a tab a s e f o r D bsize   The database contains two items A and B the support of the items are denoted as   I A  I B  If  I A and   I B are known then  I A and  I B can be obtained using the following formulas   I ADbsizeIA     I BDbsizeIB   In view of 2-itemset, if   I A  I B  and  I AB  are known for us, the number of the other combinations can be acquired with the same rule         IA B IB IA B IA B IA IA B I A B Dbsize I A I B I A B           I AB  is the number of ‘01  I AB  is the number of 10  I AB  is the number of ‘00  The rule can be expanded as follows Suppose that an itemset is consisted of two parts 12  m AA A  and 12  n B BB then 12 12 n 1 2 12          mmn I AA A BB B I A A A BB B    12 12 1 2 m         nn IBB B IBB B A A A     267

The only thing that should be done is to query the amount of itemset in which value of each element is 1’, while the counts of other combinations generated from an n-itemset can be calculated from the counts of above itemset and formula \(7\ This can significantly reduce the system overhead for counting all combinations generated from n-itemset in distorted database. Hence, execution time of algorithm is improved effectively. In order to provide the desired intermediate results for computing, a hash table is created to store counts of the itemsets in which value of each element is ‘1’, such as ‘111…1 D.  The Complete Algorithm Through the matrix block method, DPQR found out recursive relations between adjacent inverse matrix, thereby decreasing time complexity of calculating 1 n M    Counting overhead was reduced by set theory. DPQR only need to count the set in which value of each element is ‘1’, then store counts into a hash table. The results in the hash table were used to calculate the counts of other combinations through features of the Boolean datasets The pseudo-code of the algorithm is as follows Input: the distorted database D the parameters 1 p  2 p  and 3 p the minimum support min_ sup   Output: the frequent itemsets after reconstruction 1 __ C find candidate itemset D   1 Re   min_ sup con C  estimate the real support of the 1-itemset 11   sup min_ sup LcCc    1 2   k for k L k  012   1 _ kk C apriori gen L    generate candidate itemset Re   min_ sup k con C   reconstruct real support of the itemset   sup min_ sup if c     k cL     hashtab add c count  store the intermediate result into hash table   kk return L L     Re   min_ sup k procedure con C   1 if k    1 22 1 2 11 12 1 1  1 p p M pp pp       else  11 11 11 22 1 22 11 2 11 12 22 1  1  1 kk k kk pM pM M pM pM pp           ik f or each c C    __ transDB count Get count candidate   1 _ k CtransDB Get CtransDB candidate L    obtain the required count of each combination 21 1 2 0 sup 0     k k ir j cMjCtransDB      calculate the real support of itemset    IV  A LGORITHM P ERFORMANCE A NALYSIS  A  Time Complexity Metrics In the MASK M should be acquired firstly, then use the following formula to compute 1 M   1 1 M M M     M is adjoint matrix of M  M  is determinant of M The time complexity obtaining 1 M   is 3 2  8  kk OO  But in this paper 1 M   is calculated by the recursive relations and we only need to compute the 1 2 M  So the time complexity getting 1 M  is 2  k O   Furthermore, suppose that the number of records in the database is N In the MASK, combinations generated from n-itemset should be counted by scanning the distorted database directly. The number of all possible combinations is n 2  So the running time complexity getting D C in formula 1 2   n ON But in this paper the running time complexity is 3   n On because we only need to query the amount of itemset in which value of each element is ‘1’, other combinations can be calculated based on set theory. The time complexity of 3   n On is far less than 2   n ON when the value of N is large and 10 n  So the new algorithm demonstrates excellent time performance in the counting process when dealing with large database B  Privacy-Preserving Degree Metrics The total reconstruction probability is comput  10 1  R PaRP aRP   8  Where 22 11 1 21221 1  1  1   ps p s RP p sps p pps        268

Running time of the algorithms  In research of Rizvi et al.

Execution time in DPQR is improved significantly than MASK as shown in Fig. 1  Experimental analysis verifies that DPQR has better performances compared to MASK V  C ONCLUSION  Data privacy cannot be effectively protected in the MASK algorithm, because the algorithm only uses the data perturbation strategy. In view of this drawback, the proposed DPQR algorithm is based on data perturbation and query restriction. Both data perturbation and data hiding are achieved through multi-parameters perturbation. The original data are processed in a different way by various parameters so as to improve the privacy-preserving degree. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm reduces the time complexity getting 1 M   by the matrix block method and adjacency matrix recursive relations. Additionally, the proposed approach cuts down the number of scanning database with the application of the set theory, thus the extra counting overhead is eliminated. The experiment results show that the execution efficiency of DPQR is significantly improved over the MASK algorithm  The proposed DPQR is more suitable for Boolean data, and it cannot deal with numerical data or other types of data. This is a major limitation of the proposed approach and is also the target of our future research work   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research work presented in this paper is partially supported by the Scientific Research Projects of STCSM Grant No. 13JG0500100\, the NSFC \(Grant No. 61073090 61034004 and 61173015\, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities   REFERENCE 1  S.

Overall, the combination of both techniques seems to exhibit the best precision/recall compromise, i.e., to start with a very high precision, but then to keep it as high as association rules The complementarity of the two techniques is even more evident when looking at Figure 2, which shows, for di?erent values of top-n, the number of true impacts found by Granger causality \(and not found by association rules association rules \(and not by Granger causality found by both techniques at the same time.

Also, the study can su?er of threats to external validity, as this is only one, small preliminary study. Further, larger studies are desirable to better assess the performances and the scalability of the proposed approach 4. EMERGING RESEARCH DIRECTIONS Driven by bioinformatics, where the Granger causality test is largely used to derive causal relationships among different elements, such as genes and proteins, we have developed a novel change impact analysis method that uses the Granger causality test to learn impact relationships among software artifacts. The main idea of the method is to infer the mutual dependencies between software artifacts by measuring the statistical con?dence that the time series representing the history of changes of a software artifact can be used to predict the changes of another artifact. The problem is therefore posed as a statistical test, evaluating the quality 


of forecasting of a variable given another one In this paper the method has been compared with the application of association rules [9, 10], and the preliminary results suggest that the Granger causality test can be a viable approach to change impact analysis, as it complements existing approaches. As a matter of fact, while association rules capture co-changes, Granger causality helps learning consequent changes. While not shown in this paper for the sake of space, we have compared the results of the proposed impact analysis method against traditional methods based on static analysis, and also in this case we found that they are able to highlight complementary, yet useful, impact relationships. This opens the way towards an eclectic impact analysis approach that combines existing methods, to overcome the limitation of the individual methods, and provides software engineers with a richer set of information useful to assess the impact of a change There are several directions in which the work presented here can be expanded. Of course, a ?rst direction is the development of further empirical studies to fully understand advantages and limitation of the proposed method, to compare it with other \(traditional and to develop heuristics for improvement The application of Granger causality depends entirely on the appropriate selection of variables. In this paper we have used an impulsive \(0,1 in a snapshot. However, other variables should be explored for example the variation of some metric values. Furthermore, the method could be applied for object-oriented system, considering classes and methods instead of functions We are interested to compare the Granger causality approach against the dynamic Bayesian network inference, which is a well-known approach used to derive causal relationships. Finally, we are investigating the use of information theoretic approaches based on mutual information 5. REFERENCES 1] R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A. N. Swami.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
