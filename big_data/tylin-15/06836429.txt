refreshing the data cube in HBaseR equals to the time of writing the real-time data cube into HBase-R This time is related to the the size of the data cube and does not change as the number of updates increases We also evaluate the scalability of R-Store In this experiment the number of nodes and the data size increase with the same ratio The percentage of updates is set to 1 for different scalability settings As can be seen in Figure 6 the running time of both re-computation the brown line and incremental update blue line do not change much as the number of nodes increase which demonstrates the scalability of R-Store 1 algorithm which optimizes the real-time query using the data cube with the algorithm implemented with the operation The cluster settings are the same as those of Figure 5 except that we 223x the number of updates to 8,000 million and vary the percentage of the keys updated Figure 7\(a shows the processing time of both algorithms for a typical data cube slice query algorithm consists of two parts the black rectangle ReCompScan is the time to scan the real-time table and the yellow rectangle ReCompExe is the execution time of the MapReduce job after the scan phase In contrast the processing time of consists of three parts the red rectangle CubeScan is the time to scan the data cube the blue rectangle UpdateScan is the time to scan the performs much better than  It outperforms the approach for two reasons 1 by using adaptive incremental scan it scans fewer data in HBase-R and shuf\224es fewer data to MapReduce 2 its MapReduce job processes fewer data than that of re-computation However as the percentage of updated keys increases more data are shuf\224ed from HBaseR to MapReduce Thus both the scan time and the execution time increase In contrast for  since the always shuf\224es one version for each key to MapReduce the amount of data shuf\224ed from HBase-R is constant As a result the running time of is almost constant Due to the existence of the 223ltering condition on attribute  most tuples of the table are 223ltered and fewer data are sorted and shuf\224ed during the execution of the MapReduce job As a result the difference between the execution times is not so signi\223cant In general algorithm outperforms algorithm when the percentage of keys being updated is low In addition to the data cube slice query we also evaluate TPC-H Q1 Figure 7\(b with the same experimental settings We did not illustrate other benchmark queries as they involve multiple tables which will not be able to illustrate as clearly the effectiveness of the basic operators supported in R-Store The parameter of TPC-H Q1 is set to 215365\216 days and only about 15 of the tuples are 223ltered  table since we only build the data cube on attributes  and  the data cube is much smaller than the real-time table and the time to scan the data cube is around 20 seconds Overall Figure 7\(b demonstrates that the performance of is signi\223cantly better than that of  To select the better querying method among the two we use the cost model Section V-C to estimate the number of I/Os Figure 8 shows the running time of  and the I/Os estimated for both and algorithms The axis on the left is the processing time of the query while the axis on the right is the estimated I/Os The estimated number of I/Os for the blue line increases linearly with almost the same slope the histogram as the processing time of the query while the estimated number of I/Os for the Baseline the brown line is constant which is around 2.52 10

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

Querying    Fig 8 Accuracy of Cost Model    Fig 9 Performance vs Freshness On each HBase-R node the key/values are stored in format Though only one or two versions of the same key are returned to MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
