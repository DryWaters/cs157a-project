work but the high level of interference between interactive and batch processing workloads currently prevents this from being a practical solution in virtualized environments Further the variable nature of spare capacity may make it difìcult to meet big data application deadlines In this work we propose two schedulers one in the virtualization layer designed to minimize interference on high priority interactive services and one in the Hadoop framework that helps batch processing jobs meet their own performance deadlines Our approach uses performance models to match Hadoop tasks to the servers that will beneìt them the most and deadline-aware scheduling to effectively order incoming 
jobs The combination of these schedulers allows data center administrators to safely mix resource intensive Hadoop jobs with latency sensitive web applications and still achieve predictable performance for both We have implemented our system using Xen and Hadoop and our evaluation shows that our schedulers allow a mixed cluster to reduce web response times by more than ten fold while meeting more Hadoop deadlines and lowering total task execution times by 6.5

I I NTRODUCTION Virtualization has facilitated the growth of infrastructure cloud services by allowing a single server to be shared by 
multiple customers Dividing a server into multiple virtual machines VMs provides both a convenient management abstraction and resource boundaries between users However the performance isolation provided by virtualization software is not perfect and interference between guest VMs remains a challenge If the hypervisor does not enforce proper priorities among guests it is easy for one virtual machineês performance to suffer due to another guest Despite the danger of interference resource sharing through virtualization has been crucial for lowering the cost of cloud computing services Multiplexing servers allows for higher average utilization of each machine giving more proìt for a given level of hardware expense Yet the reality is 
that many data centers even those employing virtualization are still unable to fully utilize each server This is due in part to fears that if a data center is kept fully utilized there will be no spare capacity if workloads rise and part due to the risk of VM interference hurting performance even if servers are left underloaded In this paper we rst study the causes of interference through virtualization scheduler proìling We observe that even when set to the lowest possible priority big data VMs e.g Hadoop jobs interrupt interactive VMs e.g web servers increasing their time spent in the runnable queue which hurts response times We control and reduce VM CPU 
interference by introducing a new scheduling priority for background batch processing VMs allowing them to run only when other VMs are not actively utilizing the CPU Our changes in the VM scheduler improve the performance of interactive VMs but at the cost of unpredictable Hadoop performance To resolve this challenge we implement a second scheduler within the Hadoop framework designed for hybrid clusters of dedicated and shared VMs that only use residual resources We nd that when given the same available resources different tasks will progress at different rates motivating the need to intelligently match each Hadoop task to the appropriate dedicated or shared server Our scheduler combines performance models that 
predict task afìnity with knowledge of job deadlines to allow Hadoop to meet SLAs despite variability in the amount of available resources Together these schedulers form the Minimal Interference Maximal Productivity MIMP system which enhances both the hypervisorês scheduler and the Hadoop job scheduler to better manage their performance Our primary contributions include 
  
A study of the workloads on 192 production servers that illustrate the vast untapped potential common in todayês data centers A new priority level built into Xenês Credit Scheduler that prevents batch processing VMs from hurting inter 
active VM performance 
  
Task afìnity models that match each Hadoop task to the dedicated or shared VM that will provide it the most beneìt A deadline and progress aware Hadoop job scheduler that allocates resources to jobs in order to meet performance goals and maximize the efìciency of a hybrid cluster We have implemented the proposed schedulers by modifying the Xen hypervisor and Hadoop scheduler Our evaluation shows that MIMP can prevent nearly all interference on a web application doubling its maximum throughput and

Figure 1 Colocated Hadoop jobs signiìcantly hurt web application performance even when Xenês scheduler priority mechanisms are used providing nearly identical response times to when it is run alone For a set of batch jobs the algorithm can meet more deadlines than EDF and reduces the total execution time by over four and a half CPU hours all with minimal impact on interactive VM performance II B ACKGROUND AND M OTIVATION Figure 2 Task completion time varies by job and increases non linearly as the web service consumes a larger quantity of CPU out of 2 cores dramatically increased when run with a Pi or WordCount WC job This happens even when the Xen schedulerês parameters are tuned to give Hadoop the lowest possible weight i.e the lowest priority However the throughput of TPC-W remains similar as does the amount of CPU that it consumes Further we nd that if Hadoop is given a separate CPU from TPCW there is no interference at all This suggests that the performance interference is due to poor CPU scheduling decisions not IO interference A second major challenge when running in shared environments is that different Hadoop jobs are affected by limitations on available resources in different ways Figure 2 shows that as the amount of resources consumed by a foreground interactive VM rises the normalized task completion time relative to Hadoop running alone can increase signiìcantly for some jobs For example Pi a very CPU intensive job suffers more than Sort which is IO intensive As a result the best performance will be achieved by carefully matching a Hadoop job to the servers that will allow it to make the most efìcient progress 
Map Reduce is a popular framework for distributing data intensive computation Hadoop is an open source implementation of Map Reduce developed by Yahoo Users write a program that divides the work that must be performed into two main phases Map and Reduce The Map phase processes each piece of input data and generates some kind of intermediate value which is in turn aggregated by the Reduce phase In this paper we investigate how to run Map Reduce jobs in a hybrid cluster consisting of both dedicated and shared also known as volunteer nodes This problem was rst tackled by Clay et al who described how to pick the appropriate number of shared nodes in order to maximize performance and minimize overall energy costs Lik e their w ork we focus on scheduling and modeling the Map phase since this is generally the larger portion of the program and is less prone to performance problems due to slow nodes Our work extends their ideas both within the virtualization layer to prevent interference and at the Map Reduce job scheduling level to ensure that jobs can make the best use of a hybrid cluster and effectively meet deadlines A key issue that has not yet been fully explored is how to prevent batch processing jobs such as Map Reduce from interfering with foreground workloads Our results suggest that interference can be quite severe if the important performance metric is interactive latency as opposed to coarse grained timing measures e.g the time to compile a linux kernel As a motivating experiment we have measured the achieved throughput and response time when running the TPC-W online book store benchmark both alone and alongside a VM running Hadoop jobs Our results in Figure 1 show that the response time of the web application can be Both private and public data centers are known to have relatively low utilization rates yet servers are the largest cost in the data center so it is more ef cient to k eep them fully utilized than shut down We have studied a cluster of 55 hosts within our university and 137 hosts that run the Wikimedia Foundationês websites including wikipedia to see how much capacity is left idle We rst examine a cluster of servers used by our universityês Division of IT The cluster uses VMWareês virtualization platform to run approximately 10 virtual machines on each of the 55 hosts The VMs run a range of applications such as web servers domain controllers databases and business applications We have gathered traces of the CPU memory network and disk utilization for each host over a ve month period For each resource we report  utilization out of the total host capacity We report the percent of memory on each host that VMware considers actively used All hosts ha v e two Xen E5-2640 CPUs 12 cores total 96GB of RAM and are connected to ten gigabit ethernet

Wikipedia Application Servers 
 
Figure 3 Servers used to host VMs for our IT department illustrate that many resources are often left idle memory is the only resource with a median utilization level above 50  Figure 4 Wikipediaês application servers are moderately loaded for CPU median utilization of 38 and highly loaded for memory median utilization of 77 Figure 3 shows a CDF of the utilization of CPU Memory Network and Disk This data conìrms that CPU is lightly utilized but also shows that network and disk see relatively low loads as well In contrast memory has a higher utilization but still has only about half of the servers using 50 or more of their total RAM 
We next analyze a trace from Wikipediaês Application Servers running in its Equiad data center starting on October 8th and ending on November 3rd 2013 1 This cluster is composed of 137 servers each with either 6 or 12 processing cores and either 12 or 60GB of RAM While this cluster does not use virtualization it still gives us insight into the workload seen by a large-scale web application and illustrates the potential for better resource multiplexing if virtualized servers could be used Figure 4 shows a CDF of resource usage on these servers over the full measurement period For this data set we report only the CPU usage and memory consumption i.e the sum of active memory and cached memory as reported by the OS since disk and network capacities are unavailable Note that these servers are not virtualized so it is possible that additional memory could be reclaimed through page sharing or idle memory taxes This cluster is clearly more highly utilized than our university data center but it still shows a signiìcant amount of residual capacityÑhalf of the CPU measurements fall below 38 and half of the 12GB servers 1 We use public data from http://ganglia.wikimedia.org have at least 2.76GB of memory free The relatively low utilizations found in both these data centers is likely due in part to conservative overprovisioning and partly to meet future needs However these results suggest that there is a great deal of capacity that is being wasted in many data centers even virtualized ones III P ROBLEM AND S YSTEM O VERVIEW This section presents the formal problem MIMP targets and then gives an overview of the system The scenario where we believe MIMP will provide the most beneìt is in a hybrid cluster containing a mix of dedicated nodes virtual or physical and volunteer or shared nodes that use virtualization to run both interactive applications and Hadoop tasks We assume that the interactive applications are than the Hadoop tasks which is generally the case since users are directly impacted by slowdown of interactive services but may be willing to wait for long running batch processes While we focus on web applications the interactive applications could represent any latency-sensitive service such as a streaming video server or remote desktop application Although we treat Hadoop jobs as  we still take into account their performance by assuming they arrive with a deadline by which time they must be complete As discussed previously we focus on the Map phase of Map Reduce as this is generally more parallelizable and is less prone to straggler performance problems i.e a single slow reduce task can substantially hurt the total completion time As in we use dedicated serv ers to run both the shared Hadoop le system and all reduce tasks We assume that the interactive applications running in the high priority VMs have relatively low disk workloads meaning that sharing the IO path with Hadoop tasks does not cause a resource bottleneck While this is not true for some disk intensive applications such as databases for others it can be acceptable particularly due to the increasing use of networked storage e.g Amazonês Elastic Block Store rather than local disks Given this type of cluster a key question is how best to allocate the available capacity in order to maximize Hadoop job performance i.e minimize the number of deadline misses and the total job completion times while minimizing the interference on the interactive services i.e minimizing the change in response time compared to running the web VMs alone We have developed MIMP to tackle this pair of challenges The system is composed of two scheduling components as illustrated in Figure 5

The MI CPU Scheduler tries to prevent lower priority virtual machines from taking CPU time away from interactive VMs We do this by modifying the Xen CPU scheduler to deìne a new priority level that will always be preempted if an interactive VM becomes runnable Next we modify the Hadoop Job scheduler to be aware of how available resources affects task completion time The MP Scheduling system is composed of a training module that builds performance models a monitoring system that measures residual capacity throughout the data center and a scheduling algorithm Our MP Scheduler combines this information to decide which available resources to assign to each incoming Hadoop Job to ensure it meets its deadline while making the most productive use of all available capacity IV I NTERACTIVE VM S CHEDULING IN X EN This section rst diagnoses the performance issues of Xenês current Credit scheduler when mixing latency sensitive and computationally intensive virtual machines We then describe how we have enhanced Xenês scheduler to help minimize this interference Xenês Credit scheduler is a non-preemptive weighted fairshare scheduler As a VM runs its VCPUs are dynamically assigned one of three priorities over under or boost ordered from lowest to highest Each physical CPU has a local run queue for runnable VCPUs and VMs are selected by their priority class Every 30ms a system-wide accounting thread updates the credits for each VCPU according to its weight share and resorts the queue if needed If the credits for a VCPU are negative Xen assigns over priority to this VCPU since it has consumed more than its share If the credits are positive it is assigned under priority Every 10ms Xen updates the currently running VCPUês credits based on the VCPU running time In order to improve a virtual machineês I/O performance if a VCPU is woken up e.g because an IO request completes and it has credits left it will be given boost priority and immediately scheduled After the boosted VCPU consumes a non-negligible amount of CPU resources then Xen resets the priority to under Our goal is to run processor or data intensive virtual machines in the background without affecting the more important interactive services Therefore we have modiìed Xenês scheduler to deìne a new extra low priority class

Monitoring Cluster Resource Availability Job Progress Checking Deadlines Map Phase Completion Time 
Virtual machines of this class are always placed at the end of the Runnable queue after any higher priority VMs We also adjust the Boost priority mechanism so that background VMs can never be boosted and so that if a regular VM is woken up due to an I/O interrupt it will always be able to preempt a background VM regardless of its current priority i.e under or over This scheduling algorithm minimizes the potential CPU interference between interactive and Hadoop virtual machines but it can cause starvation for background VMs To prevent this we allow a period  and execution time  to be speciìed If over seconds the VM has not been in the Running state for milliseconds then itês priority is raised from background to over After it is scheduled for the speciìed time slice it reverts back to background mode We use this to ensure that Hadoop VMs do not become completely inaccessible via SSH and so they can continue to send heartbeat messages to the Hadoop job scheduler While this mechanism is not necessary when running interactive VMs that typically leave the CPU idle part of the time it can be important if MIMP is run either with CPU intensive foreground tasks or with a very large number of interactive VMs V P ROGRESS A WA R E D EADLINE S CHEDULING IN H ADOOP A Hadoop Job is broken down into multiple tasks which each perform processing on a small part of the total data set When run on dedicated servers the total job completion time can be reliably predicted based on the input data size and previoulsy trained models 18 The challenge in MIMP is to understand how job completion times will change when map tasks are run on servers with variable amounts of spare capacity Using this information MIMP then instructs the Hadoop Job Tracker on how to allocate slots i.e available shared or dedicated workers to each job MIMP monitors resource usage information on each node to help guide task placement and prevent overload MIMP runs a monitoring agent on each dedicated and shared node and sends periodic resource measurements to the centralized MP Job Scheduler component MIMP tracks the CPU utilization and disk read and write rates of each virtual machine on each host These resource measurements are then passed on to the modeling and task scheduling components as described in the following sections MIMP uses task completion time models to predict the of different job types on a shared node with a given level of resources As shown previously in Figure 2 each job needs its own task completion time model The model is trained by running map tasks on shared nodes with different available CPU capacities This can either be done ofîine in advance or the rst set of tasks for a new job can be distributed to different nodes for measurement and then a model can be generated and updated as tasks complete Our current implementation assumes that all jobs have been trained in advance on nodes with a range of utilization levels Once a job has been trained for one data input size it can generally be easily scaled to accurately predict other data sizes The progress model for a job of type is a function that predicts the on a shared node with residual capacity  From Figure 2 we see that this relationship is highly non-linear so we use a double exponential formula  provided by MATLABs Non-linear Least Squares functionality  1 where    and are the coefìcients of the regression model trained for each job The coefìcients and represent the rate at which exponentially grows In order to compare the progress that will be made by a job on an available slot we use the normalized TCT 2 where the denominator represents the task completion time when running on a dedicated node This allows MIMP to compare the relative speeds of different jobs The task completion time model can then be used to determine if a job will be able to meet its deadline given its current slot allocation MIMP tracks a resource vector  for each active job The entry represent the amount of resources available on worker slot that this job has been allocated for use 100 for an available dedicated slot 0 for a slot assigned to a different job or something in between for a shared slot allocated to this job If there is currently seconds until the jobês deadline then MIMP can check if it will meet its deadline using 3 If is greater than  the number of remaining tasks for the job then it is on track to meet its deadline We can also obtain a direct prediction of the map phase completion time using 4 which estimates the total map phase completion time based on the average TCT of each slot and the number of remaining tasks

Hybrid clusters like the ones considered in MIMP are particularly prone to disk I/O bottlenecks since there may be a relatively small number of dedicated nodes acting as the data store If too many I/O intensive tasks are run simultaneously task completion times may begin to rise T o pre v ent this we use a model to predict the I/O load incurred by starting a new map task During MIMPês model training phase we measure the read request rate sent to the data nodes by a dedicated worker Since I/O accesses can be erratic during map tasks we use the percentile of the measured read rates to represent the I/O required by a single worker per data node available In order to calculate the read I/O load incurred by a new task on a shared worker we use the normalized TCT from Equation 2 as a scaling factor 5 to predict its I/O requirement This can then be used to determine whether running the task will cause the data nodes to become overloaded as described in the following section We now present two standard Hadoop job schedulers and then discuss how we enhance these in MIMP so that it accounts for both deadlines and the relative beneìt of assigning a worker to each job The simplest approach to scheduling Hadoop jobs is to service them in the order they arriveÑall tasks for the rst job are run until it nishes then all tasks of the second job and so on Not surprisingly this can lead to many missed deadlines since it has no concept of more or less urgent tasks to perform Earliest Deadline First EDF is a well known scheduling algorithm that always picks the job with the earliest deadline when a worker becomes available that job will continue to utilize all workers until it nishes or a new job arrives with a smaller deadline EDF is known to be optimal in terms of preventing deadline misses as long as the system is preemptible and the cluster is not overutilized In practice Hadoop has somewhat coarse grained preemptionÑeach task runs to completion but a job can be preempted between tasks It is also difìcult to predict whether a Hadoop cluster is over-utilized since tasks do not arrive on strict schedules as is typically assumed in Real Time Operating Systems work Despite this we still expect EDF to perform well when scheduling jobs since it will organize them to ensure they will not miss deadlines Our Maximum Progress MP Scheduler uses the models described in the previous section to enhance the EDF scheduler Whenever a worker slot becomes free we determine which job to assign to it based on the following criteria First MP examines each job in the queue to determine whether it can meet its deadline using Equation 3 If one or more jobs are predicted to miss their deadline then MP allocates the slot to whichever of those jobs has the closest deadline and returns If all jobs are currently able to meet their deadlines MP considers each job in the queue and uses Equation 2 to calculate its normalized task completion time if assigned the resources of the free slot It nds the job with the smallest value since that job is best matched for the available resources Before assigning the slot MP calculates the IO cost of running the selected job using Equation 5 If starting a new task of this type will cause any of the data nodes to become overloaded then the job with the next highest is considered and so on This algorithm ensures that the selected job is either currently unable to meet its deadline or is the job that will make the most progress with the slot without causing the data nodes to become overloaded VI E VALUATION For our tests we use Xen 4.2.1 with Linux 3.7 running on a heterogenous cluster of Dell servers with Intel E5-2420 and Xeon X3450 CPUs with each having 16GB of RAM The E5-2420 has six physical cores at 1.90GHz with 64KB of L1 cache and 256KB of L2 cache per core and a shared 15MB L3 cache and X3450 has four physical cores at 2.67GHz with 128KB of L1 cache and 1MB of L2 cache per core and a shared 8MB L3 cache Our virtual cluster contains 13 physical servers with 7 servers running 4VMs per server two for webserver with 1GB of RAM and 2VCPUs each and another two for hadoop with 4GB of RAM with 2VCPUs each Four servers run 6 dedicated Hadoop VMs each with their own disk Two more servers run web clients The web server VM is pinned to shared CPU cores and Hadoop VMs are pinned to either two dedicated or shared CPU cores depending on the server it runs Xens Domain-0 which hosts drivers used by all VMs is given the servers remaining cores We use interactive workloads and batch workloads as our workloads For transactional workloads we use two applications TPC-W which models a threetier online book store and Micro Web App a PHP/MySQL application that emulates a multi-tier application and allows the user to adjust the rate and type of requests to control of CPU computation and I/O activities performed on the test system For batch workloads we choose the following Hadoop jobs estimates

To evaluate our overal system we perform a large scale experiment where we run a trace of Hadoop jobs on a shared cluster and evaluate the performance of three different job scheduling algorithms We use a total of 20 Hadoop VMs each with two cores 6 dedicated hosts 6 with a light web workload 20-35 CPU utilization 6 with a medium load 85-95 and 2 that are highly loaded 130-170 We generate these workloads based on our observations of the DIT and Wikipedia data traces although we use a higher overall utilization level than was found in those traces since this puts more stress on making intelligent scheduling decisions The web workloads are generated using httperf clients connected to our Micro Web App benchmark We generate a random Hadoop trace composed of our six representative job types Jobs of each type arrive following a Poisson distribution the mean inter-arrival period is used as the deadline for that type of job with the exception of KMeans jobs which we set to have no deadline The job trace lasts 2.5 hours and contains 174 jobs in total Table II shows the performance statistics of each job scheduler when processing this trace Unsurprisingly FIFO performs very poorly missing deadlines for 67 out of 174 jobs with an additional 17 jobs failing to complete at all The EDF scheduler performs much better but still misses two jobs with an average lateness of 6.2 seconds The total task completion time i.e the sum of all successful task execution times is 72.61 hours for EDF FIFO is slightly lower only because it has failed tasks which do not add to the total MIMP provides the best performance missing only one job deadline by 7.9 seconds Most importantly it achieves this while using 4.66 hours less total execution time than EDF This is possible because MIMP makes smarter decisions about which tasks to run on which nodes better matching them to the available resources To understand why MIMP improves performance we now examine how each scheduler assigns workers to jobs Figure 10\(b shows the number of slots assigned to each job during a 10 minute portion of the trace This shows that EDF assigns all task slots to whatever job has the earliest deadline even though some slots may be better suited for a different job type In contrast MIMP tends to run multiple jobs at the same time allocating the

Changing the data rate from 10 kbps to 10 MBps to 1 GBps resulted in a cost of $11.35 11.4 and 11.45 million respectively Since COTS products will be used to support the communication link these cost estimates imply that there will be only a 100,000 difference in deploying a radio transmitter 10 kbps\ or deploying an optical transmitter \(1 GBps\ on the 10 kg nano-satellite While previous proposals have certainly supported the availability for laser technologies 50   t h e o p tical d e m o n s tr ati o n s  t h at ar e c u r r en tl y  b ei n g  developed by DLR in Germany and the Aerospace Corporation in the US 51  clea r l y  d e m o n s tr ate  th a t t h e  cost of optical technology is more than that Similarly changing the pointing accuracy from 0.1 0.01 to 0.001 degrees resulted in the cost increasing from FY97 $ 6.45 11.33 and 22.21 million respectively The technology to support 0.1 degrees \(sun sensors\ is different from that to support 0.001 degrees star trackers However current COTS quotations \(e.g. Blue Canyon technologies XACT show that it costs 100,000 for a nanosat star tracker system Integration may cost a few additional thousands but estimating it to 18 million more sounds a bit too much  The SSCM sensitivity study above highlights the need to have cost models that are more sensitive to different technologies and their associated complexities Complexity and risk assessment has been proposed by the Aerospace Corporation in the form of their COBRA model  We used the COBRA model in our next study where the methodology and data sets are detailed in \([39   40    5 2     T h e d ata s et r elati v e to  w h ic h  co m p le x ities  ar e  calculated included 120 DoD and NASA missions from after FY89 excluded launch delays or failures and projects with heavy international cooperation. Complexity drivers include  Table 4  column 1 subsystem technical parameters e.g mass power performance technology choices\ and programmatic factors \(e.g., heritage, level of redundancy, foreign partnership  Forty such parameters are considered that are either continuous e.g mass power and represent a range of values bounded by a minimum and maximum, or discrete such as propulsion type \(none, cold gas, monopropellant bipropellant or ion engine\ that represent a finite number of choices    For our smallsat case study, the factors corresponding to spacecraft complexity as they proposed are listed in Table 4 along with the minimum and maximum value that the component takes within their data set The column  candidate nano-satellite which will be a part of a DSM  different 3D angles from the same ground spot as it formation flies in LEO 53  5 4 55    Fo r  ea ch  f ac to r   the complexity of the nanosat is calculated as a percentage of where the data point corresponding to the nanosat lies with respect to the data points for all the other space missions considered. For discrete data, the discrete rank of the data is assessed and then converted into a percentage The average complexity of the proposed nanosat is calculated to be 21.64 


 12  Table 4: Cost estimated for a spacecraft as a function of the relative complexity of its components with respect to components used in previous missions  Based Risk Assessment \(COBRA\ model. Inputs \(Data in Column 3\ are from a candidate nanosatellite mission    The map between complexity percentile and required mission cost and development time for successful missions green triangles is shown in Figure 8  using a green trend line. The missions plotted are among the 120 studied missions and equations are mentioned within the  attempted cheaper than or faster than this model predicts then there is a large probability of failure as highlighted by the red and yellow crosses on Figure 8  Using the above model the estimated cost for our candidate nanosatellite 10 kg mission is 35.824 million and the estimated development time is 35.074 months The high cost is in keeping with the intuition expressed in the data collection section that the cost of LEO small satellites are driven more by technology than mass so the utility of shrinking the satellite should be critically assessed and avoided if the mission technology is very state of art In such cases, micro satellites would win the performance to cost ratio battle    Figure 8: Predicted mission cost and development time as a function of relative mission complexity with respect to other missions evaluated by the Aerospace Corporation [39    4 0     5 2    M is s io n c o m ple x it y  is  a  function of component complexities as calculated in Table 4 The candidate mission is a LEO satellite measuring passive Earth reflectance as part of a DSM  We ran a sensitivity analysis for the COBRA model by varying the deltaV and pointing accuracy required by the candidate satellite It does a great job in predicting the increase in costs from 1 degree to 0.01 or 0.1 degree, by 


 13  estimating a $ 200-250 increase. It overshoots the COTS quotations by a slight margin but is certainly better than the SSCM estimate of  18 million more When the required delta-V is increased from none to 40 m/s to 80 m/s to 120 m/s the respective costs are estimated to be FY97 $ 35.79, 35.82, 35.85 and 35.88 million. Quotations from a 3D cold gas propulsion system printing company called AustinSat revealed that their 1U propulsion unit capable of providing 40 m/s of delta V costs 100,000 with 6DOF thrusters included and would scale almost linearly as more 1U units are added for 40 m/s of more delta-V  The COTS systems therefore cost more than what the COBRA model predicts. The model can thus be improved and made more suitable for COTS-supported small satellites if COTS data and figures were included in the data set to calculate complexity. Since we do not have the data set only the published Figure 8  we could not make the changes  Since many small satellite missions are collaborations between many organizations, the COBRA model could be improved by adding a foreign partnership complexity factor that captures the number of collaborators not just the nationality For example a recent paper 56   formulated a data supported method of capturing international cooperation related complexity using cyclometric  complexity where CGF  0.917  0.0575*CyclometricNumber and CyclometricNumber  f\(nodes, edges, outputs    Figure 9: Cost growth required to support increasing TRL for any component as published in [57    Small satellites are always pushing the boundaries of technology. It is very probable that some of its component values will fall out of range available from past missions In such a case, cost models of TRL transition such as the one shown in Figure 9  57  s h o u ld  b e in co r p o r ated  in to  the COBRA model for the relevant factors Although TRL transition correlates to the spending it does not follow traditional 80-20 rule The COBRA model also does not capture the structural complexity of a small tightly packed satellite which has been theoretically shown to drive development costs. Structural complexity can be quantified using a simple framework shown in Figure 10 35  34   an d  ca n  b e ea s il y  i n tr o d u ce d  i n  t h e COBRA model via a new factor and recalculating the data fit  Capturing the above development costs is important for small satellites whose costs are driven more by technology than by mass. Again, since we do not have the data set \(only the published Figure 8 we could not make the changes   Figure 10 Structural complexity metric introduced and validated in [35  a nd   3 4    5  C ONCLUSIONS    We identify three major problems with current cost and risk models that limit their direct application to estimating the costs of DSMs They are the absence of reliable learning curve factors small satellite 20 kg costing tools and operations costing  Existing models and methodologies that may be applicable in part to DSMs have been identified and presented using an extensive literature survey We select ed  some appropriate methods and applied them to estimate the cost of small satellites and small satellite DSMs The exercise helped us point out valuable insights and/or inconsistencies in the results with respect to the data We also suggest methods to modify the models so that they become more suitable for small satellite DSMs  As future work the operations cost model and dynamic complexity of the mission is expected to be captured by a Systems Dynamics Model Re sults from model simulations can provide insight into the effect of design and operation decisions on lifecycle cost and risk expected to improve upon the Monte Carlo results The model results can guide the trade-off of cost with performance and can help in the se lection of a final point design for any given DSM
