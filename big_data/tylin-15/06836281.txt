astrophysical sources GRS 1915+105 and the Crab Nebula Over the past year the HEROES team upgraded the existing High Energy Replicated Optics HERO balloon-borne telescope to make unique scientific measurements of the Sun and astrophysical targets during the same flight. The HEROES Project is a multi-NASA Center effort with team members at both Marshall Space Flight Center MSFC and Goddard Space Flight Center \(GSFC\ and is led by Co-PIs \(one at each Center The HEROES payload consists of the hard X-ray telescope HERO developed at MSFC combined with several new systems To allow the HEROES telescope to make observations of the Sun, a new solar aspect system was added to supplement the existing star camera for fine pointing during both the day and night. A mechanical shutter was added to the star camera to protect it during solar observations and two 
alignment monitoring systems were added for improved pointing and post-flight data reconstruction.

    2  26 arcsecond resolution in the 20-75 keV band A milliCrab is a measure of the intensity of the x-ray output from a given astrophysical source, normalized to that o f the Crab Nebula, in thousandths In 2001, HERO demonstrated the feasibility of flying highresolution x-ray optics from a balloon platform when it captured the first focused hard x-ray images from galactic sources using a prototype payload 1   Sin ce  th e n   HE R O has flown several times with an enhanced payload that included additional optics and detectors The most recent flight was in 2011 from Alice Springs Australia with the goal of observing and mapping the angular extent of astrophysical targets such as the Crab Nebula The HEROES payload is nearly identical to that of HERO with modifications to allow for solar observations during the day while maintaining astrophysical observations at night The main upgrade was replacing the off-axis HERO star camera with a Solar Aspect System SAS To protect the existing star camera during solar observations, a mechanical shutter was added Because the star camera is needed to obtain aspect solutions during astrophysical pointing the shutter must be in the open position during this time Two alignment monitoring systems were also added one to monitor the position of the star camera with respect to the xray optics for improved astrophysical pointing knowledge and a system to monitor the alignment of the x-ray optics to their respective detectors for improved post-flight data analysis The heart of the HEROES payload is an x-ray telescope that consists of 109 grazing incidence optics configured into 8 modules. Each module contains either 13 or 14 nested optics and is complimented by a matching detector located 6 m away. These position sensitive, large area detectors are Gas Scintillation Proportional Counters GSPCs designed and fabricated at MSFC and are responsive in the 20-75 keV range \(previously described in detail in [2    A  ca r b o n  f ib er  and aluminum optical bench supplies mounting points for the optics and detectors and connects to the gondola through the elevation drive An azimuth drive located at the top of the gondola structure is employed to allow for full pointing capability of the telescope. A co aligned star camera is used for fine astrophysical pointing and is attached to the elevation flange Figure 1 shows the HEROES payload hanging on the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility CSBF launch vehicle in Fort Sumner NM during compatibility testing prior to launch More detail on the HEROES payload can be found in [3,4    Figure 1  Left  HEROES payload attached to the CSBF launch vehicle during compatibility testing. \(Right Top\Image of the optics mounted on the optical bench.

    3  3  N IGHTTIME ASPECT SYSTEM  The HEROES gondola is capable of pointing the telescope in both elevation and azimuth A magnetometer backed differential GPS system is used for coarse pointing in azimuth \(to \261 30 arcminutes\and a shaft angle encoder plus inclinometer provides the coarse elevation \(to better than \261 10 arcminutes A gyroscopically-controlled inertial-mode system with a day/night star camera is used for fine aspect determination and gyro drift compensation during astrophysical observations During solar observations a NASA GSFC designed Solar Aspect System \(SAS\ is used to provide fine aspect determination rather than the day/night camera The SAS is being presented in a standalone paper at this same venue, and so will not be discussed here Star Camera Hardware  The HEROES star camera utilizes a Kodak KAF-6303E CCD attached to a Takahashi FSQ-106 f/0.5 lens with 106 mm aperture and low-pass filter with a cutoff of 600 nm This camera is housed in a cylindrical pressure chamber that is mounted to the elevation flange of the gondola \(Figure 2 A 3-m long baffle is attached to the entrance aperture of the star camera housing and is loosely coupled to the optics flange at the front of the optical bench. An actuated shutter has been mounted to the end of the baffle to protect the CCD during solar observations. The star camera maximum fieldof view is 3\272 x 2\272  Figure 2: Image of the HEROES star camera, CCD and Lens mounted onto the HEROES optical bench The camera rear outer housing has been removed to allow access to the camera for pre-flight testing Day/Night Operation  The coarse system described above is used to roughly orient the optical bench to within 1  degree of the target to be observed Once within this window the star camera starts acquiring images of the sky At the same time the inertial gyro rates are integrated over time to give a fine-guidance position that captures the fine motion of the gondola but which due to gyro drift and a lack of initial starting position must be regularly trimmed by the star camera images with a running least-squares linear fit in each axis The star camera images contain not only starlight but also CCD bias signal \(at night\ and scattered light from the sky during the day At night this background level is calculated for the entire image by determining the mean of all pixels in the image then recalculating the mean excluding any pixels greater than 5 standard deviations above the original mean During the day since the overall background is not flat across the image the background at any point is found from a running average of the previous twenty pixels excluding pixels greater than 5 standard deviations above the running average Stars are discovered in the star camera by examining each line of the image and looking for pixels that are greater than  bove the image background  value can be adjusted by the user, real-time during flight    Figure 3: \(Upper\ Example star camera nighttime image is shown Each circle in the image indicates a potential object Lower Resulting line plot for a single line indicated in red on the upper plot Within each line, and between consecutive lines, contiguous significant pixels and a small area surrounding them are collected into an object  and the total counts above background for each object   standard deviations above the image background This 


    4  variable is usually set to 20, though the software allows the user to customize these real-time during flight Objects in the 4 images are matched to objects in the target catalog by comparing the separations of the image and catalog objects and selecting the statistically most probable matches The target position of the dynamical center of the image is calculated using the plate reduction formula Offsets from the target can then be calculated to trim the integrated gyro position used to point the gondola. Custom software allows the ground station to monitor the location of the target on the sky and plots the identified catalog objects in red Figure 4 Further detail on the star camera pointing algorithm can be found in [5  th o u g h  it s h o u ld  b e n o ted  th at th e HE R O s tar  camera lens was upgraded since this reference and was upgraded again for HEROES to improve the resolution of focus adjustments Because the star camera has good sensitivity during the day-time of around a magnitude of 8, assuming at least a 30\272 elevation and 5\272 off-set from the Sun and excellent sensitivity during the night-time to fainter than 10 th magnitude pointing solutions can be obtained throughout the balloon flight  Figure 4  Example plot of target location indicated by an X at the center of the plot surrounded by identified red Star Catalog objects and unidentified green\ objects Just as important as the ability to point at a desired source are the pointing stability and pointing knowledge A stable pointing system will allow for maximum throughput of the system and fine pointing knowledge will allow for improved post stability has generally been achieved during night-time observations when more sources are available for identification The star camera is sensitive to stars fainter than 10 th  magnitude during the night and to around 8 th  magnitude during the day, assuming at least a 30 272 elevation and 5 272 off-set from the Sun. The pointing stability is defined by an angular offset between the desired pointing vector along the x-ray axis of the telescope and the calculated pointing vector as determined by the aspect solution/gyros and platform stability measured over time  4  S TAR C AMERA G ROUND A LIGNMENT   information hinges on how well the star camera is aligned to the x-ray axis \(which is defined by the alignment of the xray optics to the detectors A special fixture has been fabricated to align the star camera to the x-ray axis \(Figure 5\. This same fixture is used to align the SAS to the x-ray axis and to align the x-ray optics to the detectors The alignment fixture is placed at a distance of 100 feet from the gondola and the fixture and gondola are leveled to better than 0.1\272. Before the star camera, SAS, or optics can be aligned the fixture must first be made square to the gondola/optical bench structure. This is done by inserting a  mounting hole Figure 5 and adjusting the position of the laser on the fixture until the laser light passes through 2 corresponding holes on the optical bench The first hole is located on the front flange of the payload, which also houses the x-ray optics. The second alignment hole is located near the elevation flange approximately half-way down the ben ch     Figure 5: Image of the HEROES alignment fixture taken during an x-ray alignment of the optics to the detectors The holes labeled 1 through 8 correspond to the locations of the optics modules on the optical bench Once the gondola is aligned to the fixture, images are taken  aperture \(also shown in Figure 5\ with the star camera itself Figure 6\. The resulting FITS file is examined using SAOImage DS9 to help the user fine-tune the camera focus 6   T h e    aperture and surrounding pixels are noted This process is repeated with the fixture placed 200 feet and 300 feet from the gondola to remove any angle off-sets Once the position of the star camera relative to the fixture is known, resulting offsets from the center can be corrected for in the pointing software. This alignment process is repeated 


    5  multiple times prior to flight to make sure that all elements have not shifted during ground testing i.e day and nighttime pointing tests   To rough align the x-ray optics to the detectors a diffuse laser is mounted into one of the alignment fixture holes labeled 1-8 in Figure 5, and the laser light is directed at the corresponding module. A Tip/tilt mount, to which the optics module is attached, is adjusted until alignment is achieved The laser is then moved to another optics alignment hole and the process is repeated. The detectors are bolted in place and are not adjustable Once the optics have been roughly aligned, fine alignment of the optics to detectors is achieved by mounting an x-ray source into each hole on the alignment fixture and analyzing the resulting x-ray image in the corresponding detector This procedure results in an angle \(tip/tilt\ alignment of the optics to the detectors of ~30 arcseconds consistent with the performance of the HEROES optics. This procedure is also performed multiple times prior to flight  Figure 6: HEROES star camera image of the alignment fixture The image  rotated -34.5\272. The rotation has to do with the angle that the CCD is mounted to the optical bench  5  HEROES  F LIGHT  One of the unique features of the HEROES payload is that it is a multi-disciplinary instrument useful to both heliophysics and astrophysics   flight can last for more than 24  hours given ideal wind conditions allowing for an observation of the Sun and astrophysical targets during a single flight. These flights are usually launched from Fort Sumner NM by Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility \(CSBF\personnel The HEROES payload was shipped partially integrated from MSFC to the CSBF Fort Sumner NM site during the first week in August 2013 Integration and check-outs were carried out over the following ~5 weeks. This included key tasks such as mounting and aligning the optics and detectors the star camera the SAS and alignment monitoring systems performing ground pointing tests and testing ground support equipment The HEROES team declared the payload flight ready on September 10th. While waiting for weather conditions to be conducive for launch the team carried out secondary system checks such as refining the x-ray optics to detector alignment and rechecking the star camera and SAS alignments to the x-ray optical axis. During this time, team members also practiced their flight operations using data from previous flights to emulate in flight operations Early in the morning of September 21st, 2013, the HEROES payload rolled out onto launch pad and the balloon was inflated \(Figure 7\ by the CSBF team   Figure 7 The HEROES payload hangs from the CSBF launch vehicle just prior to launch. The flight train with parachute attached trails behind where it meets up with the balloon \(Image: E. Given MSFC HEROES successfully launched from Fort Sumner NM at 11:50:00 Universal Time \(or 5:50 AM Mountain Time\ on a 39L balloon contains 39 million cubic feet of helium Figure 8\. These balloons can easily reach altitudes above 35 km for extended periods; given the HEROES suspended weight of > 5,000 lbs, which includes payload and 1200 lbs of ballast  Figure 8: This image was taken seconds after the balloon was released \(Image: E. Given MSFC 


    6  The HEROES payload reached a float altitude of 39 km after 3 hours of ascent Figure 9 At this point the HEROES telescope commenced pointing at the Sun, relying on the SAS to provide aspect solutions for fine pointing The HEROES telescope observed an active region on the Sun for the next ~7 hours  Figure 9: Image taken with a CSBF supplied HD camera attached to the HEROES gondola while pointing at the Sun Image: R. Salter CSBF After the Sun was no longer visible by HEROES the payload switched to its nighttime pointing mode now relying on the star camera to provide fine aspect information. Before the star camera could be used, a shutter that was employed to protect the star camera CCD during the solar observations was opened Over the next 7 hours HEROES observed the x-ray binary system GRS 1915+105 followed by 1 hour of system checkouts and a 3 hour observation of the Crab nebula The HEROES flight was terminated at 14:12:00 UT on September 22nd At this point, all HEROES systems were turned off and the payload was released from the balloon The parachute properly deployed and the payload safely landed at 15:15 UT or 9:15 AM Mountain Time Figure 10 The entire flight from launch to landing, lasted for just over 27 hours  Figure 10  The HEROES payload landed safely after a 27 hour flight The payload was undamaged and returned to the CSBF Fort Sumner site \(Image: E. Given MSFC The payload landed 35 Nm from the launch site and was visible from the CSBF Fort Sumner site for the entire flight Figure 11 The payload was trucked back to the CSBF Fort Sumner site hours after landing  Figure 11 The HEROES payload was visible from Fort Sumner NM the launch site for the entire flight The flight landed 34 Nm from the launch site landing just outside of Santa Rosa, NM.

Shih GSFC  6  A STROPHYSICAL P OINTI NG  During the flight the HEROES telescope was pointed at 3 targets: an active region on the Sun, GRS 1915+105 and the Crab Nebula The solar pointing is being presented in a separate paper at this same venue and so will not be discussed here Table 1 lists the astrophysical targets their location on the celestial sphere and the duration of the observation Table 1: HEROES Astrophysical targets are listed with their Right Ascension RA and Declination Dec and the approximate dur ation of the observation in Universal Time Target  RA  Dec  O bservation  UT  h h:mm   GRS 1915+105  19h 15m 11.6s  10 0     22 57 06 14  Crab Nebula  05h 34m 31.9s  22 0     0 8  05 1 1  01   Over extended observations such as these, both the absolute pointing of the telescope and the pointing knowledge i.e how well one knows the aspect information relative to the xray telescope\ are important As an indication of the quality of the HEROES pointing system, Figure 12 displays exposure maps for the 9-arcmi n fieldof view FOV for the GRS 1915+105 and Crab Nebula astrophysical observations The color scale used 


    7  here is designed to emphasize the periods of low exposure and indicate that the pointing was excellent during the vast majority of these observations and that the target was well within the FOV for nearly the entire time  Figure 12  Shown are 1\272 x 1\272 exposure maps for the GRS 1915+105 upper and Crab Nebula lower observations, using a logarithmic intensity scale. The re d circle in the middle of each plot denotes a 2 arcminute radius region around the intended target The white regions indicate the regions with the highest exposure and black indicates the lowest exposure time indicated in seconds\. A 9 arcminute radius region of interest was used to generate the map This region of interest is representative of the full FOV of the detectors, but does not take into account vignetti ng  The X and Y axes indicate the pixel location on the star camera CCD \(each pixel is 3.4 arcseconds\. The top-axis is RA and the rightaxis is Dec Another way to measure the pointing accuracy is to divide the observation into short time intervals and compute the off-nominal pointing errors for each interval Figure 13 displays the cumulative distribution of these offsets normalized to unity for the observation of the Crab It shows that the offset was less than 20 arcseconds during at least 50 of the observation and well within the detector field of view for essentially the entire observation  Figure 13  The normalized cumulative distribution of offsets 50  percent of the offsets over the duration of the observation are within 20 arcseconds   The most probable highest frequency offsets during the Crab Nebula observation were extremely small, less than 10 arcseconds with excursions larger than 60 arcseconds occurring rarely, only about 10% of the time \(Figure 14  Figure 14 Relative frequency of 84917 measurements of the offset pointing distance relative to the desired target position during the Crab observation Measurements were taken approximately every 0.1 seconds and are based on star camera image analysis 15 seconds between frames interpolated in time using gyroscope rate data The histogram uses 1 arcsecond bins and is normalized to 100% percent 


    8  To complement HERO ES  pointing stability HERO ES  pointing knowledge is 7 arcseconds, or a couple of pixels each pixel is 3.4 arcseconds Single pixel and sub-pixel interpolation are possible depending on the number of stars in the star camera field of view. As long as the source is in the fieldof view of the telescope, the source position can be corrected for to a resolution that is limited by the optics  7  S UMMARY  The HEROES project was the ultimate flight training program coupled to an ambitious science mission In 15 months from start to finish a new team across 2 NAS A Centers came together to upgrade and fly the HEROES hard x-ray telescope. This team underwent rigorous reviews and multiple training sessions and developed in-depth Project and Engineering Management Plans and documentation Through the dedication of the team the Project came in on-schedule on on-budget The existing HERO balloon-borne payload was modified to have the capability to make new observations of the Sun in addition to its existing capability to make astrophysics observations  Additionally, two novel alignment monitoring systems were developed and many of the HERO software and hardware systems were updated. Analysis of data from the alignment monitoring systems is  still underway and results are too preliminary to present here The HEROES launch and flight were ideal for a   in that the launch had no major issues and the flight lasted for ~27 hours from launch to landing longer than average for this type of campaign  During this time, the HEROES team observed the Sun and astrophysical targets GRS 1915+105 and the Crab Nebula The astrophysical pointing performed well with better that 20 arcsecond offsets during at least 50% of the observation The solar pointing also performed well and is being presented in a sister paper at this conference. The HEROES team is continuing to analyzing the science data and additional engineering data from the flight A follow-on payload to HEROES and the focus of future work is the SuperHERO balloon-borne payload \(Figure 15 The proposed SuperHERO payload would fly from Antarctica on a Long Duration Balloon LDB flight typical flights are 2 to 4 weeks long and will take advantage of the new systems that flew on HEROES \(such as the SAS and alignment monitoring systems\. In addition  several upgrades will be made to the existing payload including: \(1\ a lighter gondola with improved pointing and pointing stability through the integration of the Wallops Arc-Second Pointer WASP system currently under development 7    2   lar g er  ef f ec ti v e ar ea  t h r o u g h  th e  addition of x-ray optics, \(3\ enhanced resolution using new alignment and mounting techniques for the optics and 4 finer spatial resolution, solid-state CdTe detectors. These are being developed at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK by P. Seller and M. Wilson [8  an d  ar e cu r r en tl y  b ei n g  adapted for balloon flight by GSFC S Christe PI\. These detectors will provide finer spatial resolution 250 265 m pitch\, oversampling the response of the HEROES optics for improved angular resolution as well as provide higher energy resolution and higher quantum efficiency over all energies Anti-coincidence shielding will added to the detectors for improved background rejection  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The authors would like to acknowledge the entire HEROES team; including supporting mentors and advisors.
