  5 Task Arrangement Most tasks could be scheduled by clarifying needs, resource requirement and acceptable time intervals. There are still task arrangements that need to be specified in detail with strict constrains to accommodate mission design. Therefore a unified task arrangement syntax is designed for either situation, using a phrase of Quasi-natural language Table 8.  Samples of Unified Task Arrangement Description Syntax Description  Signification  ZY1q PCOM35 +3:0:21 3 hours and 21 seconds after command PCOM35 sent during revolution 1 in phase ZY 2013-1-4 20:01:23 Absolute date and time TCHAR1 +3h0m21s 3 hours and 21 seconds after TCHAR1, a character  time point TOM01 -3h0m21s 3 hours and 21 seconds before orbit maneuver TOM01 ZY1q PCOM34 Exact time when PCOM34 is sent during the first revolution at phase ZY zy1q BJ tin5 Time when elevation of spacecraft achieves 5 degree when  tracked by station BJ during revolution 1 in phase ZY 24q sooner As soon as possible in revolution 24 24q BJ sooner As soon as possible when tracked by station BJ 24-28q any IS \(random Any random time when tracked by inland station during revolution 24 to 28 24-28q any IS Tin multiple Within duration from revolution 24 to 28, time when any inland station start tracking. The option multiple indicates that not only the first one match but also any match is qualified June 6-9 around 18:00 relay On each day from June 6th to 9th, at 18:00 or around, when tracked by relay satellites Descriptions for daily task scheduling are useful in space station missions Not only fuzzy arrangement needs but also strict constrains could be expressed using unified arrangement description syntax. Only one description field covers all fields in nominal schedule, which is a notable improvement. A syntax analyzer is developed to decompose natural language texts into different categories of arrangement needs, the number of which could be hundreds in the future Usually, the unified syntax is used in constrain parameters of rules as well as attribute fields to describe how to arrange actions or elements and how to adjust when possible conflict rises Rule Based Scheduling All the scheduling algorithms and basic calculation functions are provided as rules in libraries. The rules answer for not only resource dispatching, but also task arrangements. Rules are designed to accept tunable parameters to accommodate different scheduling needs Applied rules are organized in the rule stack, in which the sequence and parameters could be edited. In this way different simple rules are combined to accomplish complex scheduling logics. By executing the stack, final schedule and sequence will be generated. The rule scheduling mechanism is the most ingenious feature of the platform and worth introducing further in additional papers Intelligent Grid Operation All formalized data are collected and edited via grids, which are designed with professional components so that features such as hierarchizing, automatic filling, filtering and data validating is achievable. For different grid forms specialized functions are provided. In automation aspect intelligent grid exceeds traditional spreadsheets completely Visualized Scheduling As the most wanted feature, visualized scheduling uses Gantt charts to illustrate resource availability, resource dispatching, resource occupying, task arrangement and result events. Furthermore, the Gantt bars are available for drag, drop and move to manipulate scheduling needs and task arrangements Actually, Gantt charts need no t to be recorded or stored since they are all drawn according to internal configurations including definitions of missions, resources, arrangements and rules, as well as external input such as orbit parameters When a Gantt bars are dragged and moved, corresponding configurations are modified. The drag, drop and move operation is only an auxiliary avoiding manual timing appointment, following which a scheduling rule must be chosen and corresponding parameters must be given to specify what algorithm to use and how the action is fulfilled  Figure 4 - Visualized scheduling design interface As is in Figure 4, surrounded by and interoperating with grids, the Gantt charts become the core of visualized scheduling Easy-Scheduling Features With modern software technologies, various features could be realized, which make scheduling easier than ever  Table 9. Easy-Sch eduling Features Feature  Comment  Solution management All scheduling configurations are organized and managed using solutions like documents 


  6 Case ignorance Uppercase strings acts the same as lowercase ones which is easily achieved using string processing One-click spacecraft model family switching When current mission model family selected, the interface and corresponding data collecting forms switch to selected family Highlighting data validation When given by user wrongly, data could be highlighted Quasi-natural language descriptions In some rule parameters and attribute fields, the users are allowed to use natural language, which would be parsed, analyzed and interpreted as discussed in [1113  Stepless zooming Gantt charts The scale of Gantt charts is tunable continuously Scheduling tracing During scheduling calculation, when error or warning occurs, all information could be logged in a tracing grid, which could link to the data form where the problem lies by clicking 8  A  U SE C ASE OF S CHEDULING  Here are the basic steps a scheduling engineer may take to design the scheduling aspect of a mission Spacecraft Model Mission Family Definition The scheduling engineer chooses from several option sets to specify a mission family with a spacecraft of LEO category Corresponding rule libraries and IO file interfaces is turned on Resource Definition A new resource called Daylight Tracking is created, using conjunction of tracking stations and daylight, so that tasks relying on these two resources could be arranged  A Crew resource is defined with time duration from 9:00 to 11:00 o\222clock daily to identify the human dependent operations including in space experiments and ground support Action Design The engineer design a new action called Scientific Experiment including elements of in-orbit operation, device operating commands and ground supporting, which could be arranged and adjusted together Inputting Orbit Data As a primary design, orbit calculation is not included, so that orbit parameters, orbit maneuver strategies and corresponding station visibility forecasts are provided as external files, with which the scheduling rules could analyze and dispatching resources to tasks Dragging and Dropping According to the orbit data and the previous definition, all the useable resources including tracking stations are drawn on the Gantt chart. The engineer drag the Scientific Experiment action from action library and drop it where Daylight Tracking and Crew resource is available Applying Rules A simple constraint rule pops up, with the action parameter automatically filled with text \221Scientific Experiment\222, the constraint parameter \22124q IS sooner\222 and the resource parameter \221Daylight Tracking & Crew\222. The engineer confirmed without modifying the parameters so that a new rule is added to the stack Executing the Rule Stack By clicking a button, the stack is executed, generating the final schedule of experiment in seconds. The fulfilled experiment task is allocated with definite inland station Kashi and start timing of 2018-09-29 09:30:15. The detailed sequence is listed in grids and drawn on the Gantt chart. In the whole process the engineer is not confronted with manual analyzing and calculation at all 9  P ROJECT H ISTORY  In March 2011, the idea and possibility of a scheduling platform of next generation is proposed within BACC, but with no immediate response acquired. During Mission Shenzhou VIII in 2011, caused by severe failure in traditional manual nominal schedules, the managers of BACC come to realize that a new intelligent scheduling platform is necessary. Since similar situations happened frequently in Mission Shenzhou IX in 2012, a team is formed to answer for the new scheduling platform project During preparation for Chang\222e III, which would be launched in late 2013, similar request was raised. The project was requested to cover at least two kinds of missions, which are human spaceflight and lunar exploration, considering more spacecraft models and missions in the future. The team started discussing, research and design in August, 2012. In the next 3 to 4 years, the platform is to be developed, tested, extended and improved With promised functions realized, the platform is responsible for the missions of next decade, including the space station project of China 10  C URRENT P ROGRESS AND E FFECTS  By now, design principles are confirmed. Although more years it will take to complete, an elementary software prototype is now available, with relevant theory, algorithm technology and operational usability testified Table 10. Implemented Effects Compared with History Aspect  Current Situation Comparing with Past Situation Unified Mission Definition With current prototype, all kinds of missions are defined in unified model and platform. With different configuration, the prototype is capable for defining 2 model families, 6 spacecrafts, 4 categories of tracking stations, thousands of commands belonging to 6 spacecrafts. General parsers are developed to process various data inputs and outputs. While in the past different system and data models must be developed Rule Based Scheduling Basic rules for fundamental scheduling algorithms such as linear adjustment are implemented, which for the first time arranges space actions at feasible resources automatically, wither either earlier preferred or later preferred policy, instead of manual allocations at fixed time and resource. Various kinds of space operation regardless the details, can all be converted into standard forms to apply algorithms 


  7 Drag Drop Scheduling For now, basic drag & drop feature is implemented to adjust elements within action as well as actions on time line. Arrangement data are collected automatically from Gantt charts and corresponding rules are called. While in the past, manual analysis and calculation must be taken to specify certain arrangement, with much more time and work spent With these revolutionary features implemented, the team obtained more support from the managers. Corresponding scheduling methodology, standard and work flow that match the platform are being proposed and demonstrated in advance for the space station project 11  C ONCLUSION  Supported by advanced theories, the platform proposed shows predicable significant potentials in intelligent mission scheduling. With different scheduling functions generalized at one platform, the logic modeling methods of double abstraction prove valid. With extensions and optimizations applied frequently, all missions and spacecraft models will benefit. The cost of developing and maintaining is well saved. With the platform, scheduling is not messy anymore and the sight of scheduling crew is elevated to mission optimizing. With basic issues including logic modeling and architecture solved, the project is the most anticipated improvement in space mission control in China R EFERENCES  1  J i nj i a n g X i n g  Y a n Z ha n g J i a n Li  Y u nc he n g Fe ng  Sequential Scheduling in Space Missions, CyberC 2012 The 4th International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery October 10-12, 2012 Sanya, China 2  S i s l ey E M  C o ll in s J E  R e s o u r c e as s i g n m en t an d  scheduling system: U.S. Patent 5,943,652. 1999-8-24  Ch e n g  R  G e n  M.

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

Querying    Fig 8 Accuracy of Cost Model    Fig 9 Performance vs Freshness On each HBase-R node the key/values are stored in format Though only one or two versions of the same key are returned to MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
