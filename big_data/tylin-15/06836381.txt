de\002nes the performance of the optics It is a measure of the spread of a single point of light and computing the PSF is a method of evaluating the imaging system spatial resolution MTF is an one dimensional measure of optical performance related to the PSF as follows H 050  x 051   f h 050 x y 051 g 0502\051 M T F x 050  x 051  j H 050  x 051 j  j H 0500\051 j 0503\051 where  050  051 indicates the one-dimensional Fourier transform operation in the x-direction The MTF in the y-direction is de\002ned analogously using the Fourier Transform in the y direction Thus MTF is the normalized magnitude of the one-dimensional Fourier transform of the PSF and usually an MTF is computed from experimental images Pre-\003ight performance of the 5 color bands are discussed in the LROC instrument overview paper and an MTF v alue of 0.37 at the Nyquist frequency was experimentally obtained prior to the launch of LRO This work discusses the image signal analysis for in-orbit cross-track and down-track MTF computation for the LROC WAC using lunar limb images In section 2 a background of in-orbit sharpness measurement techniques is presented followed by a discussion on the practical challenges of in-orbit MTF measurement for the LROC WAC 050Section 3\051 The WAC optics is described next 050Section 4\051 and the method for MTF computation is explained in detail in section 5 The results of MTF computation and the inferences drawn from image analysis for the entire procedure are presented in the 002nal two sections 2 A SSESSMENT OF I N ORBIT SHARPNESS Visual assessment of images provides a qualitative understanding of image sharpness and works well for relative sharpness comparisons However for quantitative assessment,the imaging system transfer function needs to be estimated or deduced by either PSF or MTF estimation procedures Imaging sharpness for Earth observing satellites was characterized through the estimation of MTF and PSF and has led to the implementation and comparative study  6 of v arious engineering methods for in-orbit sharpness estimation Point source based methods attempt to model the point spread function 050PSF\051 of the optics and obtain the Fourier Transform 050FT\051 magnitude Computation of PSF for imaging system sharpness assessment is preferred since the entire system characteristic can be investigated using the PSF but obtaining the PSF is more challenging for in-orbit situations where suitable arti\002cial targets are usually not available However the use of spotlights for in-orbit PSF estimation was proposed  and used for Earth observ ation satellites such as SPO T 8 050SPOT 3 SPOT 5\051 Computation of MTF is a practical choice for imaging system sharpness assessment The two main methods for MTF evaluation are the edge-gradient based method and the pulse or ratio method Edge gradient based methods use natural or arti\002cial targets with sharp transition between uniform bright and dark regions The derivative of the step function is a Dirac-delta and hence the response of the optics to a step edge can be analyzed to obtain the response due to a Diracdelta i.e the optical transfer function From the previously discussed convolution operation 050Equation 1\051 if the object 050input\051 is an edge-function 050corresponds to a sharp transition from low to high signal value\051 it can be represented as  u 050 x 051  032 0 0001  x  0 1 0 024 x  1 0504\051 Using this in the convolution integral results in the edge image function or the edge spread function 050ESF\051 ESF 050 x 051  h 050 x 051 003 u 050 x 051 0505\051 where 003 is the convolution operator The derivative of ESF gives the line spread function 050LSF\051 LSF 050 x 051  d  dx ESF 050 x 051 0506\051 and the Fourier transform of the LSF gives the OTF in one dimension 050can be visualized as a cross section of the 2dimensional OTF\051 OT F 050 f 051   f LSF 050 x 051 g 0507\051 The edge-based MTF computation methods were studied as early as 1963 10 11 and no w the ISO has a standard approach for the computation of edge-gradi ent based MTF Other advantages of this method include the ease of obtaining a target 050both natural and arti\002cial\051 and robustness of measurements The edge-gradient based method was used in the MTF computation for several satellites like the IK EO-1 14 CBERS-1 15 and CBERS-2 16 BiLSAT Quickbird 18 FORMOSA T 2 19 Landsat-7  Orb vie w-3 21 the h yperspectral imaging spectrometer HYDICE and the Hyperion imaging spectrometer 23 Bridges over water bodies are preferred targets for in-obit imaging of naturally occurring edges as the precise geolocation of the bridges are known beforehand and water bodies in the background provide the necessary contrast Imaging 2 


targets can also be temporary e.g the placement of black rectangular tarp in the middle of a desert for CBERS-1 For EO-1 lunar limb observations were used for the evaluation of MTF for the Hyperion and ALI 25 imagers In the pulse based method the MTF is obtained from the ratio of the Fourier transform of the actual image 050e.g image of a natural edge target\051 and the Fourier transform of an ideal edge A slightly modi\002ed version uses a pulse which consists of two 050leading and trailing\051 edges Knowledge of the target width is assumed 050e.g width of bridges\051 for the pulse based method The pulse based method was used successfully for obtaining the MTFs for Quickbird In addition to the edge-gradient based and ratio based methods blind computation of the PSF 050attemped for CBERS-1\051 from scene images and the use of periodic targets are some of the other research directions for in-orbit MTF computation For most methods the quality of the ESF is improved by 002tting the edge pixel values to a parametric function Typical choices for such analytical functions include the Cauchy function the hyperbolic tangent function the logistic 050Fermi\051 function and their combinations 27 3 C HALLENGES OF IN ORBIT MTF ASSESMENT FOR A LUNAR ORBITER The previous discussion relates only to Earth based satellites and their in-orbit MTF computation methods A common aspect in all the methods discussed in section 2 is that all of them leverage their proximity to the Earth and well known man-made regular structures are used for edge targets In the case of a lunar orbiter like the LRO no such advantage is available Tehere is no precedence of in-orbit MTF computation by a lunar orbiter to the best of our knowledge Some qualitative effects of scattered light were however studied for the Clementine lunar mission from using the image data in bright-to-dark transition locations Ideally a point source or an illuminated rectangular slit is required for computing the point spread function 050PSF\051 or the MTF of the optics but as such ideal sources were not available bright images of the lunar limb were used instead The sharp contrast of the bright lunar limb against dark space provides a suitable target for MTF calibration An additional advantage of using a lunar limb as target for a lunar orbiter is the absence of atmosphere which degrades the image clarity for Earth based satellites While in theory PSF can be obtained by imaging stars velocity smear for a star image often hinders such an activity Star brightness can also be an issue 050too dim makes a noisy PSF and too bright saturates making an incorrect PSF\051 as can pixel centering of the star 050due to incompleteness in the star image pattern information with respect to the CCD pixels that perform a discrete sampling\051 4 WAC O PTICS The LRO-WAC consists of the optics and the associated electronics along with the controlling subsystem for image acquisition commanding and on-board processing of image data before telemetry Relevant detail of the WAC optics is described here for completeness Figure 3 shows the schematics for the WAC optics The WAC optics consists of the visible lens the UV lens the prism and Figure 3  Schematic diagram for the WAC optics Note that the prism introduces a re\003ection in the UV optical path the color 002lter array 050CFA\051 The visible lens has a 6.0 mm focal length and a focal ratio of 5.5 It has six fused silica elements and is optimized for the wavelength range from 395 nm to 690 nm It provides a 90 degree 002eld of view over the full 1008 pixel width of the detector The lens has a design MTF of greater than 60 at 56 line pairs per mm in all bands The UV lens has a 4.7 mm focal length and a focal ratio of 5.1 It has 002ve elements and is optimized for the wavelength range from 290 nm to 370 nm It provides a 60 degree 002eld of view over a 512 pixel width on the detector Because signal is low in the UV bands the UV system data is acquired by summing pixels 4x4 The optical design provides a 4 by 4-pixel ensquared energy of greater than 80 in both UV bands The physical diameter of each of these lenses is greater than the format of the CCD detector A prism is used to allow both lenses to image on the same CCD This prism provides a straight-through path from the visible lens to the detector and a periscope-type optical path for the UV lens The latter offsets the point at which the UV image is formed laterally placing it closer to the visible image 050and therefore on the photoactive area of the detector\051 Each lens and the prism are integrated and aligned into a signal assembly with the WAC detector and electronics The color 002lter assembly 050CFA\051 is a 9.5 mm by 9.3 mm by 0.6 mm fused silica substrate with seven vacuum deposited interference 002lters laid down is the geometry appropriate for push-frame imaging It is bonded to the surface of the CCD detector with optical cement The 002nal focusing of the system is done by lapping a spacer between the CCD package and the back of the prism housing The WAC lens/prism assembly was built by LightWorks Optics and the CFA was manufactured by Barr Associates of Westford MA 5 C OMPUTATION OF MTF FOR LRO-WAC The edge gradient method is used to obtain the cross-track and down-track MTFs As discussed in section 2 this MTF computation method has three steps involving the computation of the ESF LSF and MTF in that order In our analysis the computation of LSF and MTF follows the same procedure for both cross-track and down-track directions since the one dimensional ESF 050obtained from the limb image analysis\051 3 


Figure 4  WAC frames with lunar limb for cross-track and down-track MTF analysis The images on the LHS and RHS are made by stacking successive frames of the WAC from a single observation The solid white arrow indicates the direction along which the ESF is obtained for the MTF analysis The green boundaries indicate the limits 050pixel columns 300 to 400\051 between which pixels were used for MTF analysis to avoid geometrical calibration errors is direction independent and further analysis of the ESF is dependent on the ESF nature and the ESF sampling density The process of obtaining the ESF is different for cross-track and down-track directions Obtaining Initial Cross-track and Down-track ESFs Estimation of a well-resolved edge spread function 050ESF\051 is the 002rst step in the calibration process The ESF is constructed from WAC images with the lunar limb and the ESF sampling direction depends on the spacecraft 003ight and imaging plane directions Experimental LRO-WAC images used for the analysis were selected based on the requirements of 050a\051 central position of lunar limb in the sample direction 050b\051 suf\002cient signal-to-noise ratio 050c\051 angle between the lunar limb and the direction-of-\003ight and 050d\051 statistical uniformity of the observed lunar topology For cross-track MTF the lunar limb in the experimental images is aligned along the sample 050column or down-track\051 direction and so the ESF is obtained from each line 050row\051 in a single frame However prior to this procedure each frame of the image is 002rst thresholded 050Minimum error thresholding  follo wed by a Sobel edge 30 31 detector to obtain the lunar limb which is slanted in the image frame coordinates A straight line is 002t to the slanted edge to obtain the subpixel position of the edge for each row of the frame and the angle of the slanted edge The edge angle and edgeposition information is utilized for edge-projection to form a one-dimensional over-sampled ESF The reference axis for the ESF is calibrated in milliradians 050mrads\051 units by converting from a pixels to mrads using the WAC IFOV of 1.498 Figure 5  Obtaining the down-track ESF The top image shows the rotations about the 3-axis during the lunar limb imaging process The middle image shows the angular velocity variation and the bottom image shows the variation in the DN value at a 002xed pixel location over successive WAC frames mrads 050See Table 3 in the LROC instrument overview paper\051 The edge projection technique is characteristic of the ISO 12233 method for spatial frequency response measurement and was also used in the MTF measurement for OrbView3 It may be noted that the slant edge method is only utilized for obtaining the cross-track MTFs as in the images analyzed for down-track MTFs the lunar limb appears as a segment of a circle 050Figure 4\051and not a slanted edge in every frame During down-track MTF determination the lunar limb in the experimental images is aligned along the line 050row\051 direction and the ESF is obtained by tracking the same pixel position 050row column\051 across a series of successive frames and several such pixels need to be analyzed for a robust ESF estimation Images are acquired as the spacecraft nears the lunar limb and then a spacecraft rotation maneuver is done where the lunar limb either gradually enters or recedes from within the WAC 002eld-of-view 050FOV\051 It is possible that a single frame shows the lunar limb in either the 002rst or the last row thus allowing a maximum of 13 pixels for the roll-off of the limb image pixel intensity Additionally the circularity of the lunar limb allows very few pixels as candidates for such an analysis making the ESF estimation infeasible from a single frame so an alternative method is utilized The rotation of the LRO with respect to the lunar limb is determined for use in calculating the reference axis for the WAC downtrack ESF A plot of the spacecraft rotation maneuver is shown in Figure 5 For LRO the x-direction is the direction of movement and the z-direction points to the center of the Moon The pitch angle 050rotation around yaxis\051 changes linearly while the other two rotations 050roll and yaw\051 about the x and z-axis respectively do not change As a result a steady angular velocity is obtained for the y-axis rotation which used with the inter-frame delay gives the true 4 


Figure 6  The cross-track and down-track edge spread function examples obtained for the 689 nm band angular separation between pixels at the same row column position but in successive frames Several images with slightly different pitch angular rotations 050constant pitch rate\051 were used for the analysis Thus the reference axis for pixels in successive frames is obtained calibrated to milliradian units Sampling density of ESF The WAC IFOV value gives a pixel-to-pixel separation of 1.498 mrads For spatial frequency 2 pixels comprise a line or a cycle 050alternating in bright and dark\051 so 2 pixels per 2.996 mrads The Nyquist frequency is thus 0.5 cycles/pixel or 0.3338 cycles/mrad 050Since 1 pixel of the WAC is a square of 9 um side so 0.5 cycles/pixel is equivalent to 56 lp/mm\051 Initial ESF sampling density is thus 002xed by pixel separation 050in cross-track direction\051 or inter-frame time 050in down-track direction\051 The slant edge projection increases the sampling density for the cross-track ESF but this is not feasible for the down-track Further enhancement of both the cross-track and down-track ESF sampling density is obtained by aligning the lunar limb represented by the ESF by 002tting the ESF to a modi\002ed logistic 050Fermi\051 function given by ESF 050 x 051  A  K 000 A  1  e 000 050 x 000 026  s 051 0508\051 In the above form A and K are minimum and maximum values of the ESF and the limb edge postion is given by 026  Setting A  0  K  0 and centering the function at 026  0  gives ESF 0 050 x 051  1  1  e 000 050 x  s 051 0509\051 which is a compressed 050independent variable is scaled\051 version of the simple logistic function The parameter s controls the roll-off rate and hence the spatial frequency response ESFs for which the curve-\002tting procedure was unsuccessful were rejected The normalized ESF 050 ESF n 050 x 051 051 was then obtained by using the estimated values of A and K  ESF n 050 x 051  ESF 050 x 051 000 A  K 000 A 05010\051 Figure 7  The cross-track and down-track line spread function examples obtained for the 689 nm band The normalized ESFs are then aligned using the estimated 026 value to put the limb at the zero reference axis 050calibrated in milliradians\051 position and then the entire stack of ESFs from a WAC frame are binned 050such that each ESF sample-sample separation is sub-sampled by an order of 5\051 and median value of each bin is obtained to get the 002nal ESF In the case of down-track MTF images corresponding to sample spacings 050due to spacecraft rotation\051 larger than 3.3 millirads were not used A high resolution down-track and cross-track ESF is thus ensured prior to obtaining the LSF Computing the LSF To improve statistical robustness a Monte Carlo experiment was performed using the ESF candidates from multiple WAC images Equal number of ESFs were selected from each experimental image resulting in a total of 2000 ESFs randomly selected between multiple images and multiple frames The mean at each spatial position of the ESF was then computed at each iteration and this ESF was then used to obtain the LSF The Monte Carlo method helps reduce the systematic distortion 050speci\002cally to the high part of the ESF\051 contributed by a persistent lunar image feature that spans a larger number of frames in a single image Image DN levels contributed by such spatially persistent features 050same position in reference axis\051 affect the spatially computed statistic leading to the ESF Hence ESF contributions are obtained from multiple images and in equal proportions The LSF can be obtained from the 002nal ESF by computing the discrete derivative However this leads to increased levels of noise in the LSF produced and hence an adaptive noisesuppressing method is used for obtaining the LSF The local derivative of the ESF is computed by 002tting a line centered on the desired location of the ESF 050with equal number of samples in either direction\051 and obtaining its slope The number of points in the local 002t was varied adaptively so that during the procedure the LSF shape is preserved while ensuring maximum noise suppression 6 R ESULTS The intermediate results leading to the computation of MTF 050Fig 8\051 are the ESF 050Fig 6\051 and LSF 050Fig 7\051 behavior An 5

one is more secure than the other. Regardless of the size of the footprint or th e type of architecture, wellwritten and tested kernel code will provide better security. At best, it could be said that they meet different, competing objectives. Microkernel designs have minimal kernels and offer highly customizable management planes. They allow for tailored solutions and simplify the development process Monolithic architectures are preconfigured with necessary drivers and software in the trusted zone They require less domain knowledge to set up and provide fewer options for tampering This analysis will pr ove valuable to both IT professionals and softwa re engineers. Enterprise architects and information security professionals are often forced to make acquisition decisions will less than complete information. This research identified a number of factors to consider before implementing new technologies. However, the present study should not be considered comprehensive. Other design factors should be elicited in future research. This study should also be of interest to software engineers. Often security is considered late in the software development cycle. By analyzing security implications at the architectural level, this research attempts to incorporate security concerns earlier in the design process. Future studies should focus on approaches to compensating for security weaknesses in each type of architecture

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
