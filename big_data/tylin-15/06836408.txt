The power consumption of the miniaturized systems  can reach up to 10Watt or more. In this paper we present thermal vacuum test results  of an embedded system that consists of four processors encapsulated in one FPGA package The system is a proposed multi core implementation of a small satellite On Board Computer The Xilinx LX50 Virtex 5 FPG A is used in the implementation The system design is presented together with the power consumption estimates from the design tools. The test setup in the thermal vacuum chamber and the real test data obtained from the  FPGA system during the tests are demonstrated. The data from the tests helps in judging  the adequacy of using the 65nm Virtex 5 commercial grade FPGA in space applications   T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION     1  2  M ULTI CORE S YSTEM D ESIGN    2  3  T HERMAL V ACUUM T EST S ETUP AND P ROCEDURE     4  4  R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION    7  5  C ONCLUSION     8  R EFERENCES     9  B IOGRAPHY     9   1  I NTRODUCTION  Digital d esign miniaturization of the satellite subsystems is a challenging task Increasing the density of the logic cells in a programmable chip while maintaining a limited size and power consumption is an objective for satellites developers and researchers Th is objective becomes more urgent when the mission is implemented using a small satellite with already limited power, mass and size budgets The concept of satellite subsystems miniaturization can be achieved through Sys tem on Chip SoC designs 1    Today s FPGA technology provides  high volume of programmable logic cells  Multiple Systems on Chip MSoC can be implemented in a single FPGA. Embedded systems containing more than one processor core are easy to develop using available design packages from FPGA vendors  2    T h i s  m i n i a t u ri z a t i o n  o f  di gi t a l  de s i g n s  w o ul d  lead to more efficient and cost effective satellites It is interesting to have multiples of subsystems processors encapsulated in one package which serve as the satellite digital backbone Another  interesting issue is that programmable FPGAs which can be reprogrammed remotely while operating in orbit using small microcontrollers are now readily available    This gives the flexibility of changing the hardware design even after launching the satell ite The feature of remote reconfiguration gives the chance to use the satellites as platforms for testing fault tolerant designs and collecting statistics  about the efficiency of the used fault tolerance techniques  Reprogrammable FPGAs are currently bein g used in designing real space missions 4    The advantage of using reprogrammable systems in designing and miniaturizing digital satellite systems can be doubled when Commercial Off The Shelf COTS components are used. COTS provide a cost effective de sign solution that helps in reducing the mission budget As a matter of fact the advantages of using reprogrammable COTS FPGAs such as SRAM based types face a great challenge How can we  maintain the correct operation of reprogrammable COTS in the space  environment  R eprogrammable COTS are affected by  the space radiation  thermal and vacuum  effects   They are not specifically designed to operate at the levels of radiation doses found in space orbits Also they might be inadequate to be used in vacuum env ironments due to outgassing in very low pressure. Thermal effects due to the fact that heat transfers mainly by radiation, and in some designs by conduction to heat radiators adds another complexity as there is no air flow for heat transfer by convection  But does this mean that reprogrammable COTS are not really suitable to be used in space The most adequate answer for this question is it depends This is a case by case situation where some components are manufactured at high standards and with high qu ality and they prove to be able to withstand the effects of space whil e others fail to do so 6 9   D e s i gn  techniques are used to harden the designs against the space environment effects Selection of parts which has a flight heritage is also a well known technique However when it 


  2 comes to FPGAs there is not much available data about the adequacy of using commercial grade reprogrammable SRAM based FPGAs  in space applications. Some missions are currently using FPGAs but still the results are not sufficient  for all the FPGA families and vendors 10 11    As we believe  that the future of satellites development is tightly coupled to the use of FPGAs Therefore   we decided to develop our next generation On Board Computers \(OBC\at Kyushu Institute of Technology  Japan using reprogrammable SRAM based FPGAs We develop small satellites for scientific research and it is always required to keep tight budgets so we use the commercial grade of the FPGAs. In our design we use the Virtex 5 LX50 FPGA. We decided to find o ut the answers related to the adequacy of using these FPGAs in space through extensive space environment tests. The tests are conducted at the Center of Nano satellite Testing CeNT Kyutech Japan The test results are provided to the satellite development  society as guidance  when selecting FPGAs for space missions Our  OBC at Kyutech is developed using a Multi Processor System on Chip MPSoC approach  based on soft IP cores  The objective of this paper is to judge the performance of the design in the thermal vacuum environment before actual missions are planned for launching  The following sections present the  MPSoC design, the test setup and procedure and the results obtained This paper focuses only on the thermal vacuum testing The radiatio n tests evaluation takes place at the radiation test facilities of Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute and Takasaki Advanced Radiation Research Institute Radiation test results are not within the scope of this paper   2  M ULTI CORE S YSTEM D ESIGN   The OBC design consists of a multi core system which is a n  MPSoC with four processor cores The processors are soft IP cores provided by Xilinx We used the Microblaze processors through the Embedded Development Kit \(EDK design tool The target FPGA is th e Xilinx Virtex 5 LX50 FPGA which contains 7200 slices of programmable logic  3   T h e  s y s t e m  s c h e m a t i c  a s  p r o duc e d by  t h e  E D K  i s  shown in figure 1  and the system block diagram is shown in figure 2 The system contains other soft IP cores  PLB bus is used for connecting any processor to the other IP cores Input/Output is implemented using the Xilinx XGPIO IP core. 32 bits parallel inputs and 32 bits parallel outputs are available An internal block RAM  is used for storing the boot up code  the application code and data The block RAM  of each processor is 32 Kbytes The processors communicate together through the mailbox IP core Bidirectional full duplex communication is available The FIFO depth of the mailbox is 512 bytes. Each processor can communicate w ith the rest of the processors in the system Therefore we have a total of six bidirectional mailboxes among the four processor buses An internal Timer is connected to the PLB bus of each processor to provide  timing services as well as time ticks to the o perating system that would be used. UART IP core is used for reporting the processors status to the external monitoring computer Debugging is achieved by using the MDM IP core which facilities the debugging of multiple processors through multiple ports E ach processor has a watch dog timer that monitors the operation of the processor The watch dog timer generates an interrupt every 5.4 seconds to the interrupt controller  INTC IP core  attached to the interrupt pin of each processor Whenever an interrupt i s received from any processor an interrupt service routine is provoked to allow for resetting the watch dog timer The watch dog timer would send a reset signal to the reset module of the processor if the processor failed to restart the watch dog timer On e of the processors acts as the master control which is responsible for synchronizing the system operation in case one of the  slave  processors fails and was restarted An external watch dog timer is reset by the master processor every 5.4 seconds In case the external watch dog timer is not restarted  for about  15 7  seconds, it resets  the FPGA by power cycling through the external Solid State Relay \(SSR and reloading the configuration bitstream from the configuration flash  Figure 3 shows the reset signals of the external watch dog timer  when it is not restarted  The resources used by the design are shown in table 1   Fig ure    1 MPSoC schematic produced by EDK  The system occupies about 98 of the FPGA slices which is a high utilization ratio This means that the generated heat of the system is expected to show high values  Table 1 MPSoC Resources U tilization  Slice Logic Utilization  Used  Available  Utilization  Number of Slice Registers  16,362  28,800  56  Number of Slice LUTs  18,763  28,800  65  Number of Occupied Slices  7,076  7,200  98  Number of BRAM/FIFO  42  60  70  Total Memory \(KB  1,512  2,160  70

The center provides facilities for space environment testing of 50Kg satellites with sizes around 50cmx50cmx50cm It contains facilities to test satellite subsyste ms We used a small thermal vacuum chamber   shown in figure 7 during the tests to save the consumption of liquid nitrogen which was about  0.1 kg/hour The chamber outer diameter is 40cm, inner shroud diameter is 30 cm and the length is about 80 cm The pr essure during the test was 7.8x10 5  Pa  To reach this pressure we used a Turbo Molecular Pump. Liquid nitrogen was injected to maintain the shroud temperature  in the range of 170 C  to 180 C The shroud acts a Cryogenic pump due to its cold surface which helps in condensing the outgases which are vaporized from the device under test A data acquisition system running on LabVIEW was used to collect the measurements from 8 temperature s ensors thermocouples  at a rate of 20 readings per second    Figur e    7  Small thermal vacuum chamber used during the tests  Two  temperature thermocouple sensors labeled 1 and 4 were located on the FPGA top surface  One  sensor labeled 5 was located on the  edge of the board close to the mounting point This sensor is used as the control point for achieving the test temperature profile One sensor labeled 3\was located between the FPGA board and the base plate  F igures 8 9  show the sensors attachments to the FPGA top surface and its board. Fi gure 10  shows the polyimid e heater attachment to the ceiling of the structure inside which the FPGA was located  Two sensors were attached to the bottom and top surfaces of the internal shroud. Another two sensors were attached to the bottom and top surfaces of the structure inside which the board was located A polyimide heater was used to raise the system temperatu re and simulate the effect of the heat input to the system from the sun, albedo and reflection from the earth surface  The test temperature profile was achieved by heating up the system and monitoring point \(5\in figure 8 The closed loop control was imp lemented using LabVIEW. The temperature of point 5 was kept at 60 C  during the hot soaking time and at 24  C  during the cold soaking time to match with the SMC acceptance test requirements  12    The soaking time was two hours in hot temperature and two  hours in cold temperature Two test cycles were conducted The system setup schematic is shown in figure 11

The system is placed in a sandwich structure where it was surrounded by upper and lower alumin um metal sheets of A4 size The thermocouples where attached to different locations as mentioned before The data from the thermocouples was collected by LabVIEW through a Data Acquisition \(DAQ\ module. The chamber control computer maintained the shroud te mperature at around 170 C  by controlling the opening of an electric valve to supply liquid nitrogen inside the chamber The control was carried out using LabVIEW through a Digital Input/Output DIO module Also the chamber control computer controlled th e power supply to the heater in order to maintain the required target profile temperature The feedback for the shroud temperature was provided to the control computer through the sensors attached to the top and bottom of the shroud surfaces. The feedback for the target point temperature was provided through the sensor labeled 5 in figure 8 An additional heater was attached to the lower aluminum sheet as an optional heating element  Monitoring computer was collecting the data from the software running on the processor systems during the thermal vacuum test to judge their correct operation The interface between the FPGA   which is also called the Device Under Test \(DUT   and the moni toring computer was RS422  The software that was running during the tests was developed to achieve a full test cycle of all the processor systems in the MPSoC design The algorithms of the software that run on the master processor and the slave processors  is shown in figures 12 and 13 The internal watch dog timers connected to the master and slave processors kept generating an interrupt every 5.4 sec When the slave processors receive the interrupt signals through their interrupt controllers \(INTC\they i nvoke an interrupt service routine. The routine starts by sending an acknowledgement message of four characters \(ACK0\to the master processor to inform it that the slave processor is alive and to test the mailbox connection between the master and slave pr ocessors The slave processor starts an internal timer to 


  6 count the interval between the successive interrupts received from the watch dog timer The internal timer value is captured by the next new watch dog timer interrupt and the internal timer is resta rted The slave processor reports its status to the external monitoring computer together with the value of its internal timer through the UART interface. The last step is that the slave processor restarts the watch dog timer to allow for a new interrupt t o take place. If the slave processor fails to restart the watch dog timer it would be restarted by a reset signal to be sent from the watch dog timer to the reset module of the processor   Figure    12 Algorithm executed at the slave processor during thermal vacuum tests  The master processor receives interrupts from its local watch dog timer  every 5.4 sec  The master and slave processors work on a master system clock  so the interrupts timings are synchronized  The master processo r ISR starts by reading the mailboxes FIFOs to receive the ACK0 messages sent from the slave processors If no ACK0 is found from any processor then the whole system is reset and FPGA is reloaded This takes place by not resetting the external WDT whic h leads to power cycling of the system through the signal sent from the external WDT to the SSR Data is sent through UART to the monitoring computer   F igure   13 Algorithm executed at the master processor during thermal vacuum  tests   


  7 4   R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION  The power analysis of the MPSoC as generated by the XPower Analyzer tool from Xilinx is shown in figure 14 The estimation was carried out at an ambient temperature of 26 C  without air flow and no heat sink The estimated  maximum ambient temperature in atmospheric pressure was 78.8 C This is the estimated maximum temperature which might surround the FPGA during its operation and would not lead to exceeding the operating temperature limits. The commercial grade of the XCV 5LX50 has a recommended operating range of 0 to 85 C  The maximum die temperature is 125 C after that limit the FPGA would shut down automatically for protecting the die The estimated power consumption of the system is less than 1 Watt which is a good value for a design that contains 4 processor systems   Figure   14  XPower Analyzer estimation of the system power consumption  The temperature measurements of the sensors attached to the FPGA top surface, under the FPGA board and the target profile is shown in figure 15    Figure   15  Thermal vacuum test results for the XCV5LX50 MPSoC OBC  The sensors labels in figure 15 matches the positions labels in figure 8 and 9 The profile temperature indicates the temperature at the attachment point to the satellite structure which is also known as the mounting point This temp erature was controlled using a heater and a close loop control implemented in LABView The temperature of the FPGA top surface is almost identical for sensors 1 and 4 However sensor 1 showed slightly high values than sensor 4 as it located just on the cen ter of the FPGA The die is located in the center of the FPGA as well The die dimensions for the XCV5LX50 is 1.2mmx1.2mm The FPGA package is BGA of dimensions 27mm x 27mm Sensor 4 was located at the  top surface edge of the FPGA  The difference in tempe rature between sensor 1 and 4 is due to the heat propagation through the metal cap of the FPGA and the fact that sensor 1 is directly located above the die while sensor 4 is at the edge of the package The temperature under the FPGA showed lower values as it is 


  8 not touching the FPGA at all It is just located below the FPGA board in the space between the FPGA PCB and the base plate PCB The heater temperature measurement is shown in figure 16   Figure   1 6  Heater temperature during the tests  The shroud te mperature is shown in figure 17. The shroud top sensor showed slightly lower and stabilized readings than the shroud bottom sensor. Lower readings were due to the fact that the top sensor faces the entrance nozzle of the liquid nitrogen gas. The stabilizat ion in the sensor readings due to the heat dynamics as the liquid nitrogen propagates from top to bottom of the shroud and it is affected by the heat being emitted by the system and the heater   Figure   17  Shroud top and bottom surface temperatures  The supply of the liquid nitrogen was cut by the beginning of the high section of the second cycle. We cut the supply to save the liquid nitrogen as this part of the cycle is already in high temperature and liquid nitrogen would not affect the profile when we cut it. Therefore we decided to economize the consumption by cutting the liquid nitrogen at the beginning of the second cycle high section at the time marker \(28801\sec. Cutting the liquid nitrogen supply had the effect that the curves of the temperature sensors at the top and bottom of the shroud started to raise as shown in figure 17. Again this does not affect the profile as shown in figure 15. There is another advantage for cutting the liquid nitrogen supply at the last high cycle The temperature of t he shroud would start to raise and that would reduce the recovery time of the chamber as we can not open the chamber if its temperature is very low. typically we recover the pressure to the atmospheric pressure level and the temperature to 30  C  The syste m showed a robust operation and the curves obtained were clear and expressive The FPGA system worked flawlessly and all the interrupts were received adequately during the test time. A snapshot of the processors operation is shown in figure 18    Figure   18  Snapshot of the processors outputs  The design showed a robust performance and the operation of the test was maintained successfully The XCV5LX50 commercial grade withstood the thermal vacuum vibration test at the temperature profile set by the SMC standard   5   C ONCLUSION  In this paper we showed the thermal vacuum test setup procedure and results for an MPSoC OBC developed at Kyutech   The OBC was developed using the Virtex5 XCV5LX50 FPGA. The FPGA showed robust performance durin g the thermal vacuum tests. Although the FPGA was of a commercial grade it managed to operate at the  temperature profile from 24 C  to 60  C The FPGA temperature reached about 102 C This is a high temperature as the manufacturer recommends 85 C as a  maximum operating temperature. Thermal control should be used to attach the FPGA surface to a radiator such as heat sink or to maintain the temperature profile at the mounting point of the FPGA board to be lower than 60 C An  industrial grade FPGA might be another option as it has a wider operating temperature range from 45 C to 155 C The design that was tested shows the maximum utilization of the FPGA slices which gives a good indication about the maximum expected operating temperature of this class of FPGAs in the thermal vacuum environment of space We would repeat the tests to assess the durability of the system during long test cycles about 10 to 14 cycles Also we would use heat sink for thermal control of the FPGA  We recommend repeating the te sts on other FPGAs families and designs to enrich the literature with more data about the thermal perf ormance of COTS FPGAs in space

evidently clear that Big Data has come to stay. This is 
The Linear Search and Parallel Search however shows consistent result since the focus is on the entire specified data source. The false negative values are small and the true positive index is also high. An observation however is that, the false positive and false native results in the Linear Search also re-occur in the Parallel Search. This can be attributed to the fact that the Linear Search is the underlying methodology on which the Parallel Search is running In Table IV, the result from crawling some selected websites are shown. This websites are for health care providers. Using similar types of terms from the NoSQL, we perform similar searches on the Web. The accuracy index dropped because there were higher false positive and false values. This is more likely due to the fact that the web is wide with similar written terms but with different meanings. Since not all the keywords from the web are captured in the Dictionary/Thesaurus, most of the specified terms were mislabeled In Table V, we report the results from the search in the SQL database. The data here is a fraction of the NoSQL version. The results in the structured data source show very high accuracy in comparison to the rest of the data sources This is not because the proposed framework works better with structured data source but, because the data itself is very small in comparison to the rest. Further, we know where to find most of the terms we were looking for so narrowed our database choice in the case of the Pessimistic and Optimistic Search methodologies VI C ONCLUSION With the present direction of corporate transactions, it is because most traditional business transactions which use to be paper-based are all being digitized. Besides, user generated content across different spectrum of the enterprise landscape is increasing in volume at an exponential rate. While Big Data has its tremendous advantages, the fact that the data is heterogeneous \(i.e., variety\poses new challenges Previously, the data mining and knowledge discovery in database \(KDD\procedures were designed for schema-oriented databases. However, the data today is multifaceted and has no schema. Though the NoSQL databases have been proposed to accommodate the data, not many tools are available that performs data mining and analytics from such storages Our work details an Analytics-as-a Service \(AaaS\ tool that performs terms mining and analytics from multiple data sources. Currently, the following data sources are supported NoSQL \(e.g., document style storages such as CouchDB SQL, Tag/Flat file storage \(HTML, XML, RTF\, and Textual Documents \(e.g., PDF\ Furthermore, we conducted experiments using the various styles of storage such as NoSQL, Web, and SQL.
