forwarded messages to the number of messages she posts After implementing our inîuence ranking program we plan to compare our method with others in the literature This comparison will evaluate the similarity of the lists of inîuential users that are generated by these different methods We will also evaluate the ease of use and time required by each of the inîuence calculation methods KeywordsÖbig data in social media 
I I NTRODUCTION The problem of identifying inîuential individuals in society has been scientiìcally studied since the 1890ês Ho we v er  until recently theories about social inîuence have remained 
theories due to the difìculty of gathering data that could be used to validate these theories The recent development of online social networks provides a rich source of data that can be used to study social inîuence Identifying inîuential individuals is of interest to many parties especially those who wish to have their message spread widely throughout the network Political movements and marketing companies are examples of organizations who are interested in discovering inîuential individuals Online social networks are a widely used method for spreading information and news Examples of online social networks that are currently popular include Facebook and 
Twitter Facebook is an example of an undirected social network where the relationship between users must be reciprocal In contrast Twitter is a directed social network because the relationship between users need not be reciprocal A study from 2010 found that only 21.1 of relationships in Twitter were reciprocal W e use a directed social netw ork in this work and utilize messages and metadata from Twitter in order to test our methods We consider a user in a social network to be inîuential if the information she shares becomes widely disseminated throughout the network It has been noted that forwarding of 
information is a narrow deìnition of inîuence A user may forward information based on their interest in the information itself not due to the person who sent the information Additionally forwarding information may or may not indicate the presence of factors that inîuence purchasing behavior or political opinions Despite these limitations we proceed with examining the use of information passing as a measure of inîuence in social networks because that is the behavior that is easily observable in the network 
A The Twitter Social Network 
Twitter is a microblogging service where users post short messages of up to 140 characters These messages are called 
tweets The audience for a tweet is other Twitter users called followers who choose to subscribe to the tweet authorês message feed Unlike social networks such as Facebook the following relationship in Twitter need not be reciprocal Most users make their tweets public and any user may follow any other user without the consent of the followed user By following a user the follower receives the followed userês tweets Twitter users forward messages through a process called retweeting We can illustrate the retweeting process by considering two hypothetical users Alice and Bob Bob follows 
Alice and reads her tweets When Bob reads a tweet that he nds particularly interesting he may choose to retweet that tweet Now Aliceês tweet will be sent to all of Bobês followers Messages are spread through Twitter by cascades of retweets Because most users allow their tweets to be publicly broadcast Twitter is an appealing social network to use for research purposes There is a publicly available application programming interface API that we can use to write programs that gather messages and associated metadata from Twitter 
B Measures of Inîuence in Twitter 
Three ways of measuring inîuence in Twitter are indegree retweets and mentions Indegree refers to the number of 
followers the user has Retweets are the number of times a userês messages are forwarded in the network Mentions are the number of times a user is referred to in another userês tweet Indegree measures the size of the audience of a user This could also be considered a measure of a userês popularity A user with man y follo wers has the potential of a large audience for their tweets We say that this is a potential audience because the followers may or may not actually pay attention to the given userês messages

Mentions are a good measure of how connected a user is to their immediate network Often mentions are used to engage the mentioned user in a conversation Other times mentions are used when talking about the mentioned user Therefore a large number of mentions shows that a user has a high ability to engage in conversation Retweets measure how widely a userês message disseminates through the network 2 A highly retweeted message shows that the user has the ability to generate content that is valuable for other users to pass along to their followers This paper is organized as follows Section II discusses related work Our methods for calculating inîuence and collecting data are presented in Section III We then discuss how we will count tweets and retweets and compare our method with others in Section IV Finally in Section V we conclude the paper and discuss avenues for future work II R ELATED W ORK A number of recent studies have focused on examining the properties of the Twitter social network including calculating the inîuence of users Cha et al compared three measures of user inîuence indegree retweets and mentions The y rank ed users based on each inîuence measure and used a correlation measure to determine how closely related a pair of inîuence measures are They found that mentions and retweets were highly correlated meaning that users with many retweets are mentioned often and users with many mentions are retweeted often Indegree had a low correlation with both retweets and mentions indicating that the most connected users are not necessarily the most inîuential The above nding may seem counterintuitive If a user has a large audience shouldnêt that mean that she is highly inîuential The issue is that indegree measures the size of the audience for a particular user but does not measure whether any of the audience members are actually listening There are a few common practices in Twitter that may indicate why indegree is not a good measure of inîuence First some users follow a lot of other users but do not read all of those other users messages Second some users will reciprocally follow everyone who follows them but as in the rst example may not pay attention to all of the users they follow Kwak et al also used the number of followers and the number of retweets to rank Twitter users Additionally  they ranked users with the PageRank algorithm where the nodes were users and the directed edges represented one user following another They found that number of followers and PageRank gave similar rankings to the users We are not surprised by this nding because the PageRank method was based on the graph of followers Ranking users by the number of retweets provided a very different ranking of users than the other two methods Another study that used information propagation in Twitter as a measure of a userês inîuence tracked the spread of bit.ly URLês bit.ly is a URL shortening service through the graph of who follows whom in Twitter The y claim that this is a more inclusive measure of inîuence than using retweets because a user may see a URL in a message from someone they follow and then include that URL in a new tweet without acknowledging the source user Additionally tracking URLês gives an upper bound measure of inîuence because a user may independently post the same URL as one of the users she follows This study then examined what factors best predict future inîuence and found that individuals who have been inîuential in the past and have many followers are likely to be inîuential in the future The authors of the study note that the messages posted by these inîuential individuals will not always be inîuential because they found few deep message cascades in Twitter III M ETHODS Because prior work has indicated that the number of retweets may be a better measure of inîuence than the number of followers or other metrics we focus our calculation of inîuence on retweets We deviate from the prior work by focusing on the ratio of retweets per tweet instead of on the sheer number of tweets as was done by Cha et al and Kwak et al Our intuition is that the retweet to tweet ratio provides a better measure of overall inîuence For example a user could be a very proliìc tweeter by posting a large number of messages If each of these messages is retweeted once then this proliìc tweeter will have a high sheer number of retweets However her messages have not spread widely throughout the social network Another example where the sheer number of retweets may not be a good measure of inîuence is the case where one of a userês tweets is widely forwarded through the network but the rest of the userês tweets are not retweeted In this case the user does not generally have inîuential tweets only the single tweet that was very popular Using the retweet per tweet ratio as our measure of inîuence will be more likely to indicate that users who have many tweets that are highly retweeted are the most inîuential For a more formal deìnition of inîuence we consider an inîuential user to be one who has a high retweet per tweet ratio during the given time period Given the following terminology  Inîuence of user in a certain time period  The number of tweets written by user in a certain time period  The number of retweets of user s tweets in a certain time period Consider the inîuence of user during a certain time period to be the ratio of retweets to tweets Therefore deìne the inîuence of user during a certain time period as 1 In order to rank users by inîuence we normalize inîuence by dividing the inîuence of each user by the sum of the inîuences of all users Given the terminology above along with the following additional terminology

 Normalized user inîuence  total number of users Deìne the normalized inîuence of user during a certain time period as 2 In Section IV we will discuss how we will use the normalized user inîuence to rank Twitter users In order to test our method for ranking Twitter users based on retweets we need to count the tweets and retweets of those tweets for the currently active users The rst task is to identify the active users Therefore we use the Twitter Application Programming Interface API to gather information about current activity on Twitter and store this data in a relational database We are currently nalizing our data gathering programs and will begin data collection soon IV I MPLEMENTATION After collecting data from Twitter we will be ready to run our inîuence ranking program We will rank users by inîuence during a particular time period As we will discuss in Section V in the future we plan to examine how the top inîuential users uctuate over time During the speciìed time period we will nd all users who have posted an original message Next we will nd the number of times that each of the userês messages have been retweeted during the given time period Then we can use the methods discussed in Section III-A to compute the inîuence of each user and then rank the users by inîuence In order to count retweets we must rst identify messages as being retweets Twitter users utilize two different methods for retweeting the native retweet and the organic retweet In late 2009 Twitter added native functionality for retweets to its API This functionality adds a retweet button to each tweet when viewed in Twitterês graphical user interface When a user wishes to forward a tweet she clicks the retweet button on that tweet to forward the message to her followers The native retweet functionality gives retweets a uniform format and allows the API to provide methods for counting the number of retweets of a given tweet Prior to the addition of native retweet functionality and still to this day users employ a number of different organic retweeting practices These retweeting practices are called organic because they arose from within the Twitter community The most common practice is to add RT username to the beginning of the retweeted tweet where RT indicates that the tweet is a retweet and username tags the user who is being retweeted Other retweeting practices are used to indicate that the tweet has been signiìcantly altered by the retweeter or occurred simply because there was no standard protocol for retweeting Counting the number of native retweets is a simple matter of using Twitterês API The API provides a method that returns a list of the users who retweeted a particular tweet One limitation of this method is that we are unable to lter the retweeter list by time period Our inîuence calculation method considers the number of retweets per tweet during a speciìc time period We do not expect this to be problematic because previous studies of retweeting practices has shown that one half of retweets are posted within one hour 75 within one day and only 10 one month later In order to count organic retweets we must scan through the tweets we collected in our database and count the number of times we nd the RT username string for the given user Because our method of calculating inîuence counts retweets and tweets for a user instead of counting the retweets for a particular tweet we do not need to determine which of the userês tweets is being retweeted All we need is the count of the number of organic retweets of that user during the speciìed time period As stated above we simplify the identiìcation of organic retweets by only searching for the RT username syntax This simpliìcation means that we may miss some retweets that use alternative syntax for attributing the retweet Additionally we are not able to detect the fact that some users forward another userês message without attribution The possibility that we may miss some organic retweets is the tradeoff that we must accept when working with realÖworld data In order to evaluate the usefulness of our method of ranking Twitter users by inîuence we will compare our method with others that have been presented in the literature We will compare the similarity of the ranked lists generated by the different methods as will as the ease of implementation of the methods We may nd that different methods of ranking users by inîuence result in similar ranked lists of users In this case we will consider whether one method is easier to implement than the other On the other hand we might nd that different methods generate very different rankings of inîuential users This nding would require additional investigations to determine the causes of the difference The other ranking methods we will compare our method to are the ones that also consider retweets as a measure of inîuence 2 3 W e will compare the results my manually examining the top 20 users and by using a mathematical comparison 2 V C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK We have presented our preliminary work on ranking users in Twitter a directional social network by inîuence Our methods are similar to prior work in that we also consider message forwarding as the measure of inîuence However we use the ratio of the number of forwards of a userês messages to the number of messages posted by the user instead of the sheer number of times a userês messages have been forwarded

DN c3 the access latency between any DN and its assigned VM is not greater than t  and c4 the access latency between an arbitrary assigned VM and an arbitrary DN is not greater than 2 t  First note that each DN i  D  is assigned to a single VM and each VM j  V  is assigned to at most one DN since DN i  D  is assigned to VM j  V  if and only if e ij is in the matching M lines 18  20 and the matching M saturates all nodes in D  line 17 This implies c1 and c2 because D   D and V    j   i  D x  ij  0  V lines 22  29 In addition x  is an LP solution for the LP relaxation of 3tVMPDN line 12 x  must satisfy constraints in 3c and 3d If DN i is assigned to VM j  e ij is in M  E  lines 18  20 This implies x  ij  0 lines 30  34 According to constraints in 3c we have d ij  t  Thus c3 holds Besides consider an arbitrary DN i and an arbitrary assigned VM j  Then j  V   otherwise VM j cannot be assigned to any DN This implies  i  D x  ij  0 lines 25  29 According to constraints in 3d we have d ij  2 t  Hence we have c4 Lemma 2 The maximum access latency in any feasible solution of 3tVMPDN under the threshold t is at most 3 t  Proof Let assignment A be an arbitrary feasible solution of 3tVMPDN under the threshold t  Because the assignment A satisìes constraints in 3c the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM in the assignment A is not greater than t  It sufìces to show the maximum access latency among all pairs of assigned VMs in the assignment A is not greater than 3 t  Consider two arbitrary assigned VMs j and k  Let VM j be assigned to DN i in the assignment A  Then the access latency between VMs j and k is not greater than the access latency between VM j and DN i  L 1  plus the access latency between DN i and VM k  L 2  because the access latency satisìes the triangle inequality Since the assignment A satisìes constraints in 3c and 3d L 1  t and L 2  2 t  completing the proof Lemma 3 Any feasible solution of tVMPDN is a feasible solution of 3tVMPDN Proof Let assignment A be an arbitrary feasible solution of tVMPDN Then the assignment A must satisfy constraints in 2a 2b 2c 2d and 2e Since constraints in 2a 2b 2c and 2e are equal to constraints in 3a 3b 3c and 3e respectively We need only to show the assignment A satisìes constraints in 3d It sufìces to show that in the assignment A  the access latency between an arbitrary assigned VM j and an arbitrary DN i is at most 2 t  Let DN i be assigned to VM k in the assignment A If VM k is VM j  the access latency between DN i and VM j is at most t because the assignment A satisìes constraints in 2c otherwise the access latency between DN i and VM j is not greater than the access latency between DN i and VM k  L 1  plus the access latency between VM k and VM j  L 2  because the access latency satisìes the triangle inequality Because the assignment A satisìes constraints in 2c and 2d L 1  t and L 2  t  completing the proof Lemma 4 Procedure 1 is a polynomial-time algorithm Proof Clearly in polynomial time a bipartite graph can be constructed by Procedure 2 line 16 and an assignment of DNs to VMs can be made lines 18  20 Besides in polynomial time a matching in a bipartite graph can be found line 17 and a feasible LP solution x  for the LP relaxation of the input problem can be obtained by a polynomial-time LP algorithm line 12 Thus Procedure 1 can be executed in polynomial time Theorem 4 Algorithm 1 is a 3 approximation algorithm of VMPDN Proof Algorithm 1 executes Procedure 1 at most  E  times Since Procedure 1 can be executed in polynomial time by Lemma 4 Algorithm 1 can be executed in polynomial time Let d OP T be the maximum access latency in the optimal solution of VMPDN We need to show Algorithm 1 can always output an assignment of DNs to VMs with the maximum access latency of at most 3  d OP T  Clearly there is an edge in the input graph G of Algorithm 1 such that d OP T is equal to the weight of the edge In addition t is increased from the smallest to the greatest weight of the edges in G By Theorem 3 and Lemma 2 the maximum access latency in any assignment output by Procedure 1 is smaller than 3  d OP T as t<d OP T  Thus it sufìces to show that c1 Procedure 1 must output a feasible solution of 3tVMPDN as t  d OP T  Since d OP T is the maximum access latency in the optimal solution of VMPDN there is a feasible solution of tVMPDN as t  d OP T  By Lemma 3 there is a feasible solution of 3tVMPDN as t  d OP T  Thus by Theorem 3 c1 must hold IV O PTIMAL A PPROXIMATION A LGORITHM Theorem 1 indicates that an approximation algorithm with a factor smaller than two does not exist for VMPDN Here we propose a 2-approximation algorithm that is an optimal approximation algorithm for VMPDN The basic idea is to divide the original problem into  V  small problems compute a solution for each small problem and subsequently choose the best solution The steps are described in the following paragraphs First we divide VMPDN into  V  small problems Each small problem is a rooted version of VMPDN termed rVMPDN In other words in rVMPDN the set of the assigned VMs must contain a speciìc VM r  Clearly an algorithm for rVMPDN can be used to solve VMPDN by trying all possible  V  roots The mixed integer program of rVMPDN can be obtained from that of VMPDN by adding new constraints  i  D x ir 1  Then we obtain rVMPDN with a xed threshold t  termed trVMPDN using the threshold technique The integer program of trVMPDN can be obtained from that of tVMPDN by adding new constraints  i  D x ir 1  IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications 1307 


Next we need to remove the quadratic constraints in the integer program of trVMPDN that is   i  D x ij 1    i  D x ij 2   t  d j 1 j 2   0   j 1 j 2  V j 1   j 2  while ensuring that properties P1 and P2 described in Section III-A are satisìed Since removing the quadratic constraints could result in unbounded access latency between two assigned VMs we need to add constraints to ensure that the access latency between any two assigned VMs is bounded by 2 t  In order to do so we avoid that the access latency between VM r and an arbitrary assigned VM is greater than t by adding new constraints   i  D x ij   t  d rj   0   j  V  Note that because the access latency between any two assigned VMs are bounded by t in trVMPDN any feasible solution of trVMPDN satisìes the newly added constraints The integer program of the new problem termed 2trVMPDN is described as follows subject to  j  V x ij 1   i  D 4a  i  D x ij  1   j  V 4b x ij  t  d ij   0   i  D  j  V 4c   i  D x ij   t  d rj   0   j  V 4d  i  D x ir 1 4e x ij  0  1    i  D  j  V 4f  Algorithm 2 2 Approximation Algorithm for VMPDN Input A graph G  D  V E  with weights d ab associated with all e ab  E 35 Index all edges in E in a nondecreasing order of the weights 36 m  0  37 while m  E  do 38 m  m 1  39 t  the weight of the edge with index m  40 L min  2 t 1 41 for each VM r do 42 if Procedure 1 with input parameters G  t  and the constraints of 2trVMPDN i.e constraints in 4a  4f outputs an assignment A with the maximum access latency L  less than L min then 43 A min  A  44 L min  L  45 end if 46 end for 47 if L min  2 t then 48 Return the assignment A min  49 end if 50 end while 51 Return no feasible solution The proposed 2-approximation algorithm for VMPDN is described in Algorithm 2 Similar to Algorithm 1 Algorithm 2 increases the threshold t from the smallest to the greatest weight of the edges in the input graph G  Under a certain 19 10 10 10 19 10 0 1 2 3 10 19 28 20 19 19 19 28 10 19 36 10 19 1 0.5 19 19 10 19 10 0.5 19 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 0.5 1 2 3 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 b Fig 2 Example of Algorithm 2 a The input graph G  D  V E   b The constructed bipartite graph G   D   V  E    threshold t  Algorithm 2 divides VMPDN into  V  rVMPDN computes the assignment of the corresponding 2trVMPDN of each rVMPDN using Procedure 1 and outputs the assignment with the minimum of the maximum access latency if there is an assignment output by Procedure 1 lines 41  49 Example 2 Example of Algorithm 2 is illustrated in Fig 2 Initially t is set to 10 in line 39 As r    Procedure 1 cannot nd a feasible solution in line 42 because d j t 10 for each j  V    As r    a feasible LP solution x  for the LP relaxation of 2trVMPDN is obtained when executing Procedure 1 Note that x  i 0 for each i  D because d  28 t 10 and x  must satisfy constraints in 4d Algorithm 2 nally assigns DNs 1 2 and 3 to VMs     and   respectively Note that the maximum access latency in the assignment is 19  2 t 20   Clearly Algorithm 2 executes Procedure 1 at most  E  V  times thus Algorithm 2 can be executed in polynomial time by Lemma 4 In addition in any feasible solution of 2trVMPDN under the threshold t  the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM is not greater than t due to constraints in 4c and the maximum access latency among all pairs of assigned VMs is not greater than 2 t because the maximum access latency between VM r and any assigned VM is not greater than t due to constraints in 4d that is the maximum access latency in any feasible solution of 2trVMPDN under the threshold t is at most 2 t  Let d OP T be the maximum access latency in the optimal solution of VMPDN Then given that t  d OP T  at least one of  V  trVMPDN has a feasible solution Let trVMPDN with a speciìc VM r  have a feasible solution Since any feasible solution of trVMPDN is a feasible solution of 2trVMPDN based on the similar arguments of Lemma 3 2trVMPDN with a speciìc VM r  has a feasible solution as t  d OP T  Thus as t  d OP T and r  r   Procedure 1 must output a feasible solution of 2trVMPDN with the maximum access latency of at most 2  d OP T using the similar argument of Theorem 3 Since the threshold t is increased from the smallest to the greatest weight of the edges in G  the maximum access latency in the assignment output by Algorithm 2 is bounded by 2  d OP T  Thus we have Theorem 5 According to Theorem 1 Algorithm 2 is an optimal approximation algorithm for VMPDN We omit the proof of Theorem 5 due to its similarity with that of Theorem 4 IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications 1308 


Theorem 5 Algorithm 2 is a 2-approximation algorithm for VMPDN Speciìcally Algorithm 2 is an optimal approximation algorithm for VMPDN V T HE P ROBLEM V ARIANT We study the variation of VMPDN termed sVMPDN which is also introduced and shown not to admit any approximation algorithm with a factor smaller than two in The objecti v e of sVMPDN is to minimize the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM while ensuring that the maximum access latency among all pairs of assigned VMs maximum inter-VM latency is bounded by a speciìc value s  In other words sVMPDN bounds the maximum interVM latency at a speciìc value s  rather than minimizing it We can obtain the mixed integer program of sVMPDN from that of VMPDN by replacing constraints in 1e with   i  D x ij 1    i  D x ij 2   s  d j 1 j 2   0   j 1 j 2  V j 1   j 2  Similar to the design of the 2-approximation algorithm for VMPDN we introduce a new problem termed tr2sVMPDN with the integer program described in the following subject to  j  V x ij 1   i  D 5a  i  D x ij  1   j  V 5b x ij  t  d ij   0   i  D  j  V 5c   i  D x ij   s  d rj   0   j  V 5d  i  D x ir 1 5e x ij  0  1    i  D  j  V 5f Using a similar argument for sketching the proof of Theorem 5 as the constraints of tr2sVMPDN i.e constraints in 5a  5f instead of the constraints of 2trVMPDN are input to Procedure 1 Algorithm 2 can always output an assignment where the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM is not greater than t due to constraints in 5c and the maximum access latency among all pairs of assigned VMs is not greater than 2 s because the maximum access latency between VM r and any assigned VM is not greater than s due to constraints in 5d Thus with a slight modiìcation Algorithm 2 can obtain an optimal solution of sVMPDN through a violation of the maximum inter-VM latency constraint by a factor of at most two as described in Theorem 6 The proof of Theorem 6 is omitted due to its similarity with those of Theorems 4 and 5 Theorem 6 Algorithm 2 is a 1  2 approximation algorithm for sVMPDN if the constraints of tr2sVMPDN instead of the constraints of 2trVMPDN are input to Procedure 1 VI N

1 and 32  respectively in the construction of BCube Subsequently we randomly assign each of the DNs and available VMs to one rack where the numbers of the DNs and available VMs are 40 and 120 respectively To study the impact of the distribution of DNs and VMs on the performance of the proposed algorithms DNs and VMs are assigned to one of the rst 16 racks 64 racks 256 racks and 1,024 racks The access latency between a DN or VM and a VM is randomly chosen from the interval 0  9  1  1 times the estimated access latency between them The estimated access latency between a DN or VM and a VM is evaluated by the sum of the switch delay and the physical link delay The def ault size of a TCP pack et is 1,500 bytes Assume that the link bandwidth is 10Gbps Then the switch delay of transferring a TCP packet is approximately 1.214  s In addition between the node DN or VM and the access switch between the access switch and the aggregate switch and between the aggregate switch and the core switch the link lengths are approximately 10 m 25 m and 25 m respectively according to and thus the physical link delay of transferring a TCP packet is approximately 1.207  s 1.283  s and 1.283  s respectively according to 10 We evaluate the performance of Algorithms 1 and 2 on the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM and all pairs of assigned VMs In addition we compare our algorithms with the lower bound of the optimal solution  LB  evaluated by the smallest threshold t such that a feasible LP solution for the LP relaxation of 2trVMPDN can be obtained by Procedure 1 The empirical data is obtained by averaging the data of 100 assignment of racks to DNs and VMs for each network topology In addition we also evaluate the worst maximum ratios of the maximum access latencies of Algorithms 1 and 2 to LB among 100 assignment of racks to DNs and VMs Fig 3 shows that Algorithm 1 performs as well as Algorithm 2 in terms of the maximum access latency in almost all cases and that the maximum access latencies of Algorithms 1 and 2 approach LB  In addition broadly speaking as the rack range increases the maximum access latencies of Algorithms 1 and 2 tend to increase in all network architectures Speciìcally both Algorithms 1 and 2 have approximately the same maximum access latency as the rack range is 1  64 and 1  256 in Tree 1  64  1  256  and 1

factor equal to the known lower bound In the authors ar gue that the data locality may not be relevant anymore because with 100G or more adapters the performance bottleneck will be at the disk I/O rather than the network interface However unless we can avoid the oversubscription on the link capacities in the network inside a data center the network bottleneck can cause high access latency for remote data Moreover some researchers suggest that disks be replaced with ash memory or even DRAM as the primary storage in the future In such en vironments the performance bottleneck of data access could reemerge in the network interface and an efìcient VM placement algorithm continues to be required for minimizing the access latency between data and computation nodes VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we investigated the placement problem of VMs for DNs termed VMPDN and its variant termed sVMPDN which are initially introduced and shown not to admit any approximation algorithm with a factor smaller than two in  VMPDN asks for the assignment of DNs to VMs with the minimum maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM and among all pairs of assigned VMs such that each DN is assigned to a single VM and each VM is not assigned to more than one DN In sVMPDN the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM is minimized while ensuring that the maximum access latency among all pairs of assigned VMs maximum inter-VM latency is bounded To the best of our knowledge no approximation algorithms have been proposed for VMPDN and sVMPDN in the literature so far We initially proposed a 3-approximation algorithm Algorithm 1 and subsequently proposed a 2-approximation algorithm Algorithm 2 that is an optimal approximation algorithm for VMPDN in the price of higher time complexity Furthermore we also showed that with a slight modiìcation Algorithm 2 can become a 1  2 approximation algorithm for sVMPDN In other words Algorithm 2 can be slightly modiìed for obtaining an optimal solution of sVMPDN through a violation of the maximum inter-VM latency constraint by a factor of at most two We conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of Algorithms 1 and 2 based on four network architectures inside a data center including Tree VL2 Fat-Tree and BCube discussed in The simulation results sho wed that both Algorithms 1 and 2 make approximately optimal assignments of DNs to VMs In addition the simulation results also showed that although Algorithm 1 has a worse approximation factor Algorithm 1 performs as well as Algorithm 2 in terms of the maximum access latency in almost all cases R EFERENCES  Applying the cloud to big data storage Online A v ailable
