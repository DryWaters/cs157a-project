  Paper 2581 Version 2  8  As computer circuit features shrink toward atomic dimensions, which they have for decades in accordance with Moore's Law, the behavior of electrons changes from being like particles described by classical physics to being like waves described by quantum mechanics.  Quantum analogs for  many traditional memory and processing functions will be available at extremely small sizes and low power utilization  Advanced algorithms for data discovery and management information systems are rapidly increasing in complexity There are increasingly g reater volumes of data, users processes, and transactions with greater interdependencies between these components. Although the range of available storage, user interface, and computing devices is increasing the need for advanced data processing and mana gement systems is also increasing rapidly.  There are many advances currently which are fueled by internet services growth.  An example is Hadoop, with a 223map/reduce\224 algorithm, which distributes the application among many processors and databases. It is \223 open source\224 software that enables distributed parallel processing of huge amounts of data across inexpensive, commodity servers. The value proposition of Hadoop is to \223create solutions from big data.\224  The drivers behind all of this are the increasingly s ophisticated demands of the user. Where workers were once content to engage in data environments for simple communications and number crunching, the norm these days is a highly collaborative 223 always on 224  experience in which the entire relationship between individual and work environment is defined by the level of access to IT resources  Current research is not focused on making more information available, but on conserving scarce human attention so that it can focus on the information that is most importan t and most relevant to the decisions that have to be made. To do this, researchers are drawing upon artificial intelligence \(AI and using cognitive sciences to assess the information capabilities of human beings and how to best present the value added dat a  For example, Northrop Grumman has introduced an UAS  data management system to the European market, to allow troops on the ground to "eliminate the tunnel vision of the battlefield." The HART \(heterogeneous airborne reconnaissance team\ allows soldiers a t small unit level to benefit from the plethora of assets overflying the battlespace without their own UA S   IT Summary 227 Although forecasting specific technologies to emerge over 20 years is not productive, it can be stated that an IT revolution \(i.e., high processing power, large memory availability, along with advanced AI and cognitive based data processing systems\ will provide the technology enablers that UA S  markets require for rapid market expansion into the commercial and military fields. What remains  to be done to create an explosive worldwide UA S  markets is  to provide the regulatory enablers for allow ing  efficient operation of UA S s  4   U AS  MISSIONS  The example  UAS missions  surveyed in this study  can be described in a manner that permits rapid identifi cation of key traits required for mission accomplishment. UAS missions are so numerous in purpose and diverse in operational nature that it is best to describe their scope using a generalized and comprehensive classification scheme. We begin by listing the  descriptive dimensions of UAS missions at the highest level in the classification scheme. These dimensions include User Class, Mission Purpose, Scale of Mission, Control Paradigm, and Operational Characteristics all of which can be further decomposed int o sub headings indicating the major components of each dimension, e.g 223User Class\224 contains sub headings of Military, Public Commercial, and Private.  A third level of detail is provided through selection of specific elements with each subheading to com plete the description  In this mission classification scheme, the first two high level dimensions, User Class and Purpose, describe what is to be done and who is executing the mission This makes the classification method more valuable   because there ar e some  missions seeking  UAS capable of performing them while on the flipside there are  other highly developed  UAS  seeking  missions and user  bases  As such, t his mission classification method may be used in either direction 226  for mission planners to descri be the needed UAS capability or for UAS manufacturers to market a range of uses \(missions and users that could benefit from their existing UAS design having standardized characteristic definitions  The following sections briefly introduce the UAS mission  classification scheme  User Class  Military 227 This user class includes the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Special Operations units, Reserve and National Guard units, and the Coast Guard  Publi c 227 This user class includes governments and government agencies at  federal, state and local levels. State police and militias are in this class, as are local law enforcement agencies and other government services at all levels  Commercial 227 This user class includes all companies or business partnerships operating UAS or ca using them to be operated in the course of their business  Private 227 This class of users includes all individuals or groups of citizens operating UAS for recreation competition, or any other private endeavor  


  Paper 2581 Version 2  9  Mission Purpose  Intelligence, Surveillance, Rec onnaissance 227 This is one of the largest purpose categories. It is first broken into the type of surveillance sensor, such as visual, infrared, radio frequency   or other electromagnetic field measurements Next, it is described by the field of view in the mi ssion, such as large \(bigger than a building\ or small. Within these descriptors, large field of view missions may be sensed all at once \(simultaneous\ or sequentially. Small field of view missions are described as having a fixed or a moving objective, suc h as a person or vehicle. The update rate of the surveillance can range from a single snapshot to a high speed motion picture and everything in between. The final descriptor is the latency of the data received by the operator  Payload Delivery 227 T his catego ry includes cargo transport and a number of classifying descriptors such as \223single point delivery\224, \223distributed delivery\224, \223find and deliver.\224  Environmental 227 The Environmental mission purpose includes measuring, monitoring some parameter, or altering the environment in some fashion. Meteorological sensing noise monitoring, climate monitoring, and the measurement of atmospheric aerosols are all examples of this mission purpose category  Search and Rescue 227 Search and Rescue is a specialized mission that is n ow mainly search in support of a rescue mission. Eventually it will involve finding and retrieving  persons or objects and returning them to a designated point  Training 227 The Training mission purpose cuts across all users, scales, and most control paradigms Training refers not just to the remote pilots of UAS but to other \223mission specialists\224 who will control aspects of the mission other than manipulating or directing the UAS vehicle itself  Pilot Augmentation 227 UAS technologies for controlling aircraft aut onomously may be applied to manned aircraft in a manner to replace one of the pilots and still maintain the required safety in the event of incapacitation of the remaining pilot. This could significantly improve the safety of existing single pilot operatio ns as well as provide large cost savings to current operations which now require two pilot crews  Relay 227 The purpose of Relay missions is to relay communications to or from a location that is otherwise incapable of communicating  Robotics 227 UAS may perform robotic control of remote agents. This could be to retrieve something that first has to be disconnected or to manipulate a remote object in some fashion to enable it to perform its function. This purpose could be called \223find and fix.\224  Rec reation 227 In terms of pure numbers, most UAS, until recently have been radio controlled models built and flown by hobbyists. These have become increasingly sophisticated over the years as all of the required technologies have matured and become smaller, ligh ter, and less expensive  Unique Specialized Missions 227 The Unique Specialized Mission category is a catch all for one of a kind missions that do  not  fit well with the broader categories but are nonetheless important in their own right  Scale of Mission  Geo graphic Size 227 Geographic size describes the physical size of the area of operation or mission coverage  Temporal Extent 227 Temporal extent describes the timing aspects of the mission. Some missions may be \223out and back\224 with no time spent at the destination o ther than to deliver the payload, collect the data, or make a marketing appearance. Other missions require a long loiter time waiting to detect an event or to monitor for a slow change in some observed variable  Payload Size 227 Payload size refers to the wei ght of anything carried by the UAS other than the lift and propulsion systems. More than anything else, this element will determine the physical size of the UAS  Cost  The cost of the mission is that part of the cost/benefit equation that determines the ec onomic viability of any UAS mission. Cost includes use of the vehicle\(s\, the supporting control and communications infrastructure, and the launch and recovery areas and systems  Control Paradigm  As discussed earlier, the control paradigms  which must be considered while selecting a UAS for a mission are   Remote Human Pilot 226  Real Time Flight Control   Remote Human Pilot 226  Mission Objectives Only   Human Controlled Initiation / Termination 226  Autonomous Execution   Multi Vehicle Cooperative Control   Operational Characteristics  Multi User Airport 227 Those missions that involve the transport of cargo or, eventually, people, will want to share the groundside infrastructure that already exists at current airports for handling and processing these payloads  Using shared airports also simplifies the often extensive and expensive approval processes required to gain access to new operating areas  Private Use STOL Facility 227 With modest real estate requirements, a short field runway with supporting 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  10  command and cont rol facilities can be established to provide greater operational security without the complication of traffic integration at a joint use airport during launch and recovery operations  Fling and Snare 227 Some missions may use a vehicle that requires forward mo tion for generating lift, but may be catapulted into the air and snared during recovery without damaging the vehicle or its contents during a landing  Line of Si ght 227 This operational characteristic requires that the vehicle be in sight of the operator throu ghout the mission. While simplifying control links and operational approvals, it severely limits the utility of most missions  Telemetry 227 The amount of telemetry required is often inversely proportional to the degree of autonomy of mission control describe d above. The more autonomous the UAS is in performing its mission, the lower the requirement for telemetry during the mission   Class G Airspace Only 227 Mission operations carried out exclusively in Class G airspace face the smallest approval hurdles from the standpoint of air traffic integration. It is legal even today to fly manned aircraft in instrument meteorological conditions IMC   in Class G airspace without an ATC clearance  Class A through E Airspace with Traffic Integration 227 It is difficult for a UAV to know whether it is flying in Visual Meteorological Conditions VMC   or IMC Therefore, most missions will have to be presumed to be in IMC and operate under IFR when in controlled airspace. This operational characteristic place s a tremendous burden on the UAS operator by having to participate in the ATC process, even when the launch and recovery of the mission is non interfering    5  E CONOMICS  Business models are a method of describing  what the business does and how it generates revenue The model tells the story of the business and how the elements of that business work together to produce value that a customer would want. The model also describes how the business differentiates itself from other competition in the same  product area   7    T h i s st o r y o f  b u s i n e ss h e l p s o t h e r s  understand the business, is useful in securing capital for business growth, and provides a way of categorizing a particular business relative to other businesses and its competitors  Business models h ave been shown to be more predictive of revenue than other classical classifications of a business 2005, Peter Weill et. al As such, we have adopted an approach that makes use of business models to test a range of approaches for generation of revenue for UAS applications  Civil Businesses  With such a rapid growth in UAS for military applications it is logical that many of the civil benefits will flow from military applications. However, over time, UAS will create its own unique civil applications For development of the civil business models, the following opportunities have been chosen   Direct Transfer of Military Application to Civil Use  226  Cargo delivery, where stocks are delivered to remote locations to support construction and where resupply is performed for offshore oil platforms   Modification of Military Application to Civil Use  226  Police operations, both in Intelligence  Surveillance  and Recognizance   ISR   and in supplement or replacement of civil flight operations by law enforcement   Modificat ion of Civil Manned Application to Unmanned  226  Power line and pipeline inspections   Modification of Civil Terrestrial Activity to UAS  226  Agriculture crop monitoring for application of fertilizer pesticides, and watering   UAS Unique Civil Applications  226  1 Augmented flight assistance, leveraging optionally piloted aircraft technologies to improve safety and reduce the need for redundant pilot staffing, and \(2\ media communications relays at high altitude   For this study, the business modeling approach used is mobile application to do the characterizing businesses.

  Paper 2581 Version 2  11  These nine attribu tes have been used in this study to define a limited set of business models for civil use of UAS as a means of demonstrating the utility of business modeling Each of these attributes illustrates  a particular application or grouping of applications for use  of UAS.  Multiple current and near future applications are being considered, including    1  D elivery of cargo in remote areas 226  UAS offer efficiencies in terms of access, productivity timeliness, and potentially service quality   2  P olice operations 226  UAS use in DoD surveillance operations has created a market opportunity for similar use in civilian markets   3  Power line and pipeline inspection 226  Long distance detailed inspections requiring extensive hovering or repeated fly bys for inspection of worn components are well suited for execution with UAS   4  Agricultural use for management of crops and livestock 226  A UAS fitted with visual and IR sensors can fly over farm fields and locate pests weeds, and diseases, significantly improving the application of pesticides a t reduced loading to the crops and soil   5  Augmented flight assistance for manned flight 226  Business opportunities in this category range from transfer of technology from UAS experience to the cockpit to provide the pilot with a pilot\222s assistant to Optionall y Piloted Aircraft \(OPA\ where the aircraft is capable of human piloted and autonomous flight   and  6  Communications media relay 226  A UAS stays on station and provides the ability to connect users with a ground station for distribution of information to a lar ger customer base   Business model canvases have been created for each of the six applications cited above.  Fictitious companies were used; however, plausible circumstances, company relationships, and market opportunities were generated  to maximize relevance  Technology Transfer  The U.S. Government, especially through the D oD has made a significant investment to produce unmanned aircraft While less reliable than civilian certified manned aircraft these flying platforms are primaril y used to replace manned missions where risks are high or to provide an \223eye in the sky\224 extending the reconnaissance capabilities of the soldier on the ground. Long loiter times for sensors have proven their worth in battle areas. Patrol capabilities to s eek and detect threats have significantly improved both the vehicles and the sensors they carry  The market value is in the applications, not the aerial platform. The technology transfer that is needed is the adaptation of military technology for civilian  applications the freeing up of flight restrictions to stimulate application development, and the generation of revenue in the private sector through delivery of new ways of gathering information and converting that information for commercial use 227 whether  to reduce cost of existing activities or create new opportunities  Technology transfer can be divided into two major categories:  the transfer of aviation technology to manned flight, and the transfer of sensor technologies for adaptation in the civil mar ket  Aviation Technology 227 this is mainly  technology deployed in avionics  i.e systems that control flight, provide navigation, and support systems monitoring  Some examples of short term technology transfer opportunities include   Small autopilots that can be adapted for use in general aviation aircraft to improve performance and offer value added features at lower cost. The technology transfer is geared toward adapting autonomous flight opportunities from UASs to general aviation a ircraft   Sense and avoid technologies could aid general aviation safety, since most general aviation aircraft do not carry collision avoidance systems   Fuel and engine management systems used for optimizing loiter can be added to a Pilot Assistant for man ned aircraft  Autonomy must pass a major hurdle, that of attaining what the Air Force calls \223certifiable trust in autonomy.\224 The processes for certification are an area of joint collaboration between the military and civil sectors. New methods of Verifica tion and Validation \(V&V\ will be needed, and this V&V must be certifiably reliable, meaning there are scientific and engineering processes to prove performance  Sensor Technology 227 Electro optical video and IR, synthetic aperture radars, ground penetrating  radars, laser targeting systems make up the suite of current sensors. T he trend is to  produce the same or better performance with less system weight systems. This is coupled with the use of signal and information processing to improve the product sensing  for the operator. Approximately 80 percent of the commercial market will be realized in small UASs, where weight is a key factor. The vast majority of the users of the information the sensors capture will not be for a warfighter mission Therefore, inform ation presentation in usable forms will be essential to commercial success  Mapping technologies will need to be adapted to accept UAS derived information. The fight track, the sensor data and the underlying mapping must merge in order to realize the ben efits of sensor payloads on UAS. The technology transfer is a combination of information registry and visualization coupled with greater virtual reality

While the initial market will be in producing the flying pl atform and its sensors, the longer term market is in the information the sensors produce. When coupled with detailed mapping information through a geographical information system \(GIS new opportunities are created, from the farmer or rancher, to the larg e timber company, to water management authorities, to any case where a business involves land use  While most of the UAS industry is focused on a derivative of current military uses for security and police operations the civil industry is looking to use the UAS as a platform to produce revenue from the data derived through the sensors  Taking a longer view, the benefits are clear   Lower labor costs to accomplish tasks that are now performed by manned flight     Lower labor costs through a faster way to aut onomously gather information needed     Lower labor costs in land use field surveys and management    Greater use of information to manage application of water, fertilizers, pesticides, timing of crop harvests and management to produce greater yields \(from cor n to timber    Improvements in water management and allocation through use of GIS technologies paired with UAS sensor information    Reduced cost of environmental oversight and enforcement    Improved public safety through surveillance    Improved flight safety t hrough technology transfer from UAS to manned flight operations    Recognition of UAS flights as a data collection tool with the market driven by the information gained   Ease of operation to attain the data through information processing and presentation   The commercialization of UAS technology  and its capability to collect surveillance information  is limited by constraints imposed by the federal regulatory actions aviation\ and by general citizen concern over law enforcement applications of surveillance a nd the right to privacy. Both of these barriers will be overcome, but not without an impact on the economics of UAS. This delay will likely defer commercialization benefits and present additional obstacles to market entry  6  M ARKET B ARRIERS  Legal and Regulatory Policies and Procedures  The anticipated expansion of UAS into a myriad of public private, and commercial missions routinely using the national airspace alongside other air traffic has highlighted both the UAS operational needs and the public co ncerns associated with those operations. The Federal Aviation Authority\222s FAA's   Interim Operational Approval Guidance 08 01  gives the rules for gaining approval to operate UAS in the NAS and the operating limitations that are imposed on those flights. In  general, the rules for manned aircraft governing vehicle airworthiness, pilots maintenance, and use of the airspace have been directly applied to UAS operations with the caveat that relaxation of some of these rules may be granted if FAA accepts an opera tor proposed safety case using the regulatory process known as Alternate Methods of Compliance." Lacking that the UA S  must meet equivalent certification standards usually experimental category\, and be flown by a licensed pilot. Except in Class A airspa ce, UAS must be flown in VMC in sight of the pilot or, if a chase plane is used, in sight of the observer. UAS are to be maintained like a manned aircraft. All UAS flights in the NAS require a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization \(COA\, typically valid f or up to a year, obtained by submitting an application and receiving specific approval by the FAA  T he time and cost barriers these policies and procedures place in the way of achieving UAS benefits  are well documented Efforts are under way at FAA and th rough the RTCA Special Committee s  203  and 228  to create standards specifically for UAS of varying size and sophistication and for realistic operating procedures which would permit using their unique capabilities while still safeguarding the public Once in  place, these new standards will eliminate the time consuming COA process  Social Issues  Even when these technical and safety concerns are overcome, there is still a growing barrier to widespread use of UAS in the NAS brought on by the public's privacy con cerns. The most widely used mission for UAS is ISR, or more simply, surveillance. As many missions provide low altitude, high resolution surveillance, the privacy rights of citizens caught collaterally in the surveillance, must be protected  Articles in th e popular press have conjured up visions of thousands of prying eyes in the sky watching every move a person makes and continuously advising the authorities of individual's locations and activities. Even though a pro UAS bill was recently passed mandating the FAA to integrate UAS into the NAS by 2015   the government will also have to deal with the public's concern over privacy and the fears created by seeing numerous drones overhead, often at low altitude, regardless of how noble the purpose of their missio n  


  Paper 2581 Version 2  13  Environmental Impacts  Many proposed UAS missions identified earlier would place the vehicles in close proximity to persons who are not directly involved in the UAS operation. Civilian store deliver ies for example, could require a package drop off in cl ose vicinity to populated areas  The noise produced by the UAV being close to people could mean the difference between the success or failure of this type of business  Helicopters are notoriously loud noise producers Additionally, their blades are hazardous to be around. The wind produced by their hovering lift can also be strong enough to damage articles that are not either heavy or tied down. The fumes and gaseous e missions produced by the powerplants will be subject to the same environmental scrutiny  of all other transportation appliances and vehicles  Larger payloads and long endurance can be achieved quietly using lighter than air \(LTA\ or hybrid LTA vehicles with  multi mode propulsion capabilities. The lift required to keep large payloads aloft is not obtained aerodynamically, but through buoyancy, which is completely silent. This lift also produces no emissions, so if the thrust can be hybrid electric, most envir onmental concerns can be overcome.  A hybrid turbine electric propulsion system may also be capable of providing low noise periods of flight before and after which batteries are re charged.  The basic idea is that a battery powered ducted fan eliminates th e need for noisy gearboxes to operate during a noise sensitive leg of flight D Star Engineering is prototyping such a capability with funding from the I ntelligent Advanced research Projects Agency \(I ARPA   Other  There are other more subtle potential barri ers to acceptance of widespread use of UAS in the NAS Cost is still a significant factor for all but recreational radio controlled models. The costs of even experimental certification, pilot and mechanic training, salaries for pilots, mechanics, and other  mission specialists needed to carry out a drone mission, and the still relatively poor accident record for UAS, which can result in total loss of the expensive vehicles, are all substantial  Insurance costs for UAS operations over cities and towns are st ill being determined as actuarial data is slowly accumulated.  No matter how quiet or clean it is, the sight of a large vehicle passing overhead where none had been before may  draw complaints and political pressure to restrict or ban their operations  This  is not to suggest that these barriers cannot be overcome to the benefit of many domestic civil and military UAS missions. The concerns need to be understood and addressed so that their potential to stop the use of UAS is neutralized The technical barrier s are much simpler to overcome than the political and social ones, so continuous public education about the benefits of UAS use and the measures taken to ensure the safety and privacy of the general public is essential  7   UAS  F UTURE F ORECASTS  From resourc es reviewed during the study, the team developed the two forecasts: one for the military and public growth of  UAS  Figure 5  and one for the growth in civil use UAS  Figure 6  Under the FAA perspective   the definition of \223public\224 means federal agencies, s tate and local government organization \(including law enforcement and public universities These curves represent market 223demand\224 projections   Figure 5 2015 2035 Forecast for UAS DoD and Public  UAS   Figure 6 2015 2035 Forecast for Total Public and  Commercial UAS  8   C ONSTRAINTS AND I NFLUENCES ON UAS  T ECHNOLOGY  The technical team participating in the study  identified  listing of the top factors  that most likely will constrain UAS growth   These factors are  integrated functions drawn from the study areas when view ed as total system. The top six were determined to be of the most interest   Communication, Command and Control  needs to ensure pilot operators and air traffic controllers have clear, concise, and timely communications

These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
