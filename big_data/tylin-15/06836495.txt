valuable methodology in this context since it allows delimiting and exploring a complex parameter space in a transparent and relatively easily visualized manner With timely analyses it is possible to identify both technical and economic risks and minimize the possible consequences a process that bene\002ts both parties in the negotiation process This paper describes a part of this process in connection with the negotiation of a PBL contract for the Swedish Air Force SAAB 105 SK 60 trainer 003eet between Saab AB and the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration FMV The information used in the simulations was largely empirical data derived from previous operations of the aircraft system The main factors that were simulated were operational requirements 003eet size spares inventories turn-around times failure rates and in\003uence of extraneous factors e g weather The simulations resulted in considerable 
savings due to reduction of the active 003eet size and increased reclamation of surplus spares and units from retired aircraft T ABLE OF C ONTENTS 1 I NTRODUCTION                                   1 2 B ACKGROUND                                    2 3 T ECHNICAL F LEET

978-1-4799-1622-1/14 31  00 c 015 2014 IEEE IEEEAC Paper 2668 Version 1.03 Updated 10/01/2014 1 I NTRODUCTION Highly capital-intensive systems and associated 003eets such as a military aircraft 003eet have in most cases very long operational life-cycles and their stakeholders expect them to exhibit the necessary operational and performance characteristics throughout these long operational life spans However the actual results for the availability of the 003eets have often been less than satisfactory and the Life Cycle Cost LCC too high which has led many to envisage alternative approaches to more effectively sustain such complex systems and support systems Among the alternative approaches is Performance-Based 
Logistics/Performance-Based Contracting PBL/PBC whose essence is to de\002ne key system readiness and effectiveness criteria and to contract for threshold values of these criteria The notion of PBL originates from the United States military in 2001 see The emphasis on PBL is contracting for results and readiness levels and not for resources as has traditionally been the case This would represent a transition from telling the contractors what to do and how to do it to telling the contractor what to achieve and then relying on their knowledge and experience to do it while having the contractual incentives and penalty clauses in place to provide the necessary economic motivation see 5 The scope of a PBL contract of course varies from scenario to scenario it can be implemented in varying scales from a complete system to just a part of a sub system or a speci\002c 
support activity e.g providing maintenance spare parts etc see 3 7 Moreo v er  PBL can be applied to the whole lifecycle of a system as well as to a part of the life-cycle A disadvantage of implementing PBL partially i.e not to a whole system may be that opportunities for economies of scale might be lost Furthermore de\002ning performance measurements can be complicated if the supplier is only responsible for the performance of a part of the complete system see for a discussion In most PBL business cases regarding a complex technical system and their associated 003eets and support systems issues such as Reliability Maintainability and Supportability R M and S are included into some context 1 


The basic reason for this is that R M and S drive the operational effectiveness of a technically complex system such as an aircraft 003eet and play a crucial role in the negotiating process entering a PBL business scenario see Figure 1 for relations between R M and S adopted from Figure 1  Relationship Between Three Important Key Performance Requirements for PBL A key component of any PBL implementation is the establishment of metrics Since the purpose of PBL is buying performance what constitutes performance must be de\002ned in a manner in which the achievement of performance can be tracked measured and assessed 2 7 The supplier and the customer must agree on performance variables and metrics de\002nitions of the variables and metrics target values and how to perform measurements and analyses The performance variables should be speci\002c straightforward measurable and relevant to the customer's requirements 8 Selecting performance v ariables that re\003ect customer value is challenging since the customer's needs are often formulated in abstract terms 15 Commonly  se v eral performance variables are used in a PBL contract for example availability reliability maintainability supportability logistics response time logistic footprint and cost of usage  The v ariables can be used at dif ferent system le v els and address different aspects For example reliability can address a component component reliability a system system reliability or the system's performance mission reliability  Availability of e.g an aircraft is a highly aggregated variable dependent on many less aggregated variables It is dif\002cult to track improvements or problems by only observing the aircraft availability Performance variables at a lower level are therefore required 7 11 Moreo v er  if the supplier is responsible for the availability of some components the supplier cannot be held responsible for the availability on an aggregated level as the supplier is unable to control all factors affecting the availability Ho we v er  it should be noted that achieving performance goals on a lower level does not guarantee good system performance When a supplier and customer enters the negotiating process of a PBL business case it is crucial that both sides have a mutual understanding of the PBL framework i.e the range of systems included the risks involved the metrics the time frame of the contracts the availability of systems the possible options involved and the associated costs De\002ning and agreeing on a framework for a PBL contract is normally a complex issue where a simulation model could provide both the customer and the supplier with a better understanding of the consequences of the contract By analyzing the scenario in advance and during the negotiating process both the supplier and customer will be able to develop the best possible contract for both parties The most obvious application using simulation as a tool during the negotiating process would be to 002nd the right performance level based on the operational needs and the risks and costs associated with meeting the performance levels However de\002ning the performance level is not enough the agreed performance level also needs to be supported by a reward or penalty model that provides incentives for the supplier to meet the objectives 2 B ACKGROUND The focus in this paper is the use of a Monte Carlo based Simulation during the negotiation process for setting up a PBL business case for an aircraft 003eet the methodology will be illustrated using empirical data from the Saab 105 003eet referred to as the SK 60 003eet which is the Swedish Air Force designation The idea is to use the simulation to gain understanding about the operational pro\002le ensure that required availability will be ful\002lled and perform sensitivity analysis on parameters such as failure rates and turn-around times The study done is this paper is based on a real business case between Saab AB and the Swedish Air Force The used data is empirical material from the SK 60 aircraft 003eet and the transition of maintenance and support for SK 60 from the Swedish Air Force to the industry partner and aircraft manufacturer Saab AB The business case between Saab AB and FM Swedish Armed Forces is based on a PerformanceBased Contract Power by the Hour where Saab AB has undertaken to provide a certain number of operational aircraft at a number of air bases at set times The main rationale for the changeover to a PBL solution was that the FM needed to cut costs and that SK 60 was seen as a suitable test-bed for a Performance-Based business case This was based on the fact that SK 60 is a major system that it has little commonality with other FM aircraft systems and that the remaining life of the system was relatively short which made it possible to conclude an agreement that applied to the entire remaining life of the system Furthermore the fact that SK 60 is not a combat system simpli\002ed matters For a combat system a number of factors connected to national security and combat readiness but not directly related to costs and pro\002tability would have greatly complicated an agreement What makes this PerformanceBased business case somewhat special is that the SK 60 003eet is simultaneously approaching the end of its life-cycle It should be noted that while this paper is written around an Aerospace example the methodology and technique is equally applicable when entering the negotiating process for any other technical system where Reliability Maintainability and Supportability are key issues as well 3 T ECHNICAL F LEET SK 60 is a two-seat twin-engine aircraft that is used both as a primary and advanced trainer by the Swedish Armed Forces It is also used as a weather reconnaissance aircraft and for communication duties in a four-seat con\002guration A total of 150 aircraft were built by Saab AB for the Swedish Air Force under the Air Force designation SK 60 and delivered in 1966-68 When the process of negotiation started there were 82 aircraft remaining in service and accumulating an average of 030 6,500 003ight hours per year The complete aircraft system consists of 030 20 000 parts and is planned to remain in service at least through 2017/2020 4 D ATA C OLLECTION With business solutions such as PBL it becomes increasingly important to ensure dependability of the whole aircraft 003eet and perform availability reliability maintainability and maintenance support analyses based on the often heterogeneous data sets that are generated during the life-cycles of airborne platforms and their support systems 2 


Consequently it is essential that correct information can be quickly and reliably extracted from the often noisy and heterogeneous operational data to enable continuous analysis as decision-support for proactive Life Cycle Management LCM during the whole life-cycle on the importance of reliability databases and discovery knowledge methods see 17 It is not unusual for PBL-based business cases to be implemented for systems that have already been in service for a while or even as for the SK 60 003eet are approaching the end of their life-cycle During the bidding process historical data on operations and maintenance of the aircraft 003eet and supporting systems are very valuable for predicting the future behavior of the 003eet and estimate the future reliability availability and costs both for operations and maintenance Examples of such estimates include 017 Technical Related Data 226 Con\002guration of A/C versions 226 Failure rates MTBF on component and system levels 226 Cost for repairables spare parts and consumables etc 017 Maintenance Related Data 226 Repair times for units and system on A/C 226 Maintenance Schedule for complete A/C 226 Resources such as technicians etc 226 Mutual support between operational sites 226 Permissibility of cannibalization of aircraft 017 Support Organization Related Data 226 Transportation pro\002les 226 Batched transports 226 Reorder policy for spare parts 017 Operational Related Data 226 Operational pro\002les for each A/C version 226 Preparation/Turn-Around time for each A/C version 5 B USINESS C ASE The main reason FM wanted to outsource the operation of the SK 60 003eet was to decrease operational costs and as a trial of the PBL concept that would also since the system is near the end of its life-cycle automatically be limited in duration Before and during the contract negotiations between Saab AB FMV and FM a very important consideration particularly from Saab's point of view was whether all 82 aircraft had to be kept in service to provide the number of operational aircraft FM required If it was to prove possible to transfer some of the aircraft to long-term storage and still ful\002l the operational requirements with the remaining aircraft a major saving in costs would be possible Negotiating Process of a PBL Contract SK 60 Fleet The prerequisite in the SK 60 case is that the Service Provider Saab AB is very knowledgeable about the customers FM operations both 003ight operations and maintenance activities Further being the Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM of the aircraft SK 60 and much of the support infrastructure Saab AB also has very good knowledge about the technical system including the MIS Maintenance Information System and the historical operational and maintenance data available from it Given this the opportunities for analysing a variety of scenarios before and during the bidding phase in order to minimize the technical and economic risks were quite good These analyses were aimed at ensuring delivery of operational aircraft and to elucidate the potential for improvement in connection with the PBL commitment Not least important was to determine an effective Life Cycle Management LCM strategy for the complete commitment since the SK 60 003eet is expected to be phased out in the medium term and careful long-term planning of the maintenance can yield large cost savings during a phase-out process One example of an analysis was to determine more precisely how large an active 003eet was actually required to ful\002ll the FM's operational requirements Before submitting a de\002nitive bid several different analyses were carried out to study whether the number of active aircraft could be decreased without compromising the required availability To verify that it was possible to cope with fewer active aircraft than the 82 that were used by the FM availability studies were done for the whole support organization using a variety of tools and methods In this study we focus on the tools OPUS and SIMLOX By doing a variety of sensitivity analyses with these tools it is possible to determine 003eet availability for a variety of initial conditions both for the technical system and the support organization e.g turn-around-times TAT transport times storage facilities etc Of particular importance in this context is 003ight time generation for the Flying School since the progress of the pilot trainees is completely dependent on aircraft availability Availability Requirements At each main AFB Air Force Base F7 F17 F21 and the Flying School Saab AB undertakes to provide serviceable aircraft that enables the operator to carry out at least 95  of the mutually scheduled sorties 6 M ONTE C ARLO S IMULATION Coincident with starting the Bidding Process analyses of operations maintenance and logistics were initiated this in order to create an overview of the current situation and enable prognostication of availability and maintenance actions When bidding started the operator FM had 82 SK 60 in four versions A B C och D available During the bidding process simulation was an important tool particularly with regard to three main issues 017 A primary issue was if it was actually necessary to keep 82 aircraft in active operation or whether the number of active aircraft could be reduced and the surplus aircraft mothballed and/or used as a source of spares 017 Identifying technical bottlenecks and critical units 017 In\003uence of turn-around-times and unit failure rates on 003eet availability If decreasing the number of active aircraft was practicable it would enable considerable savings on maintenance and spares procurement To verify whether this was possible a number of simulations and optimization analyses were carried out To do this a model including the four sub-\003eets SK 60 A B C D the con\002guration of each aircraft version and a proposed support solution including maintenance logistics storage sites workshops and operational sites was de\002ned The simulations were then carried out using this model refer to Figure 2 for an outline of the used model and part of the aircraft con\002guration for SK 60A and Figure 3 for operational pro\002le for the Flying School at Malmen As can be seen in Figure 2 below a total of 45 SK 60 are currently dispersed to 002ve main sites operational or maintenance sites 3 


Figure 2  Support/Operation Organization to Left Part of the System Structure of the SK 60A version to the Right Figure 3  Weekly Operational Pro\002le for the Flying School The speci\002ed operational requirement is 6,800 003ight hours per annum for the 003eet as a whole which is then broken down in detail for the various sites with detailed operational pro\002les i e number of aircraft in the air at the same time number of 003ights per day 003ight duration etc Refer to Figure 3 for a typical weekly Mon.-Fri operational pro\002le for the Flying School at Malmen In Figure 3 the total volume of 003ight operations for the Flying School is also shown 4267 003ight hours per year This annual total operational time is spread relatively evenly over the year but there are some periods of more intense activity e g when a new intake of trainees arrives and there is normally a pause in operations during summer holidays In order to obtain realistic results parameters such as turnaround times for repairable/maintainable units exchange times maintenance intervals transport times stock levels etc must also be considered refer to for further information on input data The results for this scenario are presented in Figure 4 In the graph the number of aircraft has been decreased from 82 to 45 and existing stock levels have been increased by partedout units from the 37 aircraft that are not kept operational The simulation time is set to one year and both cannibalization and borrowing between operational sites are permitted when this increases the number of operational aircraft The same conditions are used in Figure 4 and Figure 5 below except that in Figure 5 the failure intensity for all units have been increased by 50  Figure 4  Accumulated Mission Time over one Year for the whole SK 60 Fleet 45 Aircraft 4 


A simulation 50 runs giving the average number of successful sorties green area generated by the whole 003eet i.e 45 Aircraft during a year is shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 and Figure 5 also shows a number of sorties that were started but not classi\002ed as successful since the sorties were aborted due to technical reasons the red area In this particular simulation these amounted to 030 5 in Figure 4 and 030 7 in Figure 5 A performance similar to the graph in Figure 4 would on average satisfy the required 003eet availability for the various operational sites However as shown in Figure 5 a 50  increase in failure rates for all units in the aircraft system would impact availability enough to imperil ful\002llment of the contracted requirements As the aircraft age and components become more worn an increasing number of units and system can be expected to enter the wear-out period in the socalled bathtub curve resulting in increasing failure rates This expected effect must be watched for and acted on early in order to avoid 003eet availability problems in the future In short it was found to be possible to reduce the active 003eet by about 37 aircraft and to use these as a source of additional units in stock By parting out units it is also possible to plan for stopping maintenance once there are suf\002cient units in stock for the remaining system life This however will only be possible once a de\002nitive phase-out date for the 003eet has been decided Figure 5  Accumulated Mission Time over one Year for the whole SK 60 Fleet 45 Aircraft with a increased Failure Rate for all units with 50  In the same way that it is important to study how changes in failure intensity affects 003eet availability it is also relevant to study how the TAT:s both for corrective and preventive maintenance affects availability By changing parameters in the same way as for failure rate in the simulation model the results in Figure 6 below is obtained As can be seen in Figure 6 a 50  increase of all TAT s have approximately the same effect on 003eet availability as a similar increase of the failure rates From Figure 5 and 6 it is clear that it is quite important to continuously track parameters such as failure rates and TAT in order to forestall problems In this connection simulation is one of several applicable tools Figure 6  Accumulated Mission Time over one Year for the whole SK 60 Fleet 45 Aircraft with a 50  increase in Turn-Around-Time TAT for all units Another key question concerns critical units i e to identify units likely to cause back-orders By using simulations it is possible to identify which units have the potential to affect the availability at aircraft level refer to Figure 7 below Each bar represents a speci\002c type of unit Back-orders can occur due to a number of factors e g a physical shortage of units but also because of long Turn-around Times TAT a high failure intensity or logistic delays indeed the reason is usually a combination of these factors Figure 7 also yields information of which units should be parted-out from inactive aircraft and used to service the active 003eet Figure 7  Units on Hand or in Resupply and Back-orders 7 M EASUREMENTS OF E FFICIENCY Performance is a central part of PBL as performance re\003ects customer value and forms the basis for the supplier's income Therefore measuring performance accurately is essential see 2 7 Supplier and customer must agree on selection of metrics and performance variables de\002nitions of the metrics and variables as well as target values and on procedures to measure and analyse these values The measured variables should be well-de\002ned straightforward and relevant for customer requirements 8 Selecting such v ariables is challenging since customer requirements are often de\002ned in quite abstract terms 15 Usually se v eral performance variables are used in a PBL contract e.g availability reliability maintainability supportability logistics response time logistic footprint and cost of usage 5 


The variables can be used at different system levels and address different aspects For example reliability can address a component component reliability a system system reliability or system performance mission reliability In the scope of PBL SK 60 the aircraft availability is de\002ned as Saab's ability to provide aircraft on the 003ight-line related to the number of planned missions According to the contract Saab must provide 003ight-ready aircraft at an availability level of at least 95  calculated on an annual basis The availability is de\002ned by Eq 1 below A A=C  P  OP 000 SOP P  1 Where A A=C is the availability of aircraft P are planned 003ight operations by the operator FM OP are unplanned 003ight operations by the operator FM and 002nally SOP is the number of canceled 003ight operations due to Saab AB Planned missions are booked by 002scal year by FM Rescheduled missions are missions that are scrubbed mostly due to bad weather but carried out at a later time but also additional missions booked by the FM Unavailability is de\002ned as missions scrubbed for technical reasons that are within Saab's area of responsibility Eq 1 contains a mechanism by which Saab receives credit for missions that have previously been scrubbed through bad weather but are later 003own without being re-scheduled within the booked missions In such cases the calculated availability can actually exceed 100  Both FMV and Saab consider this to be useful feature since it creates an incentive for the service provider to recover missions lost through bad weather The Armed Forces pay Saab partly by a 002xed monthly sum and partly through a 003ight hour related charge This also creates an incentive to generate missions since the cash 003ow increases when more hours are 003own Price-wise there is no difference between scheduled and unscheduled missions A Flight Operations Plan is established annually de\002ning the total number of planned 003ight hours for the SK 60 system divided on a monthly basis This Flight Operations plan is revised each month jointly by Saab and FM This monthly plan is broken down by week and day and the number of aircraft required is de\002ned by operating site and take-off times Compliance is monitored at individual mission level in order to determine the responsibility for each scrubbed mission If the contracted 95 availability is not complied with Saab is 002ned for non-compliance on a sliding scale between 95  and 90  Each time a mission is scrubbed a form is 002lled in that documents which of the contracting parties that is responsible for the scrub At the end of each month the scrubbed missions are aggregated This analysis is then used to estimate the availability provided according to Eq 1 This relatively simple model has in general proved satisfactory for the type of missions 003own by SK 60 003ight training In cases where a 003ight was carried out but the planned training could not be fully accomplished due to technical problems it is decided on a case-by-case basis whether the mission should be counted as 003own or scrubbed 8 S UMMARY AND D ISCUSSIONS Simulation is an effective method to gain an overview over activities dealing with complex technical systems including their support organization This includes both their current state and possible future scenarios Since PBL business cases are frequently very extensive complex tools are needed to study both system performance and effectiveness of the support solution including maintenance logistics stores management transportation policy etc and associated costs Simulation makes it possible to evaluate and compare alternative operational solutions e g by varying 003eet size turnaround times and stock levels in order to achieve required availability at minimum cost This type of analysis decreases technical and economic risks and ensures a clear understanding of the contractual relation between supplier and customer based on a common view of the enterprise Another important lesson learned from this business case is not to have too complex KPI Key Performance Indicators to measure contract compliance A further conclusion is the paramount importance of good historical operations and maintenance data If such information does not exist is not available to the putative supplier or is unreliable no reliable logistic analyses are possible and any PBL bidding would require very large cost margins to cover technical risks It is also quite important once a PBL Contract has been agreed on to continuously collect operational and maintenance data in order to use the data to avoid potential problems that could otherwise cause lowered availability unforeseen costs etc A CKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to acknowledge
