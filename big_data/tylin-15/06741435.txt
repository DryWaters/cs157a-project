years with services geared towards users through adds-on such as mobile texting Facebook with increasing popularity of Twitter Google and WhatsApp especially in entertainment contexts These social media platforms predominantly consisting of social networking sites SNSs heavily rely on individual users for content creation in contrast to professionallyproduced content SNSs\222 success hinged on constant user involvement and participation W ith forty-one percent of the US population 037nding photos and videos online interestbased content discovery became the driving force for new content generation and redistribution As social media permeates all spheres of our lives and these applications generate considerable percentage of Internet 
traf\037c content streams remain fragmented thus limiting to discover interest-based relevant content to their users We considered interest as an individual experience continuously stimulated by relevant content discovery Single-platform access inevitably leaves a proportion of interest-based content underexposed Single-platform SNSs even historical ones varied technologically and scope-wise ranging from user demographics geographical attributes or mere maintenance of pre-existing relationships Since 2003 specialized social networking sites became mainstream focusing on speci\037c interests such as traveling activism religion photosharing music listening and video sharing to mention a few SNSs evolved and broadened their scope over time For example 
access to Facebook is open to everyone even if initially it was restricted to college student networks Some of these limitations were addressed to overcome limited content access platform interoperability issues and lack of relevant content segmentation across multiple platforms Attempts to facilitate interest-based content access thus started to be modeled within a single platform Some of the techniques included like feature on Facebook Twitter content following and 037ltering were implemented by using hashtags Regardless of these attempts interest-based content still can be searched solely within a single platform rather than across multiple platforms not even considering user interaction with other users or content across through various platforms 
Several social media cross-platform applications pioneered to account for single-platform content access limitations Interest-based content redistribution was facilitated by share function e.g and 5 easier content access to multiple platforms was provided through a open identity to account for increased content variety content aggregation tools we developed to combine functionalities from multiple external sources e.g and 8 In addition for users it tak es time effort and cognitive capacity to follow multiple platforms with equal dedication However all these cross-platform applications continue to bear limitations Although the share function allowed content to be broadcast or duplicated across various platforms the downside of such approach was that the user could engage 
in one-to-many content distribution but remained limited to receive contents from each separated platform individually Open identity f acilitated acces s to content by allo wing users to sign in to multiple websites with a single identity ID Such an open ID remained limited to a targeted platform rather than to multiple parallel platforms Content aggregation platforms in turn provided users with larger amounts of content access yet did not support interaction and content discovery through other user experiences To account for the above mentioned limitations we de191 


that converges multiplatform social media content streams of user interaction on a dozen of popular radio stations This paper is structured as follows First through a concept of Interactivity we explicated theoretical premises of Big Data User-centric model which served as a basis for our application Second we identi\037ed user requirements for content access to account for the user-centric model Third we outlined the architecture of the application and evaluated its implementation Finally we engaged in a discussion regarding conceptual data access issues among media companies user relevance to Big Data context and limited user bene\037ts associated with it II T HEORETICAL PREMISES To account for an enhanced user experience we employed the Big Data User-centric model presented in foregrounded in a Big Data paradigm Big Data paradigm explicates bene\037ts and challenges of increasing quantities of data sources and serves as an analytical and conceptual framework through 037ve parameters The parameters include volume variety velocity veracity and value  1 8  V olume involves large amounts of data that has to be manipulated Variety refers to 037ltering of the uncorrelated and unstructured data sources as well as high scalability of the data Velocity refers to a gained advantage to process large and dynamic amounts of data in a timely manner Veracity quanti\037es the trust associated with inhomogeneous data which is often gathered from unveri\037ed sources The Big Data User-centric model is particularly concerned with value creation for users W e de\037ned v alue as a meaningful information extraction through data analysis going beyond the plurality of its de\037nitions such as the monetary value of something the market price or something intrinsically valuable or desirable Therefore the v alue e xtraction in a Big Data User-centric model for the purposes of this research dealt with interest-based relevance extracted from multiple Fig 1 User roles and experiences in interactive services streams and content navigation and interaction focusing on dimensions of Interactivity de\037ned in the following section A Interactive interest-based environments KASU veloped a uni\037ed access model to interest-based content modeling We capitalized on existing SNSs to create a Big Data repository 226 term used to describe a large and complex collection of growing datasets that is dif\037cult to manage and process using traditional database management tools 226 to model an interest-based content segmentation and content discovery through user interaction The need to maximize social media stream potential was driven by the prosumer culture 226 the current trend in media contexts in which users not only passively consume content but also actively engage with content Users thus became k e y actors in content consumption and production yet posing new challenges to Big Data repositories to create meaningful streams that could be constantly modeled through content discovery and interaction This research was built on theoretical parameters of Interactivity to model and discover interest-based content through user interaction which in multimodal contexts was found somewhat limited 13 14 15 W e proposed a mobile-oriented framework to leverage on mobile devices\222 ubiquity The third generation mobile devices serve not only as communication devices but also provide access to information social media data As a use case of interest-based content access and content discovery through interaction we implemented an android mobile application Departing from the Big Data User-centric model for social media platforms we conceptualized value as a meaningful interest-based content discovery through interaction with other users content and the system Interactivity refers to the quality or condition of interaction Interacti vity conditions consists of non-interactive state when new messages are not related to previous messages reactive when new messages are related only to a speci\037c often times prompted message and interactive when new messages can be related to a number of previous messages having a speci\037c relationship between them Interacti v e interest-based en vironment thus aimed to increase degrees of adaptability user agency choices and 036exibility leading to some of the positive outcomes of Interactivity such as user satisfaction In a speci\037c mass media context so far Interactivity was included through social media outlets Figure 1 exempli\037es how traditional media 226 such as TV radio and newspapers 226 integrated interactive applications through social media to enhance user experience Regardless of the promise of interactivity in traditional media settings it was found to be limited Limits were attributed to structural constraints inherent to a rigid hierarchical architecture limited interaction and control o v er the content Organizations still maintain control over 80 of the content even if half of it is produced by users Ev en if users attempted to maximize content push by repeatedly posting content user role still remains marginal The goal of this study is to provide a conceptual framework to overcome some of the limitations of interactivity described above To enhance interest-based content discovery we drew on seminal research of interactivity 23 24 T o implement our mobile-oriented framework geared towards usercentric experience we utilized the following six dimensions of perceived interactivity proposed by Direction of communication 226 the ability to receive return messages in addition to one-way communication prevalent in traditional mass media such as TV or radio time 036exibility 226 the ways to engage in communication in real time as well as being able to retrieve archival conversations sense of place 226 creation of a common virtual communicative context level of control 226 user agency to select responses in the most appropriate context ability to 192 


1 Subscription management 2 Content management de\037nes a set of features necessary to subscribe or unsubscribe to speci\037c topics and user-related activities Subscription topics are subdivided into two categories topics expressed through well-de\037ned user search rules e.g expression matching which can also employ the use of tags 226 tag subscription and topics emerging from content analysis performed by cloud computing services to discover new interest-aware topics that have good coverage and acceptance We named this type of results as a group of content We created a unique set of functionalities that were geared towards a seamless access to non-interoperable data and an environment to reduce information overload for users to make their reading-data discovery more effective content approximation track messages and identify if they were delivered responsiveness 226 relates to the concept of sequential interrelation between messages where three-message-sequence model was proposed as an ideal one 14 and percei v ed purpose of communication 226 which identi\037es goals of communication and makes interaction meaningful To implement these dimensions we focused on all three proposed interactivity traditions Human-to-human interaction 226 the interaction between users in a mediated environment Human-to-document interaction 226 user interactions with a speci\037c content created by other users and with the creators of the content themselves Human-to-system 226 adaptive system that enables users to get higher levels of control and encompasses the previous two dimensions by combining interface components and human components delivers three essential mechanisms for accessing and managing social media content  aiming at 037nding information pertinent to a given subject through the use of keywords  relying on 037ltering techniques to highlight relevance from a continuous 036ow of information  providing omission techniques to identify relevant items using prede\037ned factors such as the number of recommendations user acceptance and popularity within the community  de\037ning techniques that enable immediate and effortless initiation of interaction  to help users selecting the most important and relevant items by providing users with a brief preview of a given item extracted from each of the properties  introducing techniques to organize the information i.e to highlight its signi\037cance and  combining the aforementioned techniques with actions to postpone and rede\037ne the priority of an item Another Big Data challenge refers to inhomogeneity of cross-platform social media content that comprises not only text but also large quantities of data encapsulated in other formats such as images video and other online user traf\037c data T o manage Big Data st reams we relied on cloud computing as a processing infrastructure and storage framework Cloud computing for our model served as an essential component to handle data-intensive needs required to maintain and promote user interaction over the Internet It de\037nes a new  Its name was inspired by the word\222s dual meaning translated as of the strings or braids and I dig  which entails the thread multiplicity and a persistent search associated with new and relevant interest-based content and users This framework not only facilitates the use and understanding of different sources of information but also locates navigates customizes and interacts with 036exible and 036uid user roles in an interest-based context Moreover it capitalizes on cloud computing as a processing infrastructure which aids users to discover and manage social media content through services that perform analytics at large scale This mobile application accounts for six dimensions of perceived interactivity introduced previously in Section II as well as the following interactivity traditions human-to-human interactivity and human-to-system interactivity rank 037ltering information stack delivers a set of features to manage subscriptions\222 content e.g features to automatically bring to the top the latest and the most relevant items by clearly marking those that have been read Three main components are activity buzz content 037ltering and analytics-oriented content management 193 information 037ltering B Challenges of interactive interest-based content discovery information retrieval delivery model A Human-to-system interaction Interest-based content discovery in a cross-platform context not only enhanced user interaction but it also raised challenges to the Big Data repositories One of challenge\222s was ascribed to a potential cognitive overload The issue of cogniti v e overload in mediated settings was discussed since mid-nineties  26 Ho we v er the increasing amounts of users and their produced content made the issue of cognitive overload even more pronounced It was found that when information supply exceeded individual processing capacity the overload led to stress and to segmented engagement Wilson identi\037ed se v en techniques to ease the infor mation overload associated with interactive Big Data models Building on techniques to tackle information overload brute-force interaction contextualization that embraces a set of existent technologies where all computing and networking resources e.g infrastructures software applications and business processes are delivered as 036exible and scalable services that are sold as on-demand with self-service pay-as-you-go variable cost subscriptions Fig 2 User generated content feed and messenger in a seamless interface III M OBILE ORIENTED FRAMEWORK Considering challenges of Big Data and cross-platform user interaction we developed a mobile-oriented framework entitled KASU KASU 


Content 037ltering Analytics-oriented content management 3 Content interactivity Fig 3 Enhancing interaction using interaction-oriented noti\037cations  Primes all items classi\037ed as important The algorithm used to select relevant items is based on several factors such as the most read items created by opinion makers and user acceptance It also provides a short glance of recent social media content This feature aims to create a sense of community encourage discussing commonly read content and to support serendipity  Through this feature users can de\037ne priority schemes for processing a subset of information while ignoring its complementary set that is to prioritize or exclude content using a set conditional rules Additionally information concerning the usage of this feature is gathered and processed by the analytics-oriented content management module to obtain further insights  For analytical purposes we also implemented a tag cloud per user to create an automatic pro\037le that maps user\222s interests The user pro\037le included additional statistics that were calculated and presented such as activity frequency number of recommendations of items related to a speci\037c topic and information extracted from the platform pro\037le etc Exploring tags\222 statistics page could result in different outcomes users could decide removing a tag that was apparently not followed by a signi\037cant number of users or adopt a tag that was highly used by others alternatively users could decide to change their reading habits after discovering that an important tag had diverged interpretations by the community Activity buzz KASU B Human-to-human interaction C Cloud computing as a Big Data analytics solution KASU Apart from the spatial navigation which is intrinsically associated with the features described in the previous section the application also introduced novel mechanisms to foster temporal dimension i.e real-time interaction across various platforms On one hand it focused on a noti\037cation system\222s ability to provide invitation opportunities to novice users to engage in a sustained interaction with and through the interface It also served to inform experienced users 226 in realtime 226 about ongoing activities that might be of interest see Figure 3 Noti\037cation interaction alerted users about the latest updates yet did not require them to take an immediate action freeing users from the constant urge to pay attention to content streams Fig 4 Mobile-oriented Service Architecture We designed content noti\037cations to be personalized with speci\037c sounds to identify the source and type of interaction without even unlocking the mobile device Additionally the noti\037cation system capitalized on a one-click interface to give users the possibility to promptly engage with other users and groups postpone the interaction 226 to give users the possibility to place information on hold as suggested by and to foster relevance as a cornerstone aspect of a given community Through rating mechanisms users indirectly inform other users about the relevance of a certain item to ensure coverage of important issues Although required a backbone architecture to continuously extract social media content from Big Data repositories and to handle all the management and processing tasks to overcome mobile devices\222 bandwidth and processing limitations Our mobile-oriented framework 226 based on a concept of cloud computing and built on top of a Hadoop framework presented in detail in 226 w as strate gically designed to provide support to mobile devices in data-intensive operations see Figure 4 First it handled the access and extraction of data from inhomogeneous data sources SNSs Second it was responsible for processing the acquired data into a uni\037ed data model that was ready to be consumed by mobile devices Lastly it was in charge of loading the social media content into the analytics pipeline and served mobile devices with features for data analytics The Big Data analytics process was responsible for computing the relevance of all social media content according to a small list of parameters to ensure that users did not miss relevant items Some of the parameters used were the number 194 provided multiple opportunities to prioritize and 037lter information through content analysis such techniques remain insuf\037cient to overcome information overload On one hand the quality and quantity of results depends on how users con\037gure their systems For example the use of erroneous content 037lters greatly contributes to the unsatisfactory user experience and low content quality On the other hand extracting and analyzing all the social media content is unfeasible not only because of mobile devices\222 low processing capabilities 226 that would lead to incomplete outputs or irresponsiveness 226 but also because of the unrealistic amount of network connections required to access necessary data Moreover restricted number of requests permitted within a certain time window by data providers 226 mainly social networking sites 226 introduces even greater complexity Hence Several mechanisms were implemented to provide higher levels of user-content interactivity From the main screen users can access all the content 226 i.e user pro\037les and thread messages with a one-click mechanism They can reply and/or identify the source medium destination and message see Figure 2 


we analyzed the top ten radios from the Top Facebook Radio Pages list The sample of radios analyzed included RTL 102.5 Mosaique FM Radio Sawa Alwakeelnews Jawhara FM HIT Radio Mazaj FM Play 99.6 Virgin Dubai and Hala FM Radio Social media platforms consisted of Facebook Twitter and Google Table I breaks down the distribution of 12,312 messages produced during a period of one week by social media platforms i.e users and radios TABLE I U SER ACTIVITY ON TOP RADIOS 222 SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS Facebook Google Twitter msgs users msgs users msgs users RTL 102.5 2363 1887 1 1 239 58 Mosaique FM

Virgin Radio Dubai 466 395 62 30 127 5 Hala FM Radio 4369 137 0 1 126 1 Table I shows that majority of content traf\037c on these radios were generated by Facebook users given that we have selected the top radios based on Facebook To account for user engagement through interactivity with radios we studied how radios used interactive question prompts to stimulate user responses in the process of content creation RTL 102.5 HIT Radio and Virgin Radio Dubai stimulated their users the most respectively 13 11 and 7 question prompts on Facebook followed by RTL 102.5 with 3 prompts on Twitter The frequency of prompts differed across the radios and the platforms as did the number of user messages RTL 102.5 users generated more content on Facebook than on Twitter Nevertheless it remains an empirical question to what degree these prompts would in\036uence content generation Given the initially diverse technological structure and social practices of social media platforms that we analyzed it may lead to unattended consequences of social shaping regarding content modeling and discovery It is also worth mentioning that our test sample purposefully connected a very limited set of radios Our sample could be easily scaled to larger numbers Also this application could be adapted to any context that goes beyond radio or entertainment media presented via this use-case Additionally the quantity and quality of data being exchanged through this framework depends on the actors involved Nevertheless the quantity of messages being exchanged was suf\037cient to understand the interactivity in a Big Data context and to test the techniques to address it V C ONCLUSION In this paper we proposed a model that encompassed the interconnectedness between services and social media platforms We considered Big Data as ways to highlight user value and bridge user needs through social media and professional content by enabling users to model interest-based relevant streams and create their own individualized social radio experience In practical terms we developed a mobileoriented framework built on top of social media streams and professional radio content This android application aimed to facilitate user immersion and an interactive experience through non-hierarchical customization and enhanced individual choice in a continuously dynamic unstructured content environment Due to bandwidth and mobile processing limitations we also developed a service architecture based on the concept of cloud computing Cloud computing served as an essential element to ensure the access and processing of inhomogeneous data SNSs Our approach extended previous implementations of usercentric services of Big Data that were predominantly geared to strengthen internal services through multiplatform content access and 036uid content sharing This study is based on the interest-based architecture that leads to access professional and social media content streams posted to the radios Our adaptive Big Data User-centric model capitalized on a 036exible environment sensitive to changing data 036uxes between services provided by radio stations and social networking sites The value proposed here focused on user enhanced experience with radio content 195 of user recommendations tags coverage user engagement and relevance to user interests etc The relevance and coverage of a tag was calculated by measuring the number of items read out of the total items posted Hence our goal is that results would be automatically shaped by community\222s interaction Finally this process is also responsible for regulation of the maximum amount of noti\037cations received by users I V U SE CASE  A SEAMLESS RADIO CONTEXT Entertainment radios represent a large set of real-time changing data streams that include professionally-produced content such as music news and talk shows that are further shaped by user-generated social media streams through Facebook Twitter and Google to name a few Prevalence of multiple data streams made radio stations a good candidate for Big Data Variety of Big Data streams 226 that is diverse social media platforms provided new opportunities for interest-based community formation Finally this cross-platform recon\037guration impacted value as well in terms of the emergence of new interactive contexts In traditional mass media users are constrained to access radio content through the hierarchical architecture that is based on one-to-many model which focuses on an individual radio\222s content In contrast to the hierarchical one-radio access architecture we propose a user-centric architecture that departs from the interest-based content rather than a speci\037c radio This model is geared to enable a 036uid content access of various radio stations and contents associated with it to foster content discovery and content management Access to speci\037c radio programs can be exempli\037ed by the following scheme radio-programs/DJ-songs/artists/albums In addition to music content the primary radio stations\222 content users could access radio stations\222 social media content streams as well Finally all radio stations\222 contents would generate a uni\037ed Big Data repository form which individually tailored interests could be extracted To run initial tests on a cross-radio Big Data repository with the developed application KASU
