Abstract 
computer networking curriculum in order to prepare the students with market opportunities and challenges after graduating The Computer Networks and  or data communications course or the whole knowledge area of networking and communication in general are supposed to be a core part of computer science and net centric computing Given the fact that these students prefer to learn software oriented courses the Universities have to make the course more interesting and sophisticated enough to follow today\220s trends In this paper we present a new adaptive curriculum for the Computer Networks course The students have the opportunity to choose between a practically or theoretically oriented course Our intention is to make the most of the learning objectives 
Cisco 
Education 
in the course more practical and thus initiate increased interest of the students However the core part of theoretical lectures about low level reliable data communication is obligatory for both approaches 
I I NTRODUCTION Computer networks and data communication are usually a part of a Net-Centric Computing which mainly includes traditional networking web development and network security However networks are a key part of today\220s and tomorrow\220s

computing environment such as complex data centers grid or cloud computing Therefore ACM/IEEE-CS renamed and refactored its previous knowledge area into the new Networking and Communication which is a part of Systems Fundamentals 2 Computer science students usually want to attend software oriented courses that is programming languages and algorithms rather than hardware oriented courses such as Computer Architecture and Organization or Computer Networks and Data Communications They usually want to use the computers or network devices without knowing how they work Teachers must spend a lot of effort in order not to lose the students\220 attention and willingness to learn the latter courses after the 223rst or second week Therefore the Computer 
Networks course curriculum should follow the new trends in computer networks and introduce more practice in order to awake the students\220 curiosity during the semester In this paper we present a new curriculum for the Computer Network course for computer science students It is an adaptive curriculum which introduces two CISCO CCNA Cisco Certi\223ed Network Associate 1 and 2 courses instead of the existing regular tutorials and laboratory exercises This new curriculum offers more options to all types of students that is whether the students would like to learn the course with more practice or more theoretically We also present a detailed grading scheme together with implementing online learning and e-assessment environment for theoretical lectures 
which are still obligatory for all students The rest of the paper is organized as follows Related work is presented in Section II for different methodologies of computer network course\220s curriculum Section III presents the Computer Networks course\220s organization grading and obstacles In Section IV we discuss the changes of the course by introducing CISCO CCNA program in the curriculum and new grading scheme We evaluate our practical approach in Section V and discuss the CISCO CCNA integration in the computer network course curriculum in Section VI Finally Section VII is devoted to conclusion and future work II R ELATED WORK The Computer Networks course is one of the core courses 
in computer science and computer engineering curricula We have found many authors that introduced many innovations in the course in order to improve the teaching and learning processes Most of them are focused on introducing practical exercises in the laboratory regardless of whether it is with physical equipment or virtual The emergence of new techniques and technologies allows the education to alleviate the process of teaching and learning Anisetti et al sho w ho w para virtual laboratory can be used to setup virtual networking labs which usually improves the students\220 performance compared with the case when the students are working directly on physical networking equipment Hernandez-Leo et al introduced tw o tools Collage 6

Open Educational Resources resources such as blogs OCWs OpenCourseWare and video logs Bastidas proposed the extension of the learning by implementing the computer networking laboratory infrastructure to distance students VNUML-UM Virtualization Tool can be used for the practical teaching of mobility load balancing and high availability NVLab is another tool that uses virtualization which is a web-based laboratory and offers the students tools to draw con\223gure test and troubleshoot network designs Several authors proposed new methodologies for the Computer Networks course For example Regueras et al proposed educational methodology based on collaborative and competitive learning That is part of the students collaborate in order to de\223ne the questions while the others compete among each other in order to be the 223rst to give a correct answer However we have not found an appropriate proposal for practical approach for teaching computer networks and changes in the course curriculum In this paper we introduce practical approach for teaching computer networks by implementing CISCO Networking Academy into the course as well as the methodology how to integrate with the other parts of the course III T HE COMPUTER NETWORK COURSE This section presents the existing curriculum for the Computer Networks course which is supposed to be organized with 2 hours of theoretical lectures 2 hours theoretical exercises and 2 hours laboratory exercises per week to be prepared for the exams Four e-Tests e-assessments are conducted using an e-Testing system 14 each follo wed by a three weeks period for the material of theoretical lectures Each e-Test consists of 10-12 questions mostly delivered as multiple choice answers which cover the particular learning objectives Theoretical exams are also performed by using the eAssessment system in order to have evenly grading since there are more than 750 students enrolled in the course and four different teachers It usually consists of average 50 questions mostly delivered as multiple choice answers which cover all course learning objectives Each student also needs to develop a project related to the topics covered in tutorials and laboratory assignments during the semester Tutorial exams are usually with tasks mostly delivered as real life problems of computer network and data communications Exams 75 Projects 20 Activity 5 TABLE II A NALYTIC REGULAR GRADING SCHEME Theoretical exam 140 50 4 e-Tests eAssessments 60 Tutorial exam 60 50 Laboratory Exercises 30 50 Project 10 50 Percentage Points Minimum to pass Total 300 Activity Activity The distribution of the points that the students can achieve is presented in Table I Since the course is lectured and organized in several parts we de\223ned the way how the possible points can be achieved by the students as presented in more details in Table II Let us explain each activity and grading The students must participate in several activities until the end of the semester in order to learn the planned objectives and TABLE I S TRATEGIC GRADING SCHEME By comparing the points in Table II we can conclude that 200 points 67 of e-Tests and theoretical exams are achieved by the learning objectives covered by the theoretical lectures 60 points 20 by the tutorials mostly through theoretical exams and 40 points 13 by the practical part i.e the laboratory exercises and the project After conducting in-depth analysis of the course in a period of more than 10 years we detected that most of the problems for the students are the 216smallest\216 parts that is the laboratory and tutorials which offer the students with maximum 33 The analysis show that this happens because the students are more focused on learning the objectives presented on the theoretical lectures rather than other parts of the curriculum because they can achieve enough points to pass the exam only by learning the theoretical part The other two parts were usually learned only by the best students who wanted to achieve higher grades Trying to enforce the students to achieve minimum points in the other two parts did not produce good results As a consequence the students were revolted because they had to learn a lot to pass the part which offered a small amount of points Therefore we tried another approach to upgrade and improve the curriculum by introducing some more interesting 978-1-4799-3190-3/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 3-5 April 2014, Military Museum and Cultural Center, Harbiye, Istanbul, \Turkey 2014 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference \(EDUCON Page 500 A About the course B The course grading C Course obstacles Usually the Computer Network course is organized in three parts theoretical lectures exercises and lab assignments Several approaches exist in teaching the course such as the top-down or bottom-up approaches The former assumes that the teaching of the course starts with the upper layers of the main protocol stack for example application layer and then continues to the lower layers for example physical media and signal transport covering learning objectives from the applications to the reliable delivery routing forwarding data link and physical medium data communication The latter assumes that the students start with the lower layers and continue to the upper layers i.e they build the understanding of the network transport and 223nally the application layer We prefer a bottom up approach since the protocols of the application and transport layers HTTP FTP DNS DHCP etc together with their TCP  UDP ports are covered in a preceding course Internet programming 


This upgrade is based on student attendance on the CCNA1 and 2 courses instead of regular theoretical and laboratory exercises The teachers are certi\223ed CISCO instructors quali\223ed to provide a good presentation and assessment of students skills and knowledge The Cisco CCNA1 course covers the network fundamentals teaching the students about the layered concept of the network protocols VLSM Ethernet and other L1 and L2 protocols while CCNA2 covers various routing L3 protocols Both courses extend the student learning outcomes on behalf of the theoretical part which is still covered well with theoretical lectures Another very important bene\223t for the students are the possibilities for obtaining the certi\223cates and to get into even more advanced knowledge on computer networks by attending the other CCNA 3 and CCNA4 courses also offered by the faculty\220s academy The new grading scheme is presented in Table III Both the theoretical exam and e-Tests kept the grading scheme because that material remained the same as the previous However the theoretical exercises are migrated from the theory into the practice that is the last three parts of the course are removed and CISCO CCNA1 and CCNA2 courses are integrated into the curriculum But the grading for the practical CISCO exercises are not a total of 100 points but 110 One might think that this new grading scheme will lower the pass criterion compared to the regular grading scheme but we argue that the students that follow the course with the CISCO curriculum have to learn additional learning objectives for example the same routing protocols with more implementation details additional routing protocols etc and also have additional exams It means that CISCO CCNA courses can be passed by practical and theoretical exams total of 4 exams while in the same time the regular students should take only one theoretical exam Let\220s analyze how the 100 points from the regular curriculum are achieved Assigning the points to midterms in the 223rst half of the semester a student can achieve 30 points for the theoretical exam 15 points for laboratory exercises and 5 points for the project These points and material should be equal with those achieved by the CISCO CCNA1 On the other hand CISCO CCNA1 and CCNA2 consists of these 223ve parts In this section we elaborate the proposed curriculum for the theoretical exercises which are lectured with two lessons weekly Table IV brie\224y presents the material covered with the theoretical exercises scheduled by weeks Usually two CISCO

assessments Modules according to CISCO Homework assignments Laboratory exercises e-Assessment exam Final exam according to CISCO Practical exam Skills according to CISCO and practical topics such as those covered by the CCNA courses from the CISCO Certi\223ed Networking Academy We believed that these changes would provoke the students to learn the computer networks in more details as well as to be prepared for practical assignments required by the market The companies prefer certi\223ed employees prior to employment rather than spending money and time on their training and certi\223cation during the employment IV T HE NEW CURRICULUM Theoretical lectures and e-Tests were not changed with this improvement since there were no problems identi\223ed with them but we upgraded and changed the other two parts The students have the opportunity to choose a program CISCO or regular they want to enroll in order to learn the theoretical and laboratory exercises 40 Final exam 40 Skills and 20 Modules Additionally the CISCO students must pass both the 223nal exam and skills with a minimum of 70 rather than 50 for the regular students which also makes the CISCO course harder to pass laboratory exercises where the students work on equipment and CISCO\220s proposed simulators which corresponds to the regular laboratory exercises but now according to CISCO CCNA program TABLE III A NALYTIC CISCO GRADING SCHEME Minimum to pass Theoretical exam 140 50 4 e-Tests eAssessments 60 CCNA 1 55 70 Final exam and Skills CCNA 2 55 70 Final exam and Skills A Cisco courses B The new grading scheme C New course practical approach for theoretical exercises CISCO program Points Total 310 that corresponds to the theoretical 223nal exam for regular curriculum and Activity which partially corresponds to the project for regular curriculum We can observe that the CISCO\220s students have two additional tasks and one additional exam Therefore additional 5 points are added to each CCNA course Next we explain the distribution of the 55 points of each CISCO course 100 of CISCO points are normalized in 50 points plus 5 points are bonus for those students that are active in the laboratory work on the CISCO equipment and 223nished the homework asignemnts on time The 50 points are distributed as each is assessed in a one hour period and the students are usually assessed at home working some challenge exercises by CISCO tutorials or special made by our CISCO instructors adapted as the student\220s knowledge although our students have a good ICT background But these homework assignments are allowed only for active and present students on the laboratory exercises 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 


There are 12 CISCO laboratory exercises that cover the practical part of CCNA 1 and CCNA 2 courses i.e by six laboratory exercises for each course Each laboratory exercise is explained in detail below This is the 223rst exercise of the CCNA 2 course which consists of setting up a static routing between 2-3 routers in a basic network topology For homework students have a task to con\223gure a more complex exercise which requires a con\223guration of a static routing among 4-5 routers in a speci\223c network topology The students learn the concepts of Source and Destination IP addresses CCNA modules are lectured each week However an exception is made with the introduction modules of both CCNA 1 and CCNA2 which are lectured three hours in a week since that material is covered in theoretical lectures On the other hand several modules are lectured only one in a week such as VLSM Variable Length Subnet Mask CLI Command Line Interface Routing table and EIGRP since they are the most important practical parts and more attention should be given TABLE IV CISCO EXERCISES BY WEEKS 1 Application Layers CCNA1 Modules 1 2 and 3 2 Transport and Network Layers Segment  Packet Analysis

applications and their related services like HTTP DNS DHCP Telnet and others This is an introduction laboratory exercise and the students do not have any trouble with it since they have already met these protocols in previous courses The students learn how to troubleshoot by using the PING TELNET and Traceroute commands For homework the students should analyze and give an example with some application services by their own desire D New course laboratory exercises CISCO program Theme CISCO CCNA Module Midterm 1 CCNA1 Practical Skills and Final Exam Midterm 2 CCNA2 Practical Skills Final

the students to analyze the network communication by speci\223c network protocol in their home networks In this laboratory exercise the students learn the different PDU\220s Protocol Data Unit headers in each layer 2 3 and 4 After learning the subnetting the next exercise consists of con\223guring a medium-sized network topology by subnetting the 8-9 tricky random networks using VLSM A challenge exercises developed by CISCO is given for homework as a preparation for the practical exam i.e for the midterm 1 Week CCNA1 Modules 7 and 8 Now we are moving in the lower network layer By using the CISCO Packet Tracer simulator the students should set up a basic netw ork topology and make the most basic functions like turn on/off the network devices interfaces on the network devices and work with the offered network cables The most important learning objective is to learn the hierarchy of IP addresses and the usage of subnet masks For homework students should make a basic network topology with only one router by their own desire interconnect it with appropriate network cables addressed it and check the network connectivity This laboratory exercise consists of designing and con\223guring a small network topology on a physical CISCO equipment by using the RIPv1 routing protocol The students should analyze the advantages and disadvantages from the dynamic routing protocols in real life scenario For homework the students should design and con\223gure a speci\223c network topology with RIPv1 in order to prove the RIPv1 de\223ciencies classful routing protocol de\223ciencies It is time to learn the subnetting i.e the students should subnet several networks from some IP address range with the same subnet mask and con\223gure an appropriate network topology with them For homework students should subnet more complex network and con\223gure an appropriate network topology with them After the students learn practically about the de\223ciencies of the classful routing protocols they learn about the classless routing protocol The laboratory 978-1-4799-3190-3/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 3-5 April 2014, Military Museum and Cultural Center, Harbiye, Istanbul,

Another view of grade distribution that is the average grades for each year is depicted in Figure 5 The results of the evaluation show that CISCO students achieved slightly better grades than regular students especially in the prior years when their number was greater We can conclude that although the CISCO students are allowed to achieve 10 more points the average grade distribution of all years is very similar for both student groups which proves our curriculum Several arguments also con\223rm this conlcusion The CISCO students actually have more topics to cover an extra exam than regular students They are more motivated due to practical challenges and also they are enforced to learn more since they spend money and do not want just to pass the course but gain more knowledge through practical exercises VI D ISCUSSION Tanenbaum and Stallings 19 propose a bottom-up approach for teaching and learning about the computer networks These books are also proposed to our students even more because they are of\223cially translated to the student\220s native language The other approach is the top-down approach which is proposed by Kurose The teachers usually choose the approach they prefer In this paper we presented the integration of these two opposite approaches simultaneously That is CISCO\220s CCNA 1 and 2 approach is top-down and it was a very hard to integrate with the theoretical bottom-up approach The results of the course with the new curriculum as well as with the regular one during several years con\223rm our success Implementation of two CISCO CCNA courses improved the course\220s average throughput of CISCO students spectacularly that is average 91.09 CISCO students passed the course compared to minor 37.84 of the regular students The CISCO students are more motivated because they work with practical equipment they face real problems and 223nally they can continue with CCNA 3 and CCNA4 extend their knowledge achieve a 223nal certi\223cate and 223nd a job more easily The similar grade distribution and the average grade through several years is expected since 200 points two thirds of the points are still from the theoretical part of the course which is obligatory for both approaches for the Computer Networks curricula VII C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Computer science students usually avoid to learn the nonsoftware courses such as the Computer Networks and Data Communications although most of the applications in today\220s broadband world are distributed and acquire the services by the lower network protocols This paper proposes a new computer network curriculum by introducing CISCO CCNA 1 and CCNA 2 courses into the course This change allows the students to choose if they would like to follow the course according to more practical exercises and tutorials instead of the regular which are more theoretical The course evaluation in the period of several years show that these changes improved the course throughput without making the course easier that is the grade distribution of passed students is slightly better for CISCO students The analysis also show that although the Computer Networks course is one of the core courses it should be offered in the upper study years after the students have learned more details about Internet well known application protocols and distributed systems We have concluded the following students obtain better results by learning more practical oriented courses and moving the computer network class in the second study year instead of the third year of study gives worse results When the course is moved to the 223rst or second study year less students understand the importance of practical approach and recognize it as opportunity to get in touch with engineering 978-1-4799-3190-3/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 3-5 April 2014, Military Museum and Cultural Center, Harbiye, Istanbul, \Turkey 2014 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference \(EDUCON Page 505 Fig 4 The grade distribution of CISCO and regular students Fig 5 The average grade distribution through years D The average grade

the point displacement A good introduction to the possible techniques can be found in Warping Processor 226 WRP The warping Processor receives as input a number of bands of the slave image the af\002ne transformation and the X and Y offset parameters computed by the Interpolation Processor and produces as output the warped bands according to the offsets Since offsets generally contain a decimal part various methods of interpolation of data can be used to get the 002nal result The easiest way is to round the offset to a whole number and take the exact value of the resulting pixel as the destination This technique is called nearest neighborhood it is simple to implement but can cause artifacts in the output image especially when very thin features are present Interpolation of the source pixels gives better results many approaches are possible but the most common are bi-linear and bi-cubic interpolations which are both provided However the perfect interpolator would be an in\002nitely long 2dimensional sinc 002lter which is unfortunately not feasible so a windowed version called the Lanczos 002lter is used instead The GPU texture memory already provides hardware assist for bi-linear interpolation In fact accessing the memory using 003oating point coordinates yelds a value which is the weighted average of the four closest pixels with a single memory fetch Performance are identical to using whole numbers and indeed our implementation does not actually distinguish between the two as the nearest neighborhood relies on the bi-linear function by simply rounding the pixel location To further increase performance the destination image is divided in blocks and a kernel operating in parallel on all pixels of a block has been developed A similar kernel was also developed for complex images using two fetches 050the real and the imaginary parts\051 rather than a single one as in the normal case Bi-cubic interpolation is even better than bi-linear as it uses a weighted average of the 16 closest pixels to determine a pixel value so it produces a smoother result However there is no dedicated hardware support in the GPU Fortunately instead of 16 memory fetches a bi-cubic interpolation mechanism can be achieved using just 4 bi-linear lookups by offsetting the sample position within each pixel and weighting the samples correctly as described in This technique has been again implemented for both real valued and complex images by using an appropriate kernel to process a block of pixels of the output warped band concurrently The Lanczos 002lter implementation is based on a windowed version of a sinc 002lter according to the following formulation 050in one dimension\051 L 050 x 051  032 sinc\050 031x 051 sinc\050 031x=a 051 if 000 a  x  a 0 otherwise where a is a positive integer and it is an input parameter of the tool 050typical values are between 2 and 5\051 The two dimensional version is simply the product of two one dimensional 002lters along the orthogonal axes i.e L 050 x y 051  L 050 x 051 001 L 050 y 051  where we assume that a is used for both the horizontal and vertical functions In the implementation the value a de\002nes a square region of size 2 a  centered on the location in the slave image de\002ned by the X and Y offsets and the af\002ne transformation if the af\002ne transformation includes a rotation the square is also rotated A kernel has been developed to evaluate the 002lter within the square region using integer coordinates for the source pixels and applying the proper coef\002cient given by the above expression All contributions are then summed to obtain the 002nal value for the warped image pixels As the Lanczos coef\002cients are already normalized no further adjustment is needed after accumulation Since offsets are in general 003oating point numbers the Lanczos 002lter has to be potentially evaluated for any value between 000 a and a  However to improve performance the horizontal and vertical 002lters coef\002cients are pre-computed with 1024 samples between any whole value This shall be compared to the expected precision of the estimated sub-pixel displacement which is no more than 1/30 of a pixel and therefore it is considered more than adequate To further increase the throughput the developed kernel performs the evaluation of the 002lter for many pixels in parallel Unfortunately given that each pixel has a different offset it is not possible to share contributions between adjacent pixels in the warped image so a separate thread is run for each of them In case the warping function is a rigid translation then the 002lter can in principle be separated into an horizontal and vertical one thus achieving a huge saving in running time However given that the transformation is almost never so simple this optimization has not been implemented 6 E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS The co-registration toolchain has been applied to many reallife satellite images from both optical and SAR sensors In this section two examples are presented to verify it against two main metrics accuracy and timing performance In both cases we relied on synthetically generated slave images in order to be able to correctly verify the obtained results In a 002rst experiment a sample high resolution 050 14320 002 11760  168 Mpixels\051 3-bands optical image is used as the master On the other hand the slave image is derived from the master with a known distortion applied The distortion is a third order polynomial with 006 9 pixels in the horizontal direction and 006 3 pixels in the vertical one An equally spaced grid of 100 002 100 pixels has been de\002ned where each master patch is 64 002 64 pixels and the search area size in the slave is 128 002 128  The matching processor is run using the sub-pixel option with accuracy of 1/100 of a pixel and the interpolation processor is used with three different algorithms Linear Triangulation 050LT\051 Quintic Triangulation 050QT\051 and Least Square Polynomial 050LSP\051 with degree 3 Table 1 gives the RMS error in pixels in both the horizontal and vertical directions for all cases As it can be seen the error is always very low and LSP is the most accurate with the QT being better than LT as expected Figure 5 shows the generated horizontal offsets by the LSP in the graph for each pixel of the image a bright value represents a positive x offset 050with white representing the maximum positive offset\051 and a dark one a negative offset 050with black the maximum negative\051 Co-registration timing performance are veri\002ed on two sets of images in the 002rst one images are 20000 002 20000 050400 Mpixels\051 with two bands while in the second they are smaller at 8000 002 8000 05064 Mpixels\051 but with 12 bands each 9
