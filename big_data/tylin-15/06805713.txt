Ludena R Department of Computer and Information Sciences Sojo University Kumamoto, JAPAN dennis@cis.sojo-u.ac.jp Abstract 227 The new paradigm of Big Data and its multiple benefits have being used in the novel nutrition-based vegetable production and distribution system in order to generate a healthy food recommendation to the end user and to provide different analytics to improve the system efficiency. As next step in this study, the new paradigm Internet of Things \(IoT\cluded in the Big Data approach of the system to use its benefits particularly automation, to add much more precise data to the system to provide to the user a much richer experience. The IoT paradigm is bridging the real world with its virtual image, where devices located in different areas could exchange information each other without any type of supervision or control. But, spite of all the benefits that IoT could bring to society, the security of the information as well as privacy must be strongly enforced and managed in this new environment with unique characteristics. In our project we make a particular approach and security assessment of the use of IoT to provide automatic data to the system Index Terms 227Big Data, Computer Science, Data systems, IoT Data Analysis I  I NTRODUCTION Although there is no a common agreement regarding the IoT definition, we could express it as the seamlessly integration of internet-based sensors and devices in a wide network area that interact with a much more advanced Personal Area Network, allowing us to recognize, in a much more richer and detail manner, the environment surrounding us and interchanging information with this environment in an automatic manner. The impact of the research outcome will be strong from the user point of view, due that the different potential applications like: domotics, health, agriculture intelligent services, etc IoT research is still in its infancy but since its beginnings it represents a challenging research scenario due to many issues from the technical area \(wireless communications\ to a much more philosophical one about applicable law and ethics Different organizations around the world have released efforts towards the standardization of IoT, Table 1 shows some of them together with some of its characteristics, some being more successful than other but in the wide spectrum, there is no general consensus towards a one single IoT approach [31 II S ECURITY IN I O T As IoT is in its infancy, the same happens with the issue of securing the exchanged information in the wireless networks that represent the core concept of IoT. In Table 1 we observed several approaches made by different worldwide organizations towards the development of a standards to be used under the unique characteristics that represents the wireless networks in IoT. But standardization could not include securing the exchanged information. IoT, because of its wireless nature, is extremely vulnerable to different attacks, specially eavesdropping in addition to the physical security issue, due that some devices could be most of the time unattended after installation For the objectives of our project is necessary to secure the exchanged information in order to ensure users will not resist to use our system, moreover to accept and use the automation and constant automatic updates provided by the IoT environment III P ROJECT D ESCRIPTION The Novel nutrition-based vegetable production and distribution system is a project being developed under the found of New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization \(NEDO\ in Japan, that is the Governmental Organization in charge of the promotion of addressing energy and global environmental problems, and the enhancement of Japan\222s Industrial competitiveness, through research and development, not only in Japanese territory but also abroad  T h e pr oj ec t i s b a s e d o n  t h e  fo l l o w i ng obj ec t i v e s   200 To provide a healthy suggestion to the user 200 To use local vegetables producers food inventory as reference for the suggestion system 200 To help local vegetable producers to locate their products in a more efficient manner 200 The healthy suggestion provided to the user will be based on: fresh vegetables or a meal prepared using these vegetables by a local restaurant 200 To deliver the suggestion \(fresh vegetables or meal\ to the end user through a local transportation company 2014 IEEE 10th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & its Appli\cations \(CSPA2014 978-1-4799-3091-3/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 20

Using current technologies these requirements could be achievable but further analysis and research is required in the area of IoT security in order to provide a solid approach towards a secure information exchange V  P OSSIBLE THREATS AGAINST I O T For the specific purposes or the project we focus on the security analysis on two main aspects: authentication and data integrity Authentication and data integrity are two of the major problems related to IoT. Authentication is difficult in IoT due to its infrastructure requirements and servers that perform the authentication process through the information exchange with other nodes. In an IoT environment this could result not practical due to that RFID tags cannot exchange too many messages with the authentication servers because their issues related to energy management and messages standardization this issue applies as well to sensor networks. Energy issues are one of the most difficult to overcome in RFID networks as well as sensor networks, due that there are scattered over a wide area and sometimes unmonitored, energy management is a key factor in order to ensure a long device life as well as usability In the same manner, some authentication protocols could not be used due to their lack of standardization In this context, several approaches were developed for sensor networks [78 reference pape  I n t h e s e ca se s ga t e w a y s  that are part of the sensor networks are required to provide connection to the Internet. In the IoT scenario sensor nodes must be seen as nodes in the Internet, therefore authentication is required in order to differentiate them from sensors in the same area but not belonging to the same network In the case of RFID several approaches were presented, but most of them have serious issues, some of them mentioned in   The \223Man in the middle\224 attack is considered one of the biggest threats against wireless networks as well to IoT networks. Data integrity solutions should guarantee that the data in transaction cannot be modified and the system must be able to detect this situation. Data integrity as a issue has been extensively studied for standard network applications and communication systems and early results are related to sensor networks [29  B u t  w h en a RFID n e tw o r k s w ith th ei r o w n  unique characteristics are included in the current internet paradigm, different problems arise as well as unforeseen problems related to their use. Several approaches are developed or under research to solve the different new RFID related issues i.e. EPCGlobal Class-1 Generastion-2 and ISO/IEC 18000-3, both of them working in different process to protect the device memory. These approaches also consume large amount of the resources in encryption processes needed. The main used resources are: energy and bandwidth, both of them in the destination. Therefore, even using these approaches specific related problems with RFID still remain VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  Farmers have been facing some difficulties regarding their business because of weather change, price instability and constant financial problems due to foreign competition Therefore, an expensive service like this could be only available to big producers in which case, markets are completely ensured long time contracts Academic and Company based research initiatives haven shown different issues that jeopardized their continuity which affects directly to the farmer. Being the biggest issue in academic research: budget and availability of multidisciplinary human resources needed for the correct project development and in the case of company based research, their cost, which could not be affordable by the farmer The current participation of specialized members for each of the tasks related to the project increases its competitive 2014 IEEE 10th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & its Appli\cations \(CSPA2014 22 


advantage without creating any issue to farmers the moment they will use the system Big Data analytics allowed us to have a better understanding of the user needs and requirements regarding the project objectives The new IoT parading is becoming a part of the current and future Internet. The current internet paradigm will drastically change into a much more personalized experienced with our surroundings that will lead to much more richer experience In the case of applications, is necessary to make a deep analysis of the requirements needed to be implemented, in order to specifically use what could result much more beneficial for a specific project purpose In the case of our project, IoT could bring not only automatic updates regarding key issues of the project, but allow us to drastically improve the user experience through different new services IoT Security as a new paradigm and new potentially useful research area must address its security concerns in order to show a more reliable platform for the user that, currently, could resist a functional initiative. Due that a single security incident could damage permanently the infinite benefits IoT could bring to the society A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was supported by New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization \(NEDO\ in \223IT Integration-based New Social System Development and Demonstration Projects\224, Grant No. 12102069 R EFERENCES  1  Dennis A.

Intuitively delta compression should slow down the data-restore performance of a data-reduction system since it needs to restore the resembling chunks by two reads one for the delta data and the other for the base-chunk and then delta decode them But in our evaluation of the restore operations for resembling chunks we nd that the speed of delta decode i.e Xdelta  8  tends to be v ery f ast about 1GB/s in the DARE system Another interesting observation is that for a restoration cache of a given size with a delta chunk and its based chunk  DARE actually caches more logical content of the two chunks and than a deduplication-only system and thus improves the datarestore performance by virtual of the enlarged restoration cache due to delta compression Figures 7\(a and 8\(a show that DARE on average doubles the data-restore speed of the deduplication-only system both running on the RAID Figures 7\(b and 8\(b clearly show that the reason lies in the fact that DARE reads half as many containers for restoration as the deduplicationonly system The superior data-restore performance of SF-2F and SF-4F to the deduplicationonly system is attributed to their data reduction efciency see Tables 3 and 4  Since the restoreperformance for the other six datasets is similar to and consistent with that of the Less dataset they are omitted to save space The sudden increase in the data-restore performance of the deduplicationonly approach at the backup version 17 Figure 8\(a we observe is due to the fact that most of the backed-up sources targeted for restoration are from the current and recent backups and thus have fewer random reads for restoration

In this paper we present DARE a deduplication-aware low-overhead resemblance detection and elimination scheme for delta compression on the top of deduplication on backup datasets DARE uses a novel resemblance detection approach DupAdj which exploits the duplicate-adjacency information for efcient resemblance detection in existing deduplication systems and employs an improved super-feature approach to further detecting resemblance when the duplicate-adjacency information is lacking or limited Our preliminary results on the data-restore performance suggest that supplementing delta compression to deduplication can effectively enlarge the logical space of the restoration cache but the data fragmentation in data reduction systems remains a serious problem  19  W e plan to further study and improve the data-restore performance of storage systems based on deduplication and delta compression in our future work This work was supported in part by National Basic Research 973 Program of China under Grant No 2011CB302301 NSFC No 61025008 61173043 and 61232004 863 Project 2013AA013203 US NSF under Grants IIS-0916859 CCF-0937993 CNS-1116606 and CNS-1016609 This work was also supported by Key Laboratory of Information Storage System Ministry of Education China

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
