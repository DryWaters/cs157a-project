003own using CC due to the complexity of the design and the mass 003ow rate requirements 5 Less comple x designs that achieve high lift coef\002cients with low drag forces need to be investigated The main problem with circulation control wings is the need for high energy air that must be blown through the trailing edge of the wing during 003ight Solutions implemented in the past used either air that is taken from the engine 050this method reduces the engine's power production\051 or the exhaust gases from the engine after they are 002rst cooled down 6 Because of this problem this research centers on 002nding the best con\002guration that gives high lift augmentation ratios for reasonably low blowing rates Low blowing rates require less energy consumption which enables circulation control to be applied on UAVs The effectiveness of circulation control in generating lift on a Clark-Y airfoil pro\002le type is also investigated The Clark-Y airfoil is not only widely used in remote control planes but also in general purpose aircraft designs For experimental assessment a three-dimensional wing with an aspect ratio of 2 is built The CCW is created by the integration of one slot for blowing located on the upper surface near the trailing edge of the wing Lift and drag measurements were taken using a low speed wind tunnel Four Coanda surfaces were tested in this study and the results show that the smallest Coanda surface is more effective The maximum lift enhancement 050up to 155 051 at zero angle-ofattack C 026  0  04 and Mach  0  03 is achieved by using the con\002guration with the smallest Coanda surface The data indicate that upper slot blowing results in drag reduction as the moment coef\002cient increases Drag force does not appear to increase as the Coanda surface increases The main contribution of this paper is to propose the design and implementation of a CCW that gives high lift augmentation ratios at zero and non-zero angles of attack with reasonably low blowing rates The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 3 summarizes the literature review related to our study while Section 4 discusses the description of the model and the method that is designed and built Section 5 describes the facilities while Section 6 analyzes the testing procedures Section 7 discusses the results and 002nally Section 8 concludes the paper 3 R ELATED W ORK In the late 1970's circulation control w as applied by Robert J Englar on the trailing edge of an A-6 003ight demonstrator 002xed wing aircraft in order to achieve larger lift coef\002cient values during take-off and landing A system that combines a CCW with upper surface blowing was developed with a NACA 64A008.4 050modi\002ed\051 model The 2Dimensional wind tunnel tests show a lift coef\002cient of 6.5 and 3-Dimensional case was found to a factor of 2.2 greater than the non-blowing case In continuation to this project Nichols and Englar reduce by nearly 100 the actuators 003aps and other traditional high lift systems on the wing Also they show that direct lift control on approach is independent of thrust setting and was controlled by changes in the bleed air rate supplied to the wing In Jones and Englar conduct research on high lift concepts and how that addresses drag reduction and mass 003ow reduction by using pulsed pneumatic blowing on a Coanda surface Due to challenges associated with engine bleed and blunt blown trailing edge issues during the cruise 003ight pneumatic control of aerodynamic high lift techniques have not frequently been used in production aircraft Dual-slot blo wing modi\002cation w as us ed in order to create a virtual trailing edge to minimize cruise drag while at the same time maintain an effective Coanda surface Computational 003uid dynamics 050CFD\051 simulation results show that the degree of jet turning around the Coanda surface can be related to 003ow separation from the surface to the slot height the surface radius the jet velocity or even to the geometry of the Coanda surface It was also shown that the more the blowing level increases the more the separation point moves around the Coanda surface towards the maximum of the airfoil 050x/c 1\051 as Figure 2 shows Figure 2  CFD simulation of trailing edge boundary layer control and jet entrainment penetration around a Coanda surface Additionally following pulsed blowing tests verify that a given lift value can be obtained at lower time-average mass 003ow rates than steady state 003ow It also con\002rmed previous research which claims that for steady state blowing higher jet velocity ratios from smaller slots at constant C 026 produce better entrainment and lift augmentation 10 Circulation Control was 002rst used on an unmanned model aircraft scale 050AUW  7kg\051 at the University of Manchester  The goal of this project w as to use 003apless 003ight control technologies on a UAV less than 7Kg The Irvine Tutor 40 almost ready to 003y remote control aircraft was used A fully operational 003ight control system based on 003ow control and 003uidic thrust vectoring technologies was developed Those 003ow control techniques have not been successfully implemented as primary 003ight controls according to the author  A pneumatic system that pro vides roll cont rol through asymmetric lift augmentation was designed That system worked by blowing a jet of air through a thin slot above a circular trailing edge Two options to provide air supply were considered Compressed air bottle supply was tried 002rst but soon ruled out due to weight restrictions The mass 003ow rate was measured to be 0.06Kg/s at 3kPa which were suitable values for both CC and control 003uidic thrust vectoring on the aircraft A method to estimate the lift curves or changes of lift curves of a circulation-control wing at low speeds was proposed by Ran et al The proposed method 002rst estimates the jet speed out of the slot on information provided for the mass 003ow rate by using a valid assumption of the loss of some total pressure because of viscous friction from the plenun to the nozzle exit The authors show that the jet speed can be calculated by the following equation 2

supersonic if the ratio 050 aP tduct  P 1 051 is greater than 1.89 An empirical method that estimates the lift coef\002cient of the wing and the change of the wing-lift coef\002cient caused by the CC was also proposed A wind tunnel experiment was conducted on a 6 thick camber elliptical circulation control airfoil with both upper and lower blowing at the NASA Langley Research Center Three elliptical trailing edge surfaces were manufactured 050Figure 3\051 Alexander et al tested three upper and lo wer slot heights for each Coanda surface It was shown that by decreasing the slot height and increasing the Coanda surface the effectiveness was increased at transonic cruise conditions and angle of attack equal to  3 o  At low speed conditions and at the same angle of attack the effectiveness increases by decreasing both parameters Also trailing edge blowing in\003uences the 003ow 002eld upstream of the slot Based on the lift and momentum coef\002cient data no appreciable Coanda surface nor slot height preference was found with dual slot blowing However dual slot blowing resulted in reduction of the airfoil's baseline drag at Mach  0.8 Figure 3  Aft Surface Identi\002cation In research w as focused on 003ight dynamics on the FLAVIIR project which was a 002ve year research program with the collaboration of ten British Universities The main objective of this program was the development of technologies that can provide low cost 003apless UAVs without the conventional control surfaces Demon  which is a delta wing tailless con\002guration and powered by a gas turbine engine was selected for this project For circulation control a 003ow control actuator capable of proportional bidirectional control was used To design the model of the actuator a single upper slot was used to provide the circulation control According to the authors the performance of circulation control depends on the momentum coef\002cient and thus the pneumatic system is characterized as a function of it An analysis of the equations was given and the dependence on height slot was explained The fact that the smaller slots provide higher jet velocities for a constant momentum coef\002cient was also mentioned Finally a detailed analysis regarding the dependence of the actuator control angle on the incremental lift was given 4 M ODEL D ESCRIPTION The wing con\002guration that was tested in this experimental investigation was a semi-span Clark-Y modi\002ed airfoil shape The wing was rapid prototyped and the material that was used was acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 050ABS\051 The model was supported by a formable brass tube that was integrated into the test section of the wind tunnel as depicted in Figure 4 such that lift and drag data can be collected The wing model has an isolated internal plenum that provides air to the rectangular slot upstream of the trailing edge The wing was designed in a way that the trailing edge can be removed and replaced The slot extends at the 80 of the full span of the model has a 002xed height of h  0.7mm and it was located at x/cref  0.89 Figure 4  Circulation Control Wing model with 0502:1\051 Coanda surface attached The model is shown in the wind tunnel's circular test section Circulation Control Wing The Clark-Y airfoil is chosen for these experiments because it is widely used in general purpose aircraft design and is well studied in aerodynamics since 1922 when the pro\002le was designed It has a thickness of 11.7 and because of its high chamber produces a high lift-to-drag ratio The chord length of the wing before the design modi\002cation was c ref  150 mm and the span was S  300 mm in order to keep an aspect ratio of 2  The chord of the wing without the trailing edge after the design modi\002cation has a length of 134mm The full chord length of the model after each of the trailing edges 050Coanda surfaces\051 was attached and the total wing area are

Figure 5 The major and minor axis of each Coanda surface are positioned in a way that the slot is 002xed at x/cref  0.89 and the slot height is 002xed and equal to h  0.7mm in all four experiments Alexander et al report no in\003uence on lower slot blowing subsonically thus it was decided to apply only upper blowing on this wind tunnel investigation It was decided to test Coanda surface radius close to the radius dimensions that were tested in b ut with bigger lengthto-height ratios in order to investigate the in\003uence of the 3

Figure 12  No blowing case C D vs Angle-of-Attack for experimental and theoretical data The experimental data are taken from wind tunnel testing for various speeds and angles of attack The theoretical data derived from XFLR5 analysis tool In Figure 13 the variation of the lift coef\002cient with angle of attack for the smallest Coanda surface 0502:1\051 is seen We observe that increasing the moment coef\002cient C 026  creates positive lift increments but the effectiveness decreases at higher blowing rates The highest value of lift coef\002cient C L was measured at the maximum blowing rate and at the angle of attack of 13 o degrees The 5 points on the plot show the behavior of the wing during level 003ight 050low angles of attack 0 o and 3 o 051 and take-off 050 11 o  13 o  15 o 051 The data indicate that the blowing technique works as expected and provides lift enhancement across a wide range of angles of attack Figure 13  Variation of the lift coef\002cient with angle of attack for the smallest Coanda surface 050 2  1 051 con\002guration Lift augmentation ratio The 001 C L 000 C 026 plot at M  0  029 for 013  13 o is seen in Figure 14 The 001 C L 000 C 026 slope the lift augmentation ratio as it is referred in aerodynamics is 29 up to C 026  0  0026 for the 0502:1\051 Coanda surface Although in theory good circulation airfoils should achieve augmentation ratios between 50 to 70  a ratio of 29 is a good accomplishment because according to Alexander et al jet 003aps attain augmentation ratios of approximately 14 The comparison between all four Coanda surfaces shows that the smallest Coanda surface 0502:1\051 performs better by giving higher lift augmentation ratios The data show that with a low blowing rate a high lift augmentation ratio can be achieved at a high angle of attack 013  13 o which is close to the angle of attack needed for take-off This indicates that lift enhancement can be achieved at this angle with relatively little additional energy added Figure 14  001 C L 000 C 026  A comparison between all four Coanda surfaces is presented The incremental lift coef\002cient is plotted against the moment coef\002cient In Figure 15 the Coanda surface effect on all tailing edges that were tested is seen The plot 050 001 C L C 026 C 026 051 shows that as the moment coef\002cient C 026 increases the lift augmentation ratio decreases With the only exception to be the 002rst value of the 0503:1\051 Coanda surface the data of the other three Coanda surfaces follow the same trend as the data of the smallest Coanda surface The data show that the smaller the Coanda surface the greater the augmentation ratio In Figure 16 the data follow the same trend and show the behavior of the augmentation ratio as the velocity ratio increases An overall decrease on the lift augmentation ratio was observed as the blowing ratio was increased For higher velocity ratios the in\003uence of blowing is lower and that was observed from the low values that the lift augmentation ratio takes Figure 15  001 C L C 026 000 C 026  The ratio of the incremental lift coef\002cient to moment coef\002cient is calculated and plotted against different moment coef\002cient rates The smallest Coanda surface gives the highest augmentation ratio at all times Drag Drag measurements were acquired by measuring the drag force that was transmitted to the tube which was supporting the wing model in the wind tunnel 050Figure 8\051 Figure 17 shows the drag coef\002cient plot for the smallest Coanda 6 


Figure 16  001 C L C 026 000 V jet V inf ty  The ratio of the incremental lift coef\002cient to moment coef\002cient is calculated and plotted against the velocity ratio An overall decrease on the lift augmentation ratio is observed as the blowing ratio is increased surface at 013  15 o for different free stream velocities The plot also shows the initial thrust which is the thrust that is gained when the free stream velocity is zero It was observed that as the free stream velocity was increasing the drag coef\002cient decreases and was approaching the initial thrust curve Moreover it is seen that as C 026 increases the drag decreases in all three different velocities This ef\002ciency is a result of the slot nozzle blowing From the data that were collected in this investigation an increase in drag force as the Coanda surface increases was not observed Figure 17  C D 000 C 026  The drag coef\002cient C D is plotted against the moment coef\002cient at 013  15 o for the smallest Coanda surface at different speeds In this experimental work four Coanda surfaces were tested and the results show that the smallest Coanda surfaces is more effective A comparison between the blowing and noblowing case at different angles of attack reveal that the CC technique increases the lift of the wing as the blowing rate increases A second comparison between all four Coanda surfaces indicate that the smallest Coanda surface gives the highest lift augmentation ratio at 013  13 o  To our knowledge and experience UAVs with a wing span of 1 meter or less can take-off from around 12 o to 15 o degrees thus the combination of a high augmentation ratio at 13 o degrees at a low blowing rate indicates that the wing can provide enhanced lift with low power consumption during take-off Finally drag force does not appear to increase as the Coanda surface increases and upper slot blowing results in drag reduction as the moment coef\002cient increases In conclusion the data reveal that lift enhancement on a UAV can be achieved at zero and non-zero angles of attack with reasonable blowing rates 8 C ONCLUSIONS A low Reynolds number study that details the design and the implementation of a CCW providing increased lift capabilities at zero and non zero angles of attack and can be suitable for a battery-powered or fuel-powered small scale UAV is implemented and tested at the University of Denver A wind tunnel investigation at low Mach and Reynolds numbers on a modi\002ed Clark-Y airfoil is conducted 3-Dimensional results for lift and drag data from 0 o to 15 o degrees angle-of-attack and velocities of 0 to 0  03 Mach are collected Incremental lift coef\002cient and lift augmentation ratio data are presented to support the Coanda surface effects The highest incremental lift coef\002cient observed is 001 C L  0  42 at blowing coef\002cient of C 026  0  04  Considerable increase of the drag as the Coanda surface increases is not observed The data indicate that upper slot blowing causes the reduction of the drag force as the moment coef\002cient increases The net observed effect of CC is signi\002cant lift enhancement when the smallest Coanda surface con\002guration is used Although CC on small unmanned aerial vehicles has not received much attention it is shown that usable lift increment can be achieved with blowing coef\002cients of order C 026 031 0  04  Lift enhancement on a UAV can be achieved during level 003ight and take-off with reasonably low blowing rates which means relatively low energy consumption The end goal of this research is to use this approach to develop a 002xed-wing UAV able of caring more payload than it was initially designed to carry and be able to accomplish short take-offs and landings With this in mind the next step will be focused on a comparative study between the modi\002ed wing tested and presented in this paper and a NACA pro\002le airfoil Finally a study will be conducted on an energy ef\002cient method that will provide the air to the aircraft on board A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is partially supported by U.S National Science Foundation 050NSF\051 Grant CNS-1229236 R EFERENCES   K C P\002ngsten and R Radespiel Experimental and numerical investigation of a circulation control airfoil  47th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting Including The New Horizons Forum and Aerospace Exposition Orlando Florida 2009   J Abramson The Low Speed Characteristics of a 15-Percent Quasi-Elliptical Circulation Control Airfoil with Distributed Camber David W Taylor Naval Ship Center Report DTNSRDC/ASED-79/07 050AD-A084176\051 May 1979   K Ahuja L Sankar R Englar and Y Munro S Liu Applications of Circulation Control Technology to Airframe Noise Reduction GTRI Report NASA Grant February 15 2000 7
