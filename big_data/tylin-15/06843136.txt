In this paper, we discuss the different approaches according to which this information could be leveraged using a Big Data approach. In particular, we focus on Big Data Empowered Self Organiz ed Networks, discussing its most peculiar traits, its potential, and the relevant related work as well as analysing several cases of its possible application Finally, we report the results of a case study targeting networkwide Dropped Call/Bad QoS minimization, with the aim of answering the question of how big is the big data to be dealt with according to the proposed approach Keywords— Self Organized Networks; Big Data; 5G; Network Optimization I   I NTRODUCTION  A huge amount of measurement control and management information is generated during th e normal operation of today’s 3G and 4G mobile networks. This amount is expected to grow even more for future 5G mobile networks, for various reasons 1\xpected higher density of ba se stations, which is needed to provide the target capacity increase of 5G systems; 2 higher number of mobile terminals that is expected to come with the Machine To Machine \(M2M\Internet of Things IoT\digms; 3 ng variety of application and services, each with distinct traffic patterns and QoS requirements; 4 ce of an increasing number of mobile technologies, each with its additional complexity and peculiarities; 5 roduction of new architectural paradigms, such as Software Defined Networks \(SDN\and Network Function Virtualization \(NFV We are now in the information age, where Big Data approaches have already demonstrated in a variety of cases that it is possible to leverage such huge amounts of information to develop innovative solutions, as well as to bring more power and additional value to existing ones. Because of this, we believe that a Big Data approach applied to the huge amount of information generated within 5G Mobile Networks could yield significant benefits for all th e players: network equipment vendors could offer more competitive solutions, mobile network operators could improve their profit margins customers could get better service at lower prices, new business opportunities could aris e for Big Data services aimed at mobile networks and, finally the public administration and society could also benefit by using mobile network data for other services and applications Among all these opportunities, in this paper we analyse in detail the possibility of applying a Big Data approach to Self Organized Networks \(SONs\hich we find particularly promising and appealing. The reason for this is that existing 4G networks are already very complex and costly to manage and even though SON solutions have been researched over the last several years, these solutions are still struggling to provide a comprehensive global network management. 5G networks are expected to become even more complex in order to address upcoming challenges, such as the foreseen need for a 1000x increase in capacity as well as the integration of new networking paradigms like IoT/M2M, SDNs, etc. As we will detail in this paper, we believe that state-of-the-art SON approaches suffer from a number of limitations, and for this reason their effectiveness in a 5G scenario would not be sufficient to achieve the global network optimization and operational cost reduction goals. For this reason, we foresee the advent of Big Data Empowered SONs \(BES\ost effective solution to autonomic network management for 5G systems Taking the above discussion as a basis, in the rest of the paper we provide the following contributions. In Section II we provide a general overview of the main sources of information that are available within a mob ile network. In Section III we propose a high-level classification of the opportunities for a Big Data approach applied to mobile networks. Then, in Section IV, we focus on BES; in this context, we discuss the related work and other releva nt background information. We propose different use cases for BES in Section V, and in Section VI we analyse in detail one of them, associated with the critical problem of reduci ng the call dropping in cellular networks. Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section VII II  S OURCES OF INFORMATION WITHIN A MOBILE NETWORK  The huge amount of information that we referred to in the introduction comes from various network elements, such as base stations, mobile terminals, gateways and management entities, and can be classified in the following categories 1 Control information rela ted to regular short-term network operation, covering f unctionalities such as call/session set-up, release and maintenance, security, QoS, idle and connected mode mobility, and radio resource control 2 Control information re lated to SON functions associated to the optimization and maintenance of cellular This work was made possible by NPRP grant No. 5-1047-2-437 from the Qatar National Research Fund \(a member of The Qatar Foundation statements made herein are solely the responsibility of the authors  European Wireless 2014 181 ISBN 978-3-8007-3621-8 VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany

In this section, we provide a high-level classificati on of the different purposes for which such approach could be exploited A  Big-data Empowered SONs \(BES By leveraging all the informati on available within a mobile network, a Big-data Empowered SONs \(BES\can bring mobile networks to Op erational Excellence. Here are some practical examples  Instead of simple threshold based network fault detection systems that require engineer intervention to run further measurements \(e.g., by turning on tracing find out the source of the problem, a BES would autonomously identify the cause of the problem based on the previously recorded data and fix it with little or no engineer intervention. An advanced BES solution could even prevent problems before they occur  The currently open challenge of coordination among SON functions could be solved by a BES, by analysing the correlation among conflicting performance goals of different SON functions, and dynamically determining the operating point that provides the best performance trade-off  Data traditionally unavailable for network management purposes, such as CDRs, could be leveraged by a BES for example to find out typi cal mobility patterns of users, and proactively take network optimization actions, such as taking informed handover decision concentrating spectrum re sources in location with higher user densities, and turning off selected base stations when they are foreseen to be not needed B  Network-Aware Business Intelligence According to the NetworkAware Business Intelligence NABI ss intelligence of the mobile operator can be significantly strengthened by a Big Data approach. Here are some examples  With NABI, Customer Service can move from a reactive approach - the user detects a problem, calls customer services, and after many interactions eventually, an engineer fixes the problem - to a proactive approach: for example, customer service can be aware of the problem before the user calls to complain, and promptly provide a solution \(e.g promise a fix, or offer some compensation\to keep the customer happy  A NABI approach could leverage the correlation between network performance and customer churn information to retain customers. For example, the operator could find out which are the network performance issues most related with past churn, and then proactively identi fy users that are likely to churn in the future due to network performance issues, and offer them some compensatory benefit  NABI can also be leveraged to take informed business decisions. For example, the operator could find out that the insufficient network infrast ructure in some area is a major cause of churn, and decide to invest in better infrastructure there C  Open Mobile Network Data With an adequate regulati on and appropriate means to guarantee the necessary privacy and security, mobile network operators could export the data gathered within their network to other companies, institutions, an d to the public, to achieve different benefits, realizing the paradigm that we call Open Mobile Network Data \(OMND\Here are some examples  OMND would be a key enabler for a lot of Smart City use cases, such as public transport network optimization, demographics urban planning, etc  OMND could be leveraged by third parties for providing location and cont ext-aware content and services In the remainder of this pape r, we will focus exclusively on BES, deferring NABI and OMND to future work IV  B ACKGROUND AND C URRENT T RENDS FOR BES In this section, we will discuss some reference material in order to provide the reader with the necessary background information on BES as well as with an overview of its current trends of evolution A  Academic While Big Data is currently a hot topic in the Computing  m  Big Data” is still relatively new in the context of Mobile Networks. However, we argue that the idea of BES has been around for much longer, just with different names. To name a few seminal papers in this respect both the Knowledge Plane appr  Network paradigm form have the sam e o v erall purpose of a SON, i.e., realizing an automatic network configuration, management a nd optimization, and qualify as a Big Data problem as soon as th e network size is non-trivial. As another example, Autonomic Networks have the goal of removing the man-in-the-loop from network manageme   or at least lig stated that this approach in future networks will require novel monitoring architectures together with advanced data analytics  o be s u ccessful; these aspects m a ke Future Autonomic Networks quite in line with the BES approach As we said previously, the term Big Data has started to be used in a mobile network context only very recently, and mostly for applications that are outside the scope of the operation of the mobile network itself; an interesting example of such type of work can be fo  o weve r, only a few  publications address the use of a Big Data approach aimed at mobile network management and optimization. Some examples  r e the authors apply a Big Data  approach to the measurements gathered in a mobile network in European Wireless 2014 183 ISBN 978-3-8007-3621-8 VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany 


order to carry out an enhanced Network Coverage analysis, and  where a similar approa ch is instead used to characte rize data plane traffic and applications. We note that these publications focus almost exclusively on the data analysis part but the exploitation of such analysis for network management and optimization is not addressed B  Standardization The concept of SON is quite well established in the standardization of mobile networ k technologies. The use cases for SON up to now are define Each SON use case focuses on the optimization of a particular KPI at a specific layer of the protocol stack; add itionally, different use cases have, in most cases, conflicting goals, and how to optimize them jointly is an open issue. BES has a much larger scope i.e., it affects a big portion of the network, and possibly considers the whole protocol stack, all the planes \(control, user management\ all the network segments \(access, transport core\customer service information. In some sense, a traditional SON can be seen as a special case of BES with a limited focus As we discussed in the introd uction, the current operational practice of 3GPP is reactive: only minimal information is commonly gathered for anomaly detection purposes \(e.g. RLF and tracing only activated when an anomaly is detected furthermore, the tracing is typically performed manually by the engineer. The crucial difference of the BES approach is that tracing is always on, and the actions are taken automatically without the need for human intervention. We note that BES can be realized with the information that can be gathered via the already standardized protocols and interfaces; in other words the 3GPP standard is already ready for BES, it is mostly a matter for equipment manufacturer to integrate the necessary Big Data tools and solutions that can make it real. This of course does not preclude the possi bility of standardizing further mobile network data sources that could allow the realization of novel BES features In the remainder of this subsection, we provide an overview of the 3GPP technical specifications that are most relevant for the realization of a BES solution To start with Charging Data Records CDRs  p rehens ive set of statistics at the service, bearer and IMS levels. These records are typically stored for offline processing by the operator and, because of this, they have been the first type of data involved in mobilenetwork related big data resear ch studies. The granularity of this information in the time dom ain is however quite coarse, as records are generated in correspondence with high-level service events \(e.g., start of a call\data for BES is expected to be limited to the same coarse time scale e.g., network optimization on an hourly basis The Performance Management functionality, whose concept and requirements are st  d ily provides a significant amount of data on network performance that could be leveraged for BES. The available data is defined  ong others the following aspects of the performance of the radio access network: Radio Resource Control and Utilization, performance of the various bearers both on the radio part and in th e backhaul\idle and connected mode mobility The Minimization of Drive Tests MDT defines some Radio Measurem pr ovided by the UEs which are aimed at coverage optimization. These radio measurements are both idle and connected mode mobility cover items such as power measurements and radio link failure events, and can be associated with position information on the UE performing the measurement E-UTRA Control plane protocols and interfaces such as  the S1-AP [17] a nd the X2-AP protocols [18 are also a potential major data source relevant for BES especially concerning aspects such as cell coverage, UE connectivity, mobility in idle and connected mode, inter-cell interference, resource management, load balancing, etc. A subset of this information is in fact processed to obtain part of the measurement information that we introduced previously in this section; however, most of the information is actually discarded after it fulfilled its purpose. Rather than being discarded, it could be retained and leveraged for a BES approach Data plane traffic flow statistics are also an important source of information potentially us eful for BES. This data can be gathered at various points in the mobile network, e.g., at the eNB, at the SGW and at the PGW. On this ma is an example of standardized format for the exchange of such statistics In this subsection, we have mainly focused on 3GPP standardization efforts, given thei r relevance to the way BES is understood in this paper. We note, however, that there are efforts undertaken by other st andardization bodies with a somewhat different scope, but wh ich could be also of potential interest for BES, at least partially. Some relevant examples in this category are the Autonomi c network engineering for the self-managing Future Internet \(AFI\ ETSI Industry Specification Group \(ISG with a generic network management perspective, or the TM Forum, with a businessoriented perspective on the operation of the network C  Commercial products At the time of this writing, no BES product is already on the market, to the best of our knowledge. However, there are several products which include key components of what would be a BES system, and whose presence confirms that the underlying technology is ready for the design and development of BES solutions. In this section, we discuss a few examples Network monitoring solutions such as  pro vide m eans for interception and analysis of huge volumes of traffic; other products in the same claimed in their advertisement to include big data analytics capabilities. This type of solutions could be adopted in mobile networks to complement othe r sources of information, e.g., by providing an insight on e nd-to-end application level performance thanks to deep packet inspection We see an increasing interest in the industry for bringing network management solutions traditionally adopted for European Wireless 2014 184 ISBN 978-3-8007-3621-8 VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany 


general IP networks, such as PP based m obile networks Some mobile ne already said to include some Big Data functionality that would allow to analyse the correlation between network traffic and end-user Quality of Experience. However, it is unclear to what extent it can support network self-organ ization, which is the primary target of BES V  BES  U SE C ASES  In this section we provide an overview of some use cases where we foresee that the BES approach could be adopted A  Call dropped / Bad QoS A definition of these two use cases can be Appendix A. The state-of-the-art approach to address this use  based on the reactive use of the tracing system, i.e., no trace is active during normal usage, and only after a fault is detected \(e.g., after a customer complaint is received\tracing of the relevant measurements for the affected network elements, to identify and fix the cause of the problem A first innovation with respect to the state of the art would be a Big Data assisted approach, where the trace sources are always activated for all network elements. A monitoring system would then periodically ch eck this data, and eventually trigger notifications to the system engineers, attaching the associated measurement traces, so that the engineers can promptly identify the cause of the problem and fix it, without the need for post-mortem tracing. The amount of monitoring data transmitted would be signi ficantly higher compared with the reactive approach; however, the computational demand for the processing of this data would s till be relatively low due to the simple processing op erations involved A further innovation would be achieved with a BES approach, where, in addition to the data sources of the former approach \(which is basically KPIs\rresponding relevant network configuration would also be gathered. An intelligent agent would then continuously an alyse this data, and refine the network configuration to minimize dropped calls and occurrences of bad QoS.  The amount of data gathered would have a further slight increase with respect to the big-data assisted approach; however the computational demand for processing and analysing this da ta would become significantly higher, because of the complex processing required by the intelligent agent to determine the factors that cause the problem, as well as the best solution to fix it B  Self Organized Network Optimization According to the 3GPP specifications, the SON approach to Network Optimization is referred to as self-optimization Several use cases are identified, including Mobility Robustness MLB cell Interference Coordination \(IC IC Optimization \(CCO\ndom Access Channel \(RACH optimization [2 26   The state-of-the-art approach is the following. When it is identified that a Network Eleme nt \(e.g., the eNB optimize some parameters, those are locally updated based on automatic optimization algorithms. As an example, the MRO use case focuses on the reduction of the call drop rate due to failed handover \(HO s. The state-of-the-art MRO approach consists in evaluating the HO failure events, and detecting the guilty cell based on the control information messages that are interchanged among NEs for the HO procedure. The HO parameters are then updated with the aim of performing the correct HO decision in the future. We note however, that the objectives of the different SON use cases are conflicting. For example, the HO parameters optimized in the MRO case that we just discussed are the same parameters that would be optimized by the MLB function. So, the MRO optimization may affect the MLB, which would then affect the ICIC, which in turn would affect the CCO, etc A BES approach, on the other hand, would consist in identifying the set of messages, measurements and statistics to monitor online, for all the use cases, and propose a multiobjective optimization approach in a coordinated fashion. On this matter, the live analysis of the impact of different parameter settings on the vari ous optimization objectives in different environmental conditions is crucial in order to cope with the complexity of 3GPP technologies and the heterogeneity of the possible deployment conditions C  Big data for Network Sharing optimization The use cases of Network Sharing \(NS\ are described in  ric idea am ong all these use cases is that an Infrastructure Provider \(InP es its network infrastructure to several Participating Operators POs RAN resource sharing gra nularities and dynamics, and different possible business models. The associated Operations Administration and Maintenance issues are discussed in [2 we note that one of the key enabling technologies for Network Sharing is Network Function Virtualization \(NFV The current approach to NS is that the InP statically configures all the network entities \(i.e., eNB, MME, SGW\for each virtual network operator \(VNO\ple, with a virtual machine for each network entity. The performance of the virtualization framework of the InP is monitored at a coarse level, e.g., with periodic measurements of the CPU load at servers, total network load in a rack with several NEs, etc Engineers check this monitoring information and rearrange the configuration in case a problem is detected, e.g., manually transferring some NEs to other servers in case of overload On the other hand, a BES approach would involve the online optimization of the locati on of NEs in terms of data centre, rack inside data centre, and server inside rack. This could be done for a single PO, but also globally \(i.e., across all POs within this InP ng the traffic through interfaces connecting NEs of various VNOs. When multiple POs share the same spectrum and eNB \(via eNB virtualization optimization process could jointly consider the position and traffic demand of users of multiple VNOs to decide, for instance, that a certain virtual eNB of a PO is to be deactivated in order to allow more resources for the co-located virtual eNB of another PO that might be facing a traffic peak. Additionally the reduction in the energy cons umption of the InP could be another driving objective for the optimization European Wireless 2014 185 ISBN 978-3-8007-3621-8 VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany 


D  Increase global capacity/throughput density A BES approach could provide an effective means for achieving an increase in the overall network capacity by optimizing the exploitation of a collection of available radio access technologies and configuration. For example, based on the variations in the traffic demand of the users and of their positions with respect to cellular base stations and WiFi access points, and monitoring inform ation of the various relevant parameters of both the cellular and WiFi network infrastructure, a BES solution could dynamically aggregate multiple technologies, purcha se spectrum on-demand, adjust transmission powers to meet different capacity/coverage tradeoffs, or design the be st global flow patte rn and appropriately redirect traffic to obtain more aggregated throughput with the same resources VI  C ASE STUDY  HOW BIG IS BIG DATA FOR A BES  APPROACH TO THE C ALL D ROPPED B AD Q O S USE CASE  In this section we consider a practical use case for BES and model it making some simplifying assumptions, in order to get some rough figures about how big is the big data that would be involved in a BES approach co mpared with state-of-the-art solutions A  Use case definition We consider the Call Dropped/Bad QoS case that we previously discussed in Section V.A. For this use case, we assume that a minimal BES solution could be implemented with the following pieces of information  Radio Link Failure RLF\information generated in correspondence with the occurrence of a RLF event such as when a handover fails, or the UE in connected mode moves out of coverage In particular, we consider the RLF Report contained w ithin the UE Information Response defined in the  RLF Indication defined in  H a ndover Report also defined in  Measurement Logging inform ation, as defined in  We assume that a BES approach would leave this logging permanently enabled for all UEs  UE Measurement Reports  periodically sends these reports to the eNB as part of the normal operation, either periodica lly or upon the occurrence of some condition related with the measurements \(e.g signal above/below thres holds discards it after usage. We consider that periodic reports are used, and that the whole content of all the reports is stored for BES usage  Load Information, defined in  which is periodically exchanged among eNBs for inter-cell interference coordination purposes  Resource Status Update, also which is periodically exchanged among eNBs for load balancing and mobility/capacity optimization purposes For comparison purposes, we will consider that a state-ofthe-art \(SoTA\ solution would only gather RLF information only keep logging enabled for 0.1% of the UEs, and discard the UE Measurement Reports, Load Information and Resource Status Update messages right after consumption by the receiving eNB We stress that the set of information elements that we consider for the BES approach is rather minimal; actual BES implementations could easily include many more parameters e.g., information from other 3GPP primitives, QoS and QoE measurements, and possibly also customer service information such as CDRs. Because of this, the figures that we will provide in Section VI.C for a BES solution will be quite conservative B  Modeling assumptions In this section we outline the modelling assumptions that we adopted to perform our quantification of the amount of big data involved in the use case being considered First we need an estimate of the amount of data that corresponds to each of the messages listed in the previous section. To this aim, we note that most of the data comes from 3GPP specs where they are encoded often with the ASN.1 Packet Encoding Rules, which is highly compressed and efficient, but would cause an additional processing burden on a Big Data solution. We assume that, for a BES approach, the same data items are stored in a decoded format, which allows easy processing at the cost of slightly increased storage requirements. In particular, c onsistently with the storage requirements of typical database systems, and with the need for using global identifiers, we assume that  Integers are stored in the minimum number of bytes required for storing the value range  Enum values are stored in one byte  Bitmask fields of length bits are stored in  bytes  ECGI values are stored in 6 bytes  IMSI values are stored in 8 bytes Second, in order to make each data record identifiable within the BES framework, we make the further following assumptions  The C-RNTI field is translated to the corresponding IMSI  The physCellId field is translated to the corresponding ECGI  For each UE Measurement Report, the IMSI of the reporting UE and the ECGI of the serving cell are also stored Third, we need to estimate how many messages of each kind would be generated. On this matter, we made the following assumptions for our calculations  Each UE expe riences on average a RLF event every 20 min  Measurement Logging is always active with the minimum allowed interval of 1280 ms  The report interval for UE Measurements is 240ms minimum allowed value European Wireless 2014 186 ISBN 978-3-8007-3621-8 VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany 


 The average interval between consecutive Load Information and Resource Status Update messages is 10 ms Fourth, some messages can contain multiple instances of some data structures, one for each cell for which information is reported. On this matter, in order to perform our calculations we made the following assumptions  Within each UE Measurement Report, data relative to 8 neighbour cells \(the maximum allowed number included  Each eNB has 3 cells for which it includes information within the Load Informa tion and Resource Status Update messages  Each cell is interfered by 8 neighbour cells, with whom it interchanges inter-cell interference coordination information via the Load Information message Finally, we need some assumptions on the network topology in order to derive our figures on how big is big data for a BES approach. To this aim, we adopt the values proposed  for a res i dential deploym ent, i.e  The UE density is 10000 UE/km2  The macro eNB density is 4.62 eNB/km2  The pico/femto eNB density is ranging from 50 to 100 eNB/km2, which, according p onds to a  total network capacity ranging approximately from 50 to 300 GB/h/km2 C  Results In Fig. 2 we show the amount of data that would be gathered per unit area following respectively the BES and SoTA approach. The most striking aspect of the results is that the transition from a SoTA approach to a BES approach implies an increase on the amount of data to be handled between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude. Additionally, we note that the BES approach exhibits a significant dependence on the small cell \(pico/femto\hereas the SoTA approach is constant. This is due to the fact that, as per our assumptions, the amount of information gathered by the SoTA approach depends only on the UE density, but not on the eNB density. Considered the volume of the data, the velocity of processing that a BES solution would require in order to satisfactorily address the use cases that we discussed in Section V, and the variety in the data itself due to the very complex interdependencies among the variables involved, we observe that the BES approach has indeed all the characteristics of a Big Data problem In Fig. 3 we report the average network load per eNB due to the collection of the network information needed as input for the BES optimization. We assumed that the network load is shared equally among eNBs regardl ess of their type; while not very accurate \(e.g., the actual load per eNB would vary according to how many UEs are associated to each eNB assumption can still yield a meani ngful order of magnitude of the considered metric. From the figure, we note that the SoTA approach has a network load on the order of kilobits per second per eNB, compared to the order of megabits per second per eNB of the BES approach. We note that these figures do not take into account any protocol overhead, so the actual network load would be probably slightly larger Overall, the results that we ju st presented show that the realization of a BES solution will require significant investments in data processing infrastructure as well as in additional network capacity. Because of this, a BES approach will only make sense if it is effectively able to achieve a significant improvement in network performance and efficiency as well as a reduction in network runni ng costs. On this respect, we argue that more research on practical BES solutions is needed in order to be able to evaluate their effectiveness and viability in real network deployments VII  CONCLUSIONS In this paper we introduced the concept of Big Data Empowered Self Organized Networks, discussing its main  Fig. 3  Network load per eNB on the backhaul link due to the gathering of monitoring information for the BES and SOTA approaches defined in Section VI.A considering the assumptions described in Section VI.B 1.00 10.00 100.00 1000.00 10000.00 100000.00 1000000.00 10000000.00 25 50 100 200 400 800 1600 network load bit/s/eNB small cell eNB density eNB/km 2  BES SoTA  Fig. 2  Amount of mobile network data to be gathered and processed for the BES and SOTA approaches defined in Section VI.A considering the assumptions described in Section VI.B 0.01 0.10 1.00 10.00 100.00 1000.00 10000.00 25 50 100 200 400 800 1600 data amount GB/day/km 2  small cell eNB density eNB/km 2  BES SoTA European Wireless 2014 187 ISBN 978-3-8007-3621-8 VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany

  Paper 2581 Version 2  14   Flight i nformation and processing   Presentation and projection of flight profiles   Real time operational information   Managing both pilot operator and air traffic controller workloads   Procedural processes supported by enhanced automation capabilities   Control sector complexity and management   Separation a ssurance   Airspace d esign and p rocedures   Investment in resolving these constraints  will drive the rate of adoption in civil UAS operations in the NAS One p art of the investment will be driven by the FAA\222s \223F acilities and Equipment\224 F&E Budget over  the next ten years Another part will be driven by defense and federal investment  in R&D  The remaining part will be driven by private investment seeking to develop profitable supplie r s and manufacturing firms of UAS Unfortunately   private investment will not fully launch until there is a clear indication of the public investment into implementing the requisite air traffic management  and air traffic control  ATM/ATC changes into the NAS infrastructure and there i s a common  approach through avionic standards in UA V  equipage   It is expected that avionic standards would lower the end user costs The impact on NAS infrastructure is the outline in the following subsection  Today\222s Air Traffic Control System  Today\222s air traffic control system is built around four basic pillars. These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
