FAST AND ROBUST BOOTSTRAP METHOD FOR TESTING HYPOTHESES IN THE ICA MODEL Shahab Basiri Esa Ollila  Visa Koivunen Aalto University Dept of Signal Processing and Acoustics P.O.Box 13000 FI-00076 Aalto Finland ABSTRACT Independent component analysis ICA is a widely used technique for extracting latent unobserved source signals from observed multidimensional measurements In this paper we construct a fast and robust bootstrap FRB method for testing hypotheses on elements of the mixing matrix in the ICA model The FRB method can be devised for estimators which are solutions to xed-point FP equations In this paper we develop FRB test for the widely popular FastICA estimator The developed test can be used in real-world ICA analysis of high-dimensional data sets seen e.g in big data analysis as it avoids the common obstacles of conventional bootstrap such as immense computational cost and lack of robustness Moreover instability and convergence problems of the FastICA algorithm when applied to bootstrap data are prevented Simulations and examples illustrate the usefulness and validity of the developed test Index Terms  bootstrap FastICA hypothesis testing independent component analysis 1 INTRODUCTION Independent component analysis ICA is a widely used multivariate analysis technique with applications in many diverse elds Up to date the methodological estimation framework of ICA is mature and very well developed yet the inference hypothesis testing framework of ICA is still in its infancy In many ICA problems not all source signals are present in all recording mixtures Propagation of a source signal may be limited to a few sensors in the vicinity of the source-of-interest and sensors farther apart may not observe that source MEG is a good example of such sensing modality Therefore tests for hypotheses on the coefìcients of the mixing matrix are needed to investigate contribution of a speciìc source signal-of-interest onto a speciìc mixture variable which in turn reveals sparsity of the ICA mixing matrix Such tests can have variety of applications as is outlined in 2 In this paper we develop hypothesis tests on the coefìcients of the mixing matrix of the linear ICA model using a fast and robust bootstrap FRB 5 6 scheme The FRB method is applicable for any estimator that can be represented in form of xed-point FP equations Here we develop the method for the widely popular FastICA estimator 1 Recall that in the linear ICA model the observed random vector x  R d is a linear mixture of unobserved random source vector s  s 1 s d   possessing statistically independent components ICês i.e x  A s  a 1 s 1    a d s d  1 where A  a 1  a d  is the unknown full rank d  d mixing matrix whose coefìcients a ij  A  ij represent the contribution of the j th source s j onto the i th mixture variable x i  i j  1 d   Given a data set X  x 1  x n  of n i.i.d random vectors from the ICA model 1 the goal is to estimate the unknown demixing matrix W  A  1   w 1  w d    whose transposed row vector w i is the i th demixing vector  The data x is centered i.e has zero mean which also implies that E  s  0  A limitation of ICA is that for identiìablity of the demixing matrix up to sign scale and permutation ambiguity of the demixing vectors at most one source is allowed to possess a Gaussian distribution Furthermore due to scaling ambiguity we can adopt the convention that the sources are of unit variance i.e E  s 2 i 1 for i 1 d  Above we have assumed that the number of mixtures equals the number of sources This is not a limitation since the dimensionality of x can be reduced e.g by Principal Component Analysis PCA In this paper we develop bootstrap tests for hypothesis H 0  a ij 0 vs H 1  a ij  0  Bootstrap is a modern statistical inference tool based on data resampling and it has become an increasingly important tool in modern data analysis see text-books 8 9 for more details F o r e xample a conventional bootstrap test of level  rejects the null hypothesis if the 100\(1    conìdence interval formed by the bootstrap distribution of  a ij does not contain 0 Such a method is computationally impractical for high-dimensional HD data since it requires that the FastICA estimator  A   W  1 is calculated for several thousands of HD bootstrap samples On the other hand tests developed in 2 based on the asymptotic behavior of FastICA estimator perform poorly when the sample size is of the same magnitude as the dimension Moreover for real-world data the ICA model can be at best only approximately true and thus validity of tests based on asymptotic results can be questioned Another problem is instability and convergence problems of the FastICA algorithm when ap2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustic, Speech and Signal Processing \(ICASSP 978-1-4799-2893-4/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 6 


plied to high-dimensional data sets The developed FRB test avoids these problems it is fast to compute more robust and avoids the common convergence problems as the estimator need not be re for each bootstrap sample The paper is organized as follows In Section 2 the FRB method and the FastICA estimator are reviewed It is also shown that the FastICA estimator can be expressed as a solution to FP equation Conventional bootstrap hypothesis test e.g 8 using F astICA estimator is described in Section 3 followed by a construction of FRB hypothesis test in Section 4 Section 5 provides simulation examples and Section 6 concludes Relations to prior work References 2 construct tests based on asymptotic normality approximation of FastICA estimator Up to our best knowledge this paper provides rst contribution of bootstrap tests for purposes of testing hypotheses on elements of the mixing matrix 2 PRELIMINARIES 2.1 The FRB method Let   n  R m be an estimator of parameter of interest   R m based on data set X  x 1  x n   Throughout the paper X   x  1  x  n  denotes a bootstrap sample which is obtained by resampling with replacement from the columns of X  Compared with the conventional bootstrap the fast and robust bootstrap method 5 is computationally ef cient and robust to outliers It is applicable for estimators   n  R m that can be expressed as a solution to a system of smooth FP equations   n  Q    n  X   where Q  R m  R m  The bootstrap replicated estimator    n then solves    n  Q     n  X    where the function Q is same as above but now dependent on the bootstrap sample X   Then instead of computing    n we compute the approximation   1  n  Q    n  X    2 which is considered as a one-step estimator of    n with initial value   n  In conventional bootstrap one uses the distribution of    n to estimate the sampling distribution of   n  Since the distribution of the one-step estimator   1  n does not accurately reîect the sampling variability of    but typically underestimates it a linear correction is applied as follows   R  n    n   I Q    n  X    1    1  n    n   3 where Q     R m  m is the matrix of partial derivatives w.r.t   n  Then under sufìcient regularity conditions   R  n will be estimating the same limiting distribution as the actual bootstrap replications    n do In most applications   R  n is not only much easier to compute than    n  but numerically more stable and robust see 5 6 for details 2.2 FastICA Let us rst recall the principles of the deîation-based FastICA hereafter referred to as FastICA We then show that FastICA estimator can be expressed as a solution to a FP equation Our derivations and notations follow Let C  E  xx   denote the positive deìnite symmetric d  d covariance matrix of x  We deìne the inner product in the vector space R d as  w  v   w  C v  FastICA demixing vector w a transposed row vector of the demixing matrix is deìned as a maximizer of a non-Gaussianity measure  E  G  w  x     where G can be any twice continuously differentiable nonlinear and nonquadratic function with G 0  0  see 1 Chapter W e write g  G  and g   G  for the 1st and 2nd derivative of G respectively where g is referred to as the ICA nonlinearity  Then at the k th deîation stage the maximum of  E  G  w  x    is searched under the unit-norm constraint  w  2  w  C w 1 which implies unit variance of the sources and orthogonality-constraint with the previously found demixing vectors i.e  w  w i   w  C w i 0  Thus at the k th deîation stage the FastICA estimator w k maximizes the Lagrangian L  w   1  k   E  G  w  x     k  2  w  C w  1  k  1  i 1  i w  C w i  where  1  k are the Lagrange multipliers Hence the solution w k  needs to verify the following estimating equation obtained by setting the gradient of the Lagrangian w.r.t w to zero E  g  w  k x  x    k C w k  k  1  i 1  i C w i 0  where  i s are found to be  i  E  g  w  k x   w  i x    This equation can be rewritten as FP equation w k  1  k   k  1 C  1 m k  4 where m k  E  g  w  k x  x  and   k  1  I  k  1  i 1 w i w  i C  I  k  1  i 1  w i   w i is an orthogonal projection operator that project onto the orthogonal complement of the subspace of the inner product space spanned by the previously found demixing vectors w 1  w k  1  3 THE CLASSICAL BOOTSTRAP TEST FOR ICA Suppose the FastICA algorithm is run to nd an estimate of the demixing matrix  W  thus giving an estimate of the mixing matrix as  A   W  1  Let us recall some properties of 7 


FastICA that need to be considered when constructing a bootstrap procedure First recall from that the accurac y o f  W is heavily inîuenced by the extraction order of demixing vectors In other words the distribution of  W differs from one speciìc order of source extraction to another Hence it is important that for each bootstrap sample X   the extraction order of the sources remains the same as for the original FastICA demixing matrix estimator  W  The chance of maintaining the same order of extraction can be increased by using the original  W as the initial guess for the FastICA algorithm when applied for the bootstrap sample X   Nevertheless if the order of extraction is different from  W  one should discard the case and run the FastICA algorithm again for a new bootstrap sample Note that as the dimension d of the data increases the probability of discarding bootstrap samples tends to increase as well Second due to ICA ambiguities the sign of the demixing vectors may differ Thus after verifying that the same extraction order was found when running the algorithm for the bootstrap sample one needs to x the signs of the demixing vectors to match the signs of  W  Third when applied to bootstrap data it is not uncommon that the FastICA algorithm exhibits convergence problems In such cases another bootstrap sample needs to be drawn until the algorithm converges to a non-singular solution with right extraction order Considering the above obstacles and given that several thousands bootstrap samples are needed for hypothesis testing it is clear that the conventional bootstrap does not provide a feasible solution especially for high-dimensional real-world data sets 4 THE FRB TEST FOR ICA Based on equation 4 at nite samples the FastICA estimator of demixing vector  w k solves the FP equation  w k  Q   w k  X  where Q   w k  X  1    k    k  1  C  1  m k     k  1  I   k  1 i 1  w i  w  i  C and  m k  E F n  g   w  k x  x   Here a notation of the form E F n  q  x  resp E F  n  q  x    for some function q denotes sample averages over data set x 1    x n resp bootstrap data x  1    x  n  i.e E F n  q  x   1 n  n i 1 q  x i   The one-step estimator as in 2 is now  w 1  k  1    k    k  1   C    1  m  k  5 where  C   E F  n  x  x   is the sample covariance matrix based on the bootstrap sample X    m  k  E F  n  g   w  k x   x   and    k  1  I   k  1 i 1  w R  i   w R  i    C   The FRB estimate is then  w R  k   w k  I   w k Q   w k  X   1   w 1  k   w k   6 Algorithm 1 The FRB test based on FastICA Input  Data set X  FastICA estimate  W based on X  number of bootstrap samples B level  of the test Output  conìdence intervals for a ij  1 Compute the FastICA FRB replicate of demixing matrix  W R    w R  1   w R  d   based on bootstrap sample X  as explained in I-IV 2 If  W R  is close to singular repeat Step 1 3 Compute the bootstrap mixing matrix  A R    W R    1  4 Repeat Steps 1Ö3 until B bootstrap estimates  A R  1   A R  B are formed 5 Construct 100\(1    bootstrap conìdence interval CI Reject H 0 if the CI does not contain 0 where   w k Q   w k  X   1   2 k    k  1  C  1     k I   m k  w  k   M k   m k  m  k  and  M k  E F n  g    w  k x  xx    Note that FRB approach avoids the computation of the FastICA demixing matrix  W  for each bootstrap sample X   instead one needs to proceed as follows I Compute the FRB estimate  w R  k from equation 6 II Orthogonalize  w R  k w.r.t the previously estimated demixing vectors  w R  k     k  1  w R  k  III Normalize the result  w R  k   w R  k  012   w R  k    C   w R  k  IV Perform the above steps for all demixing vectors and construct the FastICA FRB replicate of demixing matrix as  W R    w R  1   w R  d    The procedure for constructing the FRB test of level  for the elements of  A is explained in the Algorithm 1 In step 5 of the algorithm 100\(1    bootstrap conìdence intervals CI can be obtained by percentile method as follows rst the bootstrap values of  a ij are sorted in an increasing order and then L  012 B 2  th and U  B  L  th largest values are taken as the lower and upper limits of the interval respectively where B denotes the number of bootstrap samples 5 EXAMPLE We generate n  1000 samples from the ICA model  x  A s   where the source distributions are as follows s 1 has a Laplace distribution s 2 has a t distribution with 5 degrees of freedom s 3 follows a logistic distribution and source s 4 has a Gaussian distribution All distributions have zero mean and 8

groups to deploy their own versions and allows us to bene\002t from any community improvements to the software VII C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we have provided a case study of CiteSeer 037 and how it integrates data from across the Web and performs automatic extraction clustering entity linking and name disambiguation on that data Furthermore we have described how we share data code and services and some of the challenges and opportunities that have arisen from doing that All of these tasks are interesting in and of themselves from a research perspective however recently we have been faced with the pressure of not only supporting these sorts of operations but also the need to do so in scalable ways In this regard as CiteSeer 037 has continued to grow we have been faced with increasing pressure to be able to deal with the needs and demands of big data and the need to design algorithms systems and processes that are scalable Though not discussed in this paper the 002rst step in doing this has involved migrating CiteSeer 037 from a physical architecture to a virtual architecture This has the main bene\002t of allowing us to provision resources on demand in order to meet increasing requirements for processing power However in addition to this we see a number of other research opportunities in dealing with scholarly big data It was mentioned in Section III that we crawl between 50,000 and 100,000 PDFs per day of which about 40 are scholarly documents however we only ingest about 10,000 new documents per day and thus a bottleneck exists in our ingestion pipeline Research opportunities thus potentially exists in distributed ingestion Opportunities also exist in investigating new information extraction methods that can be applied to scholarly data such as extracting data from 002gures as previously mentioned This is one of the main bene\002ts of automated scholarly big data management systems since new extraction modules can easily be added As already mentioned though there are often errors in extraction thus there is the potential to identify new sources of information that can be integrated into CiteSeer 037 that can be used to improve the quality of automatically extracted data Furthermore the user corrections submitted through MyCiteSeerX provides a useful set of data that can be used to try and better understand where automatic extraction fails which may be bene\002cial for improving the extraction algorithms Lastly given the large number of hits that CiteSeer 037 receives per day we believe that there is an opportunity in analyzing access logs in order to determine how best to provision services and design algorithms For instance logs analysis can be used to gain insight into user requests and requirements improve ranking and determine which data should be cached A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation R EFERENCES  E Archambault D Amyot P  Deschamps A Nicol L Rebout and G Roberge

Ideally, the maximum panel current would be generated so as to meet the EPS 4 requirement by test.  However, the theatre lamp is not that prec ise; slight variations in warm up time, distance, and focus can produce large swings in panel current.  The lab experiments also showed that some cases can generate currents in excess of the design value.  To eliminate risk of hardware damage, the flight t est requires a minimum of 500mA generation, and a target of 80% of the manufacturer\222s LAPSS measurement 7  T hi s va l ue i s l a r ge e no ug h t o e xp o s e a n y  s ub s t a nt i a l  power losses in signal path, and to cause a failed string to clearly result in an out of fami ly measurement  Hardware and Personnel Safety  Thermal 227 In addition to safely de rating the current generation, several safety aspects required resolution prior to the first flight test.  Though the metal halide bulbs better approximate the sunlight spectrum, they still generate infrared.  Both the panel and surrounding flight hardware require real time monitoring to prevent thermal related damage.  Only 40% of th e LADEE panels carry embedded temperature sensors.  To maintain hardware safety, the test requires use of a calibrated, handheld thermal imager.  The specific imager used \(Fluke Ti25\ is essentially an infrared digital camera.  The entire panel can be moni tored and saved for offline analysis.  The test limit for panel temperature is 70\272 Celsius, driven by the mounting bushings.  This proved good for nominal safety measurements, but limited for precision use due to surface reflections  Contamination 227 LADEE is a contamination sensitive mission due to the presence of mass spectrometers and optical instruments.  All spacecraft activities occur in 10k clean tent, and instruments are continuously bagged and purged.  Theatre lamp systems are not necessarily design ed for a clean room environment.  The rental lamps see heavy usage, and often have peeling paint.  New lamps outgas substantially, and must be burned in prior to test in the clean tent     Figure 8:  Test La mp Spectrum  


Optics 227 Though the lamp is, roughly speaking, meant to simulate sunlight spectrum and intensity, most of the optical hardware on the spacecraft is not designed to look directly into the sun.  LADEE\222s body mount panels are r ight next to the payloads; for protection, all instruments were shielded with reflective blankets.  LADEE\222s star trackers can withstand sunlight, and did not require protection  Personnel Safety 227 Regarding personnel safety, precautions were necessary.  On e of the strengths of the metal halide bulb is less infrared and more UV; unfortunately human eyes are sensitive to UV radiation.  Further, the light reflects easily and can cause headaches even when personnel avoid looking at the bulb.  Fortunately, an in expensive, stock solution was available.  Most standard safety glasses meet the ANSI Z87.1 standard for UV protection.  Welding glasses also meet the standard, and often provide fitted wrap around protection.  To meet personnel safety, the project purchased a dozen glasses and required all personnel to wear them during test. [7  D eb r i ef s a n d p l acar d s s er v e t o  notify all staff   5  T EST R ESULTS  The first test occurred just after final observatory integration, and was straightforward to execute.  The test tim e was about four hours, and required three staff to operate.  The EPS 4 295W requirement was not met due to de rating the lamp.  Figures 9 and 10 are time series of all panel currents and temperature sensors during the test Figure 11 shows a typical \221ste p\222 current signature for each panel type.  Note the signature shows evidence that the lamp warm up persists beyond one minute.  All panels measured above the 0.5A requirement, with most between 70 75% of maximum.  Typical panel temperatures hovered around 45\272 Celsius \(Figure 12\, with the hottest at about 59\272 Celsius The test was considered a success, and LADEE Risk #87 was subsequently closed  LADEE project management was sufficiently happy with the test that it approved purchase of a new lamp system The test proved to be simple enough in execution that the test rig could be taken to the launch site for evaluation prior to encapsulation.  At t he final observatory test \(Figure 13 the team attempted verification of the 295W requirement Enough thermal margin was available to relax the generated current de rating from 25% to roughly 10%.  Recall that only one panel can be tested at a time; anal ysis combines superposition of results with the spacecraft rotation and orientation outlined in Figure 3.  The average observatory power generation meets the 295W requirement \(Table 4 Three sides of the spacecraft fell less than 10% short of the require ment.  However, the level of residual risk was considered appropriate for a Class D mission and no further testing was required  Table 4:  EPS 4 Closed by Test  Minimum Power  Maximum Power  Average Power  Requirement  270.9W  339.7W  310.4W  295W     Figure 9:  Solar Array Test Currents

   10   Figure 12:  Infrared Image of a Panel during Test   Figure 13:  Final LADEE Test   6  M AINTENANCE   I NSPECTION   AND R EPAIR  Receiving Inspection  Beyond testing, the LADEE team used tried and true methods of visual inspection and record keeping from receipt through launch.  The panel vendor accompanied the initial delivery of hardware to NASA ARC and participated in an on site inspection, thereby do cumenting the initial state of the hardware.  Throughout during Integration and Test \(I&T\, the LADEE test team performed their own visual inspections of the hardware.  This best practice resulted in the discovery of two panels with minor damage  Launch Site Inspection  Following shipment to the launch facility \(NASA Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia\, the manufacturer performed an on site inspection and repair of the panels.  Roughly 15% of the array was found to have minor cracks and damage due to  handling \(Figure 14\.  During an extended stay at Wallops Island, the repair team was able to fix all affected panels with no issues \(Figure 15\.  The simplicity, portability, and ease of operation of the lamp test fixture made it easy to re evaluate all repaired panels prior to launch.  Note the inspections and final test were not part of the project\222s original \(observatory LAPSS test\ plan   Figure 14:  Damaged LADEE Solar Cell   Figure 15:  Cell Repair at the Launch Facility   7  M ISSION O PERATIONS  A ma jor assumption that enabled the entire risk mitigation process was the allocation of manufacturer\222s per panel LAPSS data for requirements verification, LADEE EPS modeling and mission operations tools.  Several factors can invalidate that assumption.  One obviously, is any damage and repair that could occur prior to launch.  Another is degradation; though LADEE is a short lifetime mission some level of radiation or micro meteorite damage will occur.  A final factor, shadowing, is less a function of the pan els themselves than the spacecraft geometry Protrusions in the spacecraft will tend to shadow portions of the array, and predicting that behavior can be extremely complex.  Neither the lamp test nor a LAPSS would completely account for shadowing.  All of  these factors feed into the need to continuously evaluate the health and performance of the solar array through mission operations  


   11 This would be relatively simple if the spacecraft\222s COTS avionics measured current from each panel, or even each switch.  Unfortunately this is not the case; only one measurement is made for the entire solar array system This design approach, while appropriate for a low complexity Class D system, is highly inconvenient for debugging any type of photovoltaic system failure   During Operational Readiness Training \(ORTs\, the LADEE EPS team developed a method to evaluate panel performance throughout the mission.  The approach illuminates the interdisciplinary nature and value of mission operations experience, even for the hardware designer.  In this case, the ORT campaign engendered collaboration between the EPS and Guidance, Navigation, and Control GNC\ teams that led to a solution.  The EPS team discovered that the GNC system design includes calculation and storage of the spacecraft sun vector as part of its attitude determination process.  As mentioned, the EPS subsystem records the solar array current and number of closed switches.  The EPS analysis tool simply combines the downlinked sun vector with the EPS data and a ge ometrical spacecraft model to determine an expected array current and the derived error \(Figure 16\.  Observation of the spacecraft over a combination of attitudes can be used to back out the behavior of individual panels, thereby updating the manufacture r\222s data   8  C ONCLUSIONS  The LADEE program applied true Class D risk tracking and mitigation techniques to address a major technical risk.  A project decision driven by resources, combined with redefinition of risk metrics, forced its staff to reconsider st andard practices and determine what was really necessary The process of test research development, execution, and risk closure took roughly 10 weeks \(Figure 5\.  The total cost was roughly 12% of the industry standard \(LAPSS solution in materials costs  and 12 labor hours per test Further, the theatre lamp approach is easy to train with and portable.  When combined with standard visual inspection it actually added value over the LAPSS approach in this application.  The test proved the system met powe r generation requirements 6 weeks prior to launch.  Post launch, interdisciplinary approaches proved useful to track performance of the array in flight.  Finally, the entire approach can be easily handed down to future missions   A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work  was performed under the direction of Joseph Camisa, who served as the LADEE EPS Lead until his retirement in mid 2013.  Additional notes of appreciation go to the NASA GSFC Power Group \(Code 563\, the Emcore inspection and repair staff, and the LADEE Syst ems Engineering, Project Management, and Integration and Test teams for their participation in this work        Figure 16 226 Mission Operations Tool Overlays Expected and Actual Generated Array Current
