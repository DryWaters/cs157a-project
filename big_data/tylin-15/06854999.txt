Italy 2 Dpt of Electrical Eng State University of New York SUNY at Buffalo Buffalo NY 14260 USA ABSTRACT We propose a decomposition framework for the parallel optimization of the sum of a differentiable function and a block separable nonsmooth convex one The latter term is typically used to enforce structure in the solution as for example in LASSO problems Our framework is very exible and includes both fully parallel Jacobi schemes and Gauss-Seidel Southwell-type ones as well as virtually all possibilities in between e.g gradientor Newton-type methods with only a subset of variables updated at each iteration Our theoretical convergence results improve on existing ones and numerical results show that the new method compares favorably to existing algorithms Index Terms  Parallel optimization Jacobi method LASSO Sparse solution 1 INTRODUCTION The minimization of the sum of a smooth function F  and of a nonsmooth separable convex one G  min x  X V  x   F  x  G  x   1 is an ubiquitous problem that arises in many elds of engineering so diverse as compressed sensing basis pursuit denoising sensor networks neuroelectromagnetic imaging machine learning data mining sparse logistic regression genomics metereology tensor factorization and completion geophysics and radio astronomy Usually the nonsmooth term is used to promote sparsity of the optimal solution that often corresponds to a parsimonious representation of some phenomenon at hand Many of the mentioned applications can give rise to extremely large problems so that standard optimization techniques are hardly applicable And indeed recent years have witnessed a urry of research activity aimed at developing solution methods that are simple for example based solely on matrix/vector multiplications but yet capable to converge to a good approximate solution in reasonable time It is hardly possible here to even summarize the huge amount of work done in this eld we refer the reader to the recent works 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 as entry points to the literature It is clear however that if one wants to solve really large problems parallel methods exploiting the computational power of multicore processors have to be employed It is then surprising that while serial solutions methods for Problem 1 have been widely investigated the analysis of parallel algorithms suitable to large-scale implementations lags behind Gradient-type methods can of course be easily parallelized However beyond that we are only aware of very few papers all very recent that deal with parallel solution methods 2 6 13 These papers analyze both randomized and deterministic block Coordinate Descent Methods CDMs that essentially are still regularized gradient-based methods One advantage of the analyses in 2 6 13 is that the y pro vide an interesting global rate of convergence On the other hand they apply only to convex  The order of the authors is alphabetic The work of Scutari was

where at each iteration a partial minimization of the original function is performed with respect to a block variable while all other variables are kept xed and the possibility to deal with a nonconvex F  In this paper building on the approach proposed in 20 we present a broad deterministic algorithmic framework for the solution of Problem 1 with the following novel features i it is parallel with a degree of parallelism that can be chosen by the user and that can go from a complete parallelism each variable is updated in parallel to all the others to the sequential one variable only is updated at each iteration ii it can tackle a nonconvex F  iii it is very exible and includes among others updates based on gradientor Newton-type methods and iv it easily allows for inexact solutions Our framework allows us to de“ne different schemes all converging under the same conditions  that can accommodate different problem features and algorithmic requirements Even in the most studied case in which F is convex and G  x   0 our results compare favourably to existing ones and the numerical results show our approach to be very promising 2 PROBLEM DEFINITION We consider Problem 1 where the feasible set X  X 1  X N is a cartesian product of lower dimensional convex sets X i  R n i  and x  R n is partitioned accordingly to x  x 1  x N   with each x i  R n i  F is smooth and not necessarily convex and G is convex and possibly nondifferentiable with G  x   N i 1 g i  x i  with x i  X i  This format is very general and includes problems of great interest Below we list some instances of Problem 1  G  x   in this case the problem reduces to the minimization of a smooth possibly nonconvex problem with convex constraints  F  x   Ax  b  2 and G  x  c  x  1  X  R n  with A  R

3 MAIN RESULTS We want to develop parallel solution methods for Problem 1 whereby operations can be carried out on some or possibly all block variables x i at the same time The most natural parallel Jacobi-type method one can think of is updating all blocks simultaneously given x k  each block variable x k 1 i is computed as the solution of min x i  F  x i  x k  i  g i  x i  where x  i denotes the vector obtained from x by deleting the block x i  Unfortunately this method converges only under very restrictive conditions that are seldom v eri“ed in practice To cope with this issue we introduce some memory and set the new point to be a convex combination of x k and the solutions of min x i  F  x i  x k  i  g i  x i   However our framework has many additional features as discussed next Approximating F  Solving each min x i  F  x i  x k  i  g i  x i  may be too costly or dif“cult in some situations One may then prefer to approximate this problem in some suitable sense in order to facilitate the task of computing the new iteration To this end we assume that for all i N   1 N  we can de“ne a function P i  z  w  X i  X  R having the following properties we denote by  P i the partial gradient of P i with respect to z  P1 P i    w  is convex and continuously differentiable on X i for all w  X  P2  P i  x i  x   x i F  x  for all x  X  P3  P i  z    is Lipschitz continuous on X for all z  X i  Such a function P i should be regarded as a simple convex approximation of F at the point x with respect to the block of variables x i that preserves the rst order properties of F with respect to x i  Based on this approximation we can de“ne at any point x k  X a regularized approximation  h i  x i  x k  of V with respect to x i where F is replaced by P i while the nondifferentiable term is preserved and a quadratic regularization is added to make the overall approximation strongly convex More formally we have  h i  x i  x k   P i  x i  x k   i  2  x i  x k i  T Q i  x k   x i  x k i      h i  x i  x k   g i  x i   where Q i  x k  is an n i  n i positive de“nite matrix possibly dependent on x k   We always assume that the functions h i    x k i  are uniformly strongly convex A6 All h i    x k  are uniformly strongly convex on X i with a common positive de“niteness constant q 0  furthermore Q i    is Lipschitz continuous on X  Note that an easy and standard way to satisfy A6 is to take for any i and for any k   i  q 0 and Q i  x k  I  However if P i    x k  is already uniformly strongly convex one can avoid the proximal term and set  i 0 while satisfying A6 Associated with each i and point x k  X we can de“ne the following optimal solution map 012 x i  x k  i   argmin x i  X i  h i  x i  x k   2 Note that 012 x i  x k  i  is always well-de“ned since the optimization problem in 2 is strongly convex Given 2 we can then introduce X  y   012 x  y      012 x i  y  i  N i 1  The algorithm we are about to described is based on the computation of 012 x  Therefore the approximating functions P i should lead to as easily computable functions 012 x as possible An appropriate choice depends on the problem at hand and on computational requirements We discuss some possible choices for P i after introducing the main algorithm Algorithm 1 see for more details Inexact solutions In many situations especially in the case of large-scale problems it can be useful to further reduce the computational effort needed to solve the subproblems in 2 by allowing inexact computations z k of 012 x i  x k  i   i.e  z k i  012 x i  x k    012  k i  where  k i measures the accuracy in computing the solution Updating only some blocks Another important feature of our algorithmic framework is the possibility of updating only some of the variables at each iteration a feature that has been observed to be very effective numerically In fact our schemes are guaranteed to converge under the update of only a subset of the variables at each iteration the only condition is that such a subset contains at least one block component which is within a factor   0  1 far away from the optimality in the sense explained next First of all x k i is optimal for  h i  x i  x k  if and only if 012 x i  x k  i  x k i  Ideally we would like then to select the indices to update according to the optimality measure d k i   012 x i  x k  i   x k i  e.g opting for blocks exhibiting larger d k i s but in some situations this could be computationally too expensive Building on the same idea we can introduce alternative less expensive metrics based on a computationally cheaper error bound  i.e a function E i  x  such that s i  012 x i  x k  i   x k i 012 E i  x k  012  s i  012 x i  x k  i   x k i   3 for some 0  s i 012  s i  Of course we can always set E i  x k   012 x i  x k  i   x k i   but other choices are also possible we discuss some of them after introducing the algorithm We are now ready to formally introduce our algorithm Algorithm 1 that enjoys all the features discussed above Its convergence properties to stationary solutions 1 of 1 are given in Theorem 1 whose proof is omitted because of space limitation see Algorithm 1 Inexact Parallel

conditions i  k  0  1  ii  k  0  iii  k  k    iv  k   k  2     and v  k i 012  k  1 min   2  1   x i F  x k   for all i N and some nonnegative constants  1 and  2  Additionally if inexact solutions are used in Step 2 i.e  k i  0 for some i and in“nite k  then assume also that G is globally Lipschitz on X  Then either Algorithm 1 converges in a nite number of iterations to a stationary solution of 1 or every limit point of  x k  at least one such points exists is a stationary solution of 1  On Algorithm 1 The proposed algorithm is extremely exible We can always choose S k  N resulting in the simultaneous update 1 We recall that a stationary points x  of 1 is a point for which a subgradient   G  x   exists such that   F  x     T  y  x    0 for all y  X If F is convex stationary points coincide with global minimizers 7209 


of all the block variables full Jacobi scheme or at the other extreme one can update a single block variable per time thus obtaining a Gauss-Southwell kind of method One can also compute inexact solutions Step 2 while preserving convergence provided that the error term  k i and the step-size  k s are chosen according to Theorem 1 We emphasize that the Lipschitzianity of G is required only if 012 x  x k   is not computed exactly for in“nite iterations At any rate this Lipschitz conditions is automatically satis“ed if G is a norm and therefore in LASSO and group LASSO problems for example or if X is bounded On the choice of the stepsize  k  An example of step-size rule satisfying i-iv in Theorem 1 is given  0 1  let  k   k  1  1   k  1  k 1  4 where   0  1 is a given constant see for others rules This is actually the rule we used in our practical experiments cf Sec 4 Note that while this rule may still require some tuning for optimal behaviour it is quite reliable since in general we are not using a sub direction so that many of the well-known practical drawbacks associated with a sub method with diminishing step-size are mitigated in our setting Furthermore this choice of step-size does not require any form of centralized coordination which is a favourable feature in a parallel environment We remark that it is possible to prove convergence of Algorithm 1 also using other step-size rules such as a standard Armijo-like linesearch procedure or a suitably small constant step-size see for more details We omit the discussion of these options because of lack of space but also because the former is not in line with our parallel approach while the latter is numerically less ef“cient On the choice of E i  x    As we mentioned the most obvious choice is to take E i  x   012 x i  x k  i   x k i   This is a valuable choice if the computation of 012 x i  x k  i  can be easily accomplished For instance in the LASSO problem with N   1 n  i.e when each block reduces to a scalar variable it is well-known that 012 x i  x k  i  can be computed in closed form using the soft-thresholding operator  In situations where the computation of  012 x i  x k  i   x k i  is not possible or advisable we can resort to estimates Assume momentarily that G  0  Then it is known 29 Proposition under our assumptions that   X i  x k i  x i F  x k   x k i  is an error bound for the minimization problem in 2 and therefore satis“es 3 where  X i  y  denotes the Euclidean projection of y onto the closed and convex set X i  In this situation we can choose E i  x k    X i  x k i  x i F  x k   x k i  If G  x    0 things become more complex In most cases of practical interest adequate error bounds can be derived from 15 Lemma  It is interesting to note that the computation of E i is only needed if a partial update of the block variables is performed However an option that is always feasible is to take S k  N at each iteration i.e update all block variables at each iteration With this choice we can dispense with the computation of E i altogether On the choice of P i  x i  x    The most obvious choice for P i is the linearization of F at x k with respect to x i  P i  x i  x k  F  x k   x i F  x k  T  x i  x k i   With this choice and taking for simplicity Q i  x k  I  012 x i  x k  i  is given by argmin x i  X i 015 F  x k   x i F  x k  T  x i  x k i   i  2  x i  x k i  2  g i  x i    5 This is essentially the way a new iteration is computed in most sequential block for the solution of group LASSO problems and its generalizations Note that contrary to most existing schemes our algorithm is parallel   Assuming F  x i  x k  i  convex at another extreme we could just take P i  x i  x k  F  x i  x k  i   which setting for simplicity Q i  x k  I leads to 012 x i  x k  i  argmin x i  X i 015 F  x i  x k  i   i 2  x i  x k i  2  g i  x i    6 thus giving rise to a parallel nonlinear Jacobi type method for the constrained minimization of V  x    Between the two extreme solutions proposed above one can consider intermediate choices For example If F  x i  x k  i  is convex we can take P i  x i  x k  as a second order approximation of F  x i  x k  i   i.e P i  x i  x k  F  x k   x i F  x k  T  x i  x k i  1 2  x i  x k i  T  2 x i x i F  x k   x i  x k i   When g i  x i   0  this essentially corresponds to taking a Newton step in minimizing the reduced problem min x i  X i F  x i  x k  i   resulting in 012 x i  x k  i  argmin x i  X i 015 F  x k   x i F  x k  T  x i  x k i   1 2  x i  x k i  T  2 x i x i F  x k   x i  x k i   i 2  x i  x k i  2  g i  x i    The framework described in Algorithm 1 can give rise to very different instances according to the choices one makes for the many variable features it contains some of which have been detailed above For lack of space we cannot fully discuss here all possibilities We provide next just a few instances of possible algorithms that fall in our framework more examples can be found in Example 1  Proximal Jacobi algorithms for convex functions Consider the simplest problem falling in our setting the unconstrained minimization of a continuously differentiable convex function i.e assume in 1 that F is convex G  x   0  and X  R n  Although this is possibly the best studied problem in nonlinear optimization classical parallel methods for this problem 27 Sec require very strong contraction conditions In our framework we can take S k  N  P i  x i  x k  F  x i  x k  i   resulting in a fully parallel Jacobi-type method which does not need any additional assumptions Furthermore our theory shows that we can even dispense with the convexity assumption and still get convergence of a Jacobi-type method to a stationary point Example  2  Parallel coordinate descent method for LASSO Consider the LASSO problem i.e problem 1 with F  x   Ax  b  2  G  x  c  x  1  and X  R n  Probably to date the most succesful class of methods for this problem is that of CDMs whereby at each iteration a single variable is updated using 5 We can easily obtain a parallel version for this method by taking n i 1  S k  N and still using 5 Alternatively instead of linearizing F  x   we can better exploit the convexity of F  x  and use 6 Furthermore we can easily consider similar methods for the group LASSO problem just take n i  1  As a nal remark we observe that convergence conditions of existing deterministic fully distributed parallel versions of CDMs such as 2 impose a constraint on the maximum number of variables that can be simultaneously updated linked to the spectral radius of some matrices a constraint that in many large scale problems is likely not satis“ed A key feature of the proposed scheme is that we can parallelize over possibly all variables while guaranteeing convergence 4 NUMERICAL RESULTS In this section we provide some numerical results providing a solid evidence of the viability of our approach they clearly show that our algorithmic framework leads to practical methods that exploit well 7210 


parallelism and compare favourably to existing schemes both parallel and sequential The tests were carried out on LASSO problems one of the most studied instance of 1 other classes of problems are considered in W e generate four instances of problems using the random generation technique proposed by Nesterov in  this method permits to control the sparsity of the solution For the rst three groups we considered problems with 10,000 variables with the matrix A having 2,000 rows The three groups differ in the number of non zeros of the solution which is 20 low sparsity 10 medium sparsity and 5 high sparsity respectively The last group is an instance with 100,000 variables and 5000 rows and solutions having 5 of non zero variables high sparsity We implemented the instance of Algorithm 1 that we described in Example  2 in the previous section with the only difference that we used 6 instead of the proximal-linear choice 5 Note that in the case of LASSO problems the unique solution 6 can be computed in closed form using the soft-thresholding operator see e.g The free parameters of the algorithm are chosen as follows The proximal parameters are initially set to  i  tr  A T A   2 n for all i  where n is the total number of variables Furthermore we allowed a nite number of possible changes to  i according to the following rules i all  i are doubled if at a certain iteration the objective function does not decrease and ii they are all halved if the objective function decreases for ten consecutive iterations We updated  k according to 4 with  0 0  9 and  1 e  5  Note that since  i are changed only a nite number of times conditions of Theorem 1 are satis“ed and thus this instance of Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to converge Finally we choose not to update all variables but set E i  x k   012 x i  x k  i   x k i  and  0  5 in Algorithm 1 We compared our algorithm above termed FLEXible parallel Algorithm FLEXA with a parallel implementation of FISTA that can be regarded as the benchmark algorithm for LASSO problems and Grock a parallel algorithm proposed in that seems to perform extremely well on sparse problems We actually tested two instances of Grock namely i one where only one variable is updated at each iteration and ii a second instance where the number of variables simultaneously updated is equal to the number of the parallel processors 16 for the rst three set of test problems 32 for the last Note that the theoretical convergence of Grock is in jeopardy as the number of updated variables increases convergence conditions for this method are likely to hold only if the columns of A are almost orthogonal a feature enjoyed by most our test problems but not satis“ed in most applications As benchmark we also implemented two classical sequential schemes i a Gauss-Seidel GS method computing  x i  and then updating x i using unitary step-size in a sequential fashion and ii a classical Alternating Method of Multipliers ADMM in the form of 32 Note that ADMM can be parallelized but it is known not to scale well and therefore we did not consider this possibility here All codes have been written in C and use the Message Passing Interface for parallel operations All algebra is performed by using the GNU Scienti“c Library GSL The algorithms were tested on a cluster computer at the State University of New York at Buffalo All computations were done on one 32 core node composed of four 8 core CPUs with 96GB of RAM and In“niband card The 10,000 variables problems were solved using 16 parallel processes while for the 100,000 variables problems 32 parallel processes were used GS and ADMM were always run on a single process Results of our experiments are reported in Fig 1 where we plot the relative error  V  x k   V   V  versus the CPU time where V  is the optimal value of V  The CPU time includes communication times for distributed algorithms and the initial time needed by the methods to  0 5 10 15 10 4 10 2 10 0      time

computations this explains why the plot of FISTA starts after the others in fact FISTA requires some nontrivial initializations based on the computation of  A  2 2  The curves are averaged over ten random realizations for each of the 10,000 variables groups while for large 100,000 variables problems the average is over 3 realizations Fig 1 shows that on the tested problems FPA outperforms in a consistent manner all other implemented algorithms Sequential methods behave strikingly well on the 10,000 variables problems if one keeps in mind that they only use one process however as expected they cannot compete with parallel methods when the dimensions increase FISTA is capable to approach relatively fast low accuracy solutions but has dif“culties in reaching high accuracies The parallel version of Grock is the closest match to FLEXA but only when the problems are very sparse and the dimensions not too large This is consistent with the fact that at each iteration Grock updates only a very limited number of variables and also with the fact that its convergence properties are at stake when the problems are quite dense Our experiments also suggest that differently from what one could think and often claimed in similar situations when using gradient-like methods updating only a suitably chosen subset of blocks rather than all variables may lead to faster algorithms see for a detailed discussion on this issue In conclusion we believe the results overall indicate that our approach can lead to very ef“cient practical methods for the solution of large problems with the exibility to adapt to many different problem characteristics 5 CONCLUSIONS We proposed a highly parallelizable algorithmic scheme for the minimization of the sum of a differentiable function and a block-separable nonsmooth one Our framework easily allows us to analyze parallel versions of well-known sequential methods and leads to entirely new algorithms When applied to large-scale LASSO problems our algorithm was shown to outperform existing methods 7211

one is more secure than the other. Regardless of the size of the footprint or th e type of architecture, wellwritten and tested kernel code will provide better security. At best, it could be said that they meet different, competing objectives. Microkernel designs have minimal kernels and offer highly customizable management planes. They allow for tailored solutions and simplify the development process Monolithic architectures are preconfigured with necessary drivers and software in the trusted zone They require less domain knowledge to set up and provide fewer options for tampering This analysis will pr ove valuable to both IT professionals and softwa re engineers. Enterprise architects and information security professionals are often forced to make acquisition decisions will less than complete information. This research identified a number of factors to consider before implementing new technologies. However, the present study should not be considered comprehensive. Other design factors should be elicited in future research. This study should also be of interest to software engineers. Often security is considered late in the software development cycle. By analyzing security implications at the architectural level, this research attempts to incorporate security concerns earlier in the design process. Future studies should focus on approaches to compensating for security weaknesses in each type of architecture

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
