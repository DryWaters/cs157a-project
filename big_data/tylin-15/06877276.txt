is structur ed and used The tr end of big data gr o wth pr esents enormous challenges b ut it also pr esents incr edible scienti\002c and b usiness opportunities T ogether with the data explosion we ar e also witnessing a dramatic incr ease in data pr ocessing capabilities thanks to new po werful parallel computer ar chitectur es and mor e sophisticated algorithms In this paper we describe the algorithmic design and the optimization techniques that led to the unpr ecedented pr ocessing rate of 15.3 trillion edges per second on 64 thousand BlueGene  Q nodes that allo wed the in-memory exploration of a petabyte-scale graph in just a few seconds This paper pr o vides insight into our parallelization and optimization techniques W e belie v e that these techniques can be successfully applied to a br oader class of graph algorithms I Intr oduction Ev ery day  we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data—so much that 90 of the data in the w orld today has been created in the last two years alone This data comes from e v erywhere sensors used to g ather climate information posts to social media sites digital pictures and videos purchase transaction records and cell phone GPS signals to name a fe w  E 013 ecti v ely sifting through massi v e data can pro vide nearly limitless opportunities Decoding data can help scientists share information from a single hard-to-\002nd specimen making ne w disco v eries more possible and frequent Understanding big data can yield adv ances in the study of the human brain o 013 ering the prospect perhaps someday soon to be able to help doctors and scientists to 002nd a cure for critical diseases A Big Data and Graph Exploration The nature of big data often consisting of connections relations and interactions among entities frequently lends itself well to graph-based models As a consequence the huge demands on the processing systems translate directly into a rene wed need for e 016 cient and scalable graph algorithms The 002elds in which graphs are pro ving themselv es as a natural modeling abstraction co v er a number of application areas such as biology  transportation comple x engineered systems such as the Internet and po wer grids communication data social netw orks and more generally  v arious forms of relational data The challenges posed by processing huge graphs include b ut are not limited to ho w to store them ho w to k eep up with updates that could ha v e v ery high frequencies ho w to monitor those updates ho w to classify entities and in general ho w to answer queries that ha v e v ery little structure to e xploit for optimization purposes Graph tra v ersals when not a solution in themselv es are often used as basic components of more sophisticated methods F or e xample connected component algorithms  algorithms to calculate centrality measures or heuristic search algorithms such as A   use graph tra v ersal as a b uilding block W ith huge data sets man y of the locality assumptions current architectures are optimized for are not satis\002ed an ymore V ery often the access patterns are irre gular  limiting the bene\002cial e 013 ects of caching or prefetching and there is v ery little computation per byte loaded so that latencies are harder to hide This has consequences both in terms of algorithmic and of architectural design On the softw are side algorithmic design has to include parallelism at all le v els from the pipelining of the indi vidual memory accesses to the data distrib ution on the nodes of a parallel machine On the hardw are side con v

in the Graph 500 While still in its inf anc y  the Graph 500 captures man y essential features of data intensi v e applications and has raised a lot of interest in the supercomputing community at lar ge both from the scienti\002c and operational point of vie w in f act man y supercomputer procurements are no w including the Graph 500 in their collection of benchmarks In detail the benchmark is speci\002ed by the follo wing steps 1 a graph must be created using a random Kroneck er generator with gi v en coe 016 cients The size of the graph is speci\002ed by the SCALE parameter the graph has 2 S C A L E v ertices and 16 001 2 S C A L E edges The edge is represented as a set of tuples each representing one edge 2 The implementation is free to redistrib ute the edges across the nodes and to represent the graph in an y suitable w ay  The time tak en to con v ert the graph to the implementationdependent representation is measured and is part of the benchmark output 3 The implementation has to perform a number of BFS e xplorations of the graph each time starting from a di 013 erent source v erte x The duration of each e xploration has to be measured and the generated spanning tree has to be v alidated Giv en the number of undirected edges e xplored and the time tak en by the e xploration each iteration gi v es a TEPS rate At the end the metric according to which the systems are rank ed is the harmonic mean of the TEPS across all the e xplorations II Algorithms A Pr eliminaries W e consider a breadth-\002rst search on an unw eighted and undirected graph G   V  E  V is the set of v

ollo wing the Graph500 speci\002cations we represent the spanning tree as a predecessor map P  containing the predecessor P  v  of each v 2 V  W e adopt the con v entions of assigning its o wn self as the predecessor of the root i.e P  v s   v s  and assigning no predecessor at all to the v ertices that cannot be reached from v s  Finally  we de\002ne the le v el of a v erte x as its distance from the root in the spanning tree Algorithm 1 outlines a sequential BFS implementation The visit proceeds in steps e xamining one BFS le v el at a time It uses three sets of v ertices to k eep track of the state of the visit I n contains the v ertices that are being e xplored at the current le v el this set is usually referred to as the fr ontier of the e xploration Out the ones that can be reached from I n  and V i s the ones reached so f ar  In their initial state lines 1–3 the sets I n and V i s only contain v s  and P  v s  is set to the root itself The loop at line 5 is e x ecuted once for

approaches are 1D and 2D decompositions 1 1D Decomposition In a 1D decomposition the v ertices are partitioned among the m nodes n 0      n m 000 1 in the system The edges incident on the v ertices assigned to a node n i are all stored on n i  and visiting an edge  u  v  in v olv es the cooperation and communication between the o wners of u and v  which are in general di 013 erent The adjacenc y

Much of the w ork on lar ge distrib uted systems has been based on 2D decompositions The y were introduced in  where the authors also gi v e a comparison between 1D and 2D partitioning Other w orks using 2D partitioning include the results on BlueGene  L described in  and the already mentioned  One of the problems with using a 2D decomposition is that the representation may become h ypersparse i.e there may be nodes with more edges assigned than v ertices In  as part of their w ork on sparse linear algebra the authors introduce a compression scheme suitable for dealing with the issue Another line of research has focused on single-node system shared memory graph algorithms using CPUs as in the case of   or man ycore architectures lik e   W e mak e e xtensi v e use of bitmaps to
