Abstract 
Taiwanês invoice system is unique in the world in the sense that every invoice must follow the same printed format speciìed by the government In addition an accompanying lottery-like mechanism is implemented to give prizes to some invoice holders periodically as an incentive for citizens to request invoices upon transaction This allows government to audit business sales and has proven quite effective in curbing taxrelated exploitations and boost tax income To increase processing efìciency as well as to reduce paper consumption the Taiwanese government began its e-invoicing project in the early 2000ês The rst generation e-invoicing system targeted B2B and online B2C transactions which accounted for only a very small portion of all invoices issued The second generation initiated in 2010 aimed to promote e-invoices to 
all physical retail chains In this paper we survey Taiwanês einvoicing system and assess its effects and obstacles 
I I NTRODUCTION Taiwanês System was enacted in the 1950s to prevent businesses evading taxation through fraudulent bookkeeping and veriìcation processes It used a standardized procedure to record monetary transactions so as to unify accounting principles and effectively control government tax sources The system was unique in the world in the sense that all invoices must follow the same printed format thus the name uniform Each invoice 1 records the date the item and the amount of a transaction In addition each invoice also records the sellerês ID which was assigned by the government when a 
Uniform Invoice UI 
company registered its name and business to the government Every company must register in Taiwan The seller IDs allow the government to trace transactions so as to collect taxes from sellers One possible way to evade the system by sellers is to give buyers some discount if the buyers do not request an invoice of a transaction As such sellers could forge their transaction records to minimize proìts so as to evade taxes It is especially difìcult to verify a transaction if it occurs at the end of a value chain as the buyer usually does not need to report the transaction for taxing purpose To incentivize buyers to request copies of invoices an accompanying lottery mechanism was implemented to give large cash prizes to some invoice holders periodically It was reported that tax income increased 75 a 
year after the UI system was enacted 1 To be precise an 
invoice receipt uniform invoice uniform receipt 
in general is like a bill requesting for payment for goods or services while a is a proof of the payment In this regard Taiwanês should be called  However since the term has been used for decades we follow the usage and treat receipt as invoice throughout the paper Since the UI system was enacted in the 1950s numerous revisions were made in response to the changing economy and in particular the evolving technology The rst major revision of the UI system was the adoption of Point of Sales 
POS systems in the 1980s which allowed invoices to be electronically printed instead of handwritten Cash registers could then automatically produce invoices upon transaction which in turn reduced human errors and unreported transactions Still printed invoices were required for companies to report their sales to the government Paper-based invoices did not begin to fade away until the implementation of the rst generation e-invoicing system in 2006 where an ofìcial e-invoicing platform was built for businesses to create transfer exchange and/or store e-invoices The rst generation e-invoicing system targeted mainly on business-to-business B2B and online transactions which accounted for less than 4 of all invoices issued in Taiwan The second generation e-invoicing system was initiated in 2010 aiming to promote e-invoices to all 
physical stores and channels along with an ultimate goal to build a more efìcient and environment-friendly invoice system for tax auditing In this paper we survey how the Taiwanês e-invoicing system came to be and assess its effects and possible obstacles We also compare its motivation and approach with other einvoicing efforts in the world Looking at these similarities and differences help understand what the universal goals of e-invoicing are and how speciìc needs change governmentês policies in implementing the system Speciìcally we ask the following research questions 
Why and how should the government promote e-invoice What are the key problems that must be addressed when implementing a national e-invoice system II M

the analysis is not conìned to a certain viewpoint multiple perspectives including consumer business and government are investigated Employing established theories or models can further enhance the reliability of interpretations Lastly we develop recommendations to problems and imply further areas of research Advantages of e-invoicing are recognized by many countries around the globe and various efforts have been made to implement such systems Common appeals or goals include but not limit to the following 5 20 23 Environment-friendly reducing on paper consumption for traditional invoices in turn reducing carbon footprint Operation cost eliminating the need to print transport and other manual labor Business efìciency faster veriìcation and auditing processes Authenticity and integrity enhancing information security Tax compliance reducing tax-related exploitations The difìculty of successfully implementing e-invoice is comparable to implementing an information system thus the study into e-invoice implementation and its success factors are interesting topics This is a relatively new eld of research Case studies that assess experiences of pioneering countries in e-invoicing exist but the diversity of which is still limited to countries that are in an advanced stage A few countries in the EU such as Finland and Denmark are leading the movement and more research is done on their behalf In Latin America several countries such as Mexico and Brazil are actively promoting e-invoice Analyses on these efforts will be explained in Section V Another kind of study focuses on the factors behind adoption of e-invoice Some are included in case studies whereas others attempt to generalize and develop theories/models Next we will rst give an overview of selected related theories/models To assess the effectiveness of an e-invoice implementation many methods of measurement are possible such as amount of cost savings reduced paper consumption or adoption rate In this paper we focus on adoption rate as the major benchmark since its value has direct impact on many other measures The volume of money involved is also a valid measure but is dependent on the party involved e.g business vs consumer This is especially true in the B2C sector as a higher adoption rate means e-invoicing has diffused into a larger portion of population To investigate factors leading to high or low adoption rate one may refer to the Diffusion of Innovations theory by Everett M Rogers W e may apply Rogers theory on e-invoicing since it can be considered as an innovation in application of information technology in business process in electronic service etc The perceived attributes of innovation described by the theory determine the speed of adoption They are relative advantage compatibility complexity trialability and observability Relative advantage refers to the degree of perceived superiority of a new innovation versus the current situation Compatibility can be understood as how a new innovation ts the existing values past experiences and needs Complexity is the perceived level of difìculty to understand or use a new innovation Trialability allows a user to try a new innovation before adoption and observability determines whether a potential user can observe the innovation and be encouraged to adopt it High measures in all ve attributes except complexity low imply faster adoption With e-invoicing it seems reasonable to expect a higher adoption rate if it promises beneìts compatibility with existing processes low technological barrier high trialability and visibility to its implementation There are doubts however that this theory while suited to studies concerning adoption of information systems is applicable to electronic data exchange e.g einvoice One aspect Diffusion of Innovations theory misses is the inîuence of factors external to the innovation and the adopter The Technology Acceptance Model addresses this suggesting that external variables have inîuence over perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use which both in turn affect the actual adoption Nevertheless with technology such as einvoice it is observed that adoption may not be a clear-cut yes or no but a partial one According to a consumer does not necessarily accept e-invoice from all issuers automatically after accepting from just one The research points out that implementation intention speciìc plans of how when and where to execute intended behavior is an important factor to sequential adoption of consumer Aside focusing on businesses and consumers governmental intervention should also be brought into consideration In it is found that targeting companies that do business with the government rst can help create a ripple effect among their suppliers to adopt e-invoice An overarching model that explains e-invoice adoption on a governmental level is proposed by Kreuzer et al The model is a cate gorization of many factors affecting e-invoice implementation and adoption extracted from numerous articles These articles are selected from research databases using the search term electronic invoicing Adding expert reviews as further data sources eight factors are then identiìed institutional pressure ecological pressure political commitment technological readiness economic beneìts educational shortcomings legal uncertainties and social affordances Institutional pressure can be summarized as the need to change due to competition coercion or professionalization Educational shortcomings are about the adverse effects of poor training on e-invoice adoption Social affordances focus on the notion of trust to electronic services such as e-invoice For detailed information please refer to the original paper Kreuzer et al.ês model encompasses a large spectrum of adoption factors speciìc to e-invoice On a governmental level this model is useful in our case study on Taiwanese e-invoice which is ttingly an analysis of government policy-making Although the model targets the governmental level its data sources are diverse enough to include private sectors and citizens Thus the implications derived may also be valid for business and consumer We shall broaden the modelês target to a national level in order to study the factors impacts on the many aspects of e-invoice adoption

III A N O VERVIEW OF T AIWAN  SE I NVOICING S YSTEM In the early years of Taiwanese government taxation laws were yet mature and accounting processes were manual With no standardized principles to regulate bookkeeping was frequently fraudulent and veriìcation could be carried out by corrupt government auditors Taxation based on turnover thus was problematic due to underreported income In an attempt to remedy the problem Finance Chief Jen Hsien-Qun conceptualized the Uniform Invoices in 1950 The core ideology of the uniform invoices preserves even after numerous rounds of revisions For example all printed invoices must follow the formats speciìed by the government Until 1990s all blank invoices were provided by the government to prevent forgery Although several companies have been granted to print blank invoices the Printing Plant of the Ministry of Finance still issues around 40 million books or more than 10 billion sheets of blank invoices each year and has a revenue of approximately NT$146 million 2 from just selling invoices in 2012 Each invoice must record the seller and the date item and amount of the transaction The sellerês information is represented by its Uniform Serial Number USN a unique identiìcation number that every listed business organization must apply for to represent them In addition there is an alphanumeric code known as the Uniform Invoice Number UIN The code is divided into a 2-leading-alphabet part and an 8-digit serial number The alphabet part is used to distinguish types of invoices and their issuing period while the numeric part is used to distinguish individual transactions Given its xed length the same UIN may reoccur every 3 or 4 years Nevertheless invoices with identical UIN can be differentiated by the issuance period The design of the UIN is largely linked to a mechanism that incentivizes people to request a copy of invoice upon transaction To see this observe that a transaction incurs mainly two types of taxes business income tax and business sales tax The former depends on gross annual revenue minus deductible expenses while the latter is taxed per transaction usually on the retail sales of goods such as the value-added tax VAT If buyers do not request invoices a company may forge its transaction records to minimize its income and thus its tax payment It is also possible to exploit this loophole by falsifying expenses to reduce income tax liability Indeed some unworthy sellers did offer buyers a tax 3 waiver if the buyers did not request a copy of invoice To curb tax fraud an accompanying system called the was also introduced in 1950 The lottery randomly draws a set of numbers periodically now bimonthly Anyone who holds an invoice with an 8-digit numeric part of the UIN that matches the drawn numbers can claim a cash prize 4 The prize is considered quite generous by 2 The currency exchange rate is around US$1 to NT$29 at present 3 Currently Taiwanês value-added tax VAT is 5 4 To prevent fraud all UINs are distributed by the government and unused UINs in a given period must be recalled the public For example before Mar 2011 the highest prize was NT$2,000,000 and the new prizing mechanism effective on Mar 25 2011 has increased it to NT$10,000,000 An estimated 8 winners of the prize will be claimed per 2-month drawing period To increase the winning odds any UIN that matches up to certain digits of the drawn numbers can also claim a prize For example a match of the last three digits of a drawn numbers can claim the smallest prize NT$200 with an estimated 3.66 million winners per drawing period Currently there are 5 drawn numbers of various prizes per period 5 The maximum overall winning odds is around 0.30.4 By la w 30 the Ministry of Finance can allocate 3 of collected business tax to the UI Lottery prizes A budget of NT$8.88 billion has been allocated in the 2012 scal year This high prize and high winning odds have effectively attracted people to request copies of invoices which then forced businesses to truthfully record sales and thus boosted the governmentês tax income For example when the uniform invoices system was enacted tax income was boosted to NT$51 million in the rst year 1951 alone a 75 increase than the previous yearês NT$29 million The ne w prizing mechanism effected on 2011.03.25 that increased the rst prize from NT$2,000,000 to NT$10,000,000 also boosted a 8 increase of the amount of invoices issued The electronization of uniform invoices can be dated back to the 1980s where uniform invoices can be electronically processed and printed by cash registers due to the popularization of Point-Of-Sale POS systems However exchange and transmit of invoices were still manually based and done via printed hardcopies Hundreds of workers were employed by the government to key in millions of invoices per month so as to process and verify them electronically within the governmentês information systems It was not until the decree of Provisional Operation Guidelines for Transmitting Uniform Invoices via the Internet in Nov 29 2000 did the government start to pilot e-invoicing in Taiwan The initial target focused on B2B transactions as during that time Taiwanês IT industries were building enterprise resource planning ERP systems to integrate their supply chains The e-invoicing project was subsequently expanded in 2005 to include its coverage on online B2C transactions On Dec 6th 2006 the e-invoice platform opened for operations formally announcing the beginning of paperless invoicing Businesses can use the platform to create transfer exchange or store e-invoices At this stage only B2B and virtual B2C channels utilized e-invoices which accounted for less than 4 of all invoices issued during the year 2009 The Ministry of Finance therefore initiated a three-year project entitled Comprehensive Promotion of the e-Invoice Application Project in May 2010 to promote e-invoices to all physical stores and channels The project also planed to build a new generation of e-invoicing system to cope with the unprecedented volume of invoice data using emerging technology such as cloud computing 5 See

The second generation e-invoicing system circles around the e-invoice platform 6  which houses all hardware and software services to enable the creation transfer exchange storage and processing of e-invoices Based on its usage the system can be described from two perspectives B2C and B2B The life cycle of a B2C e-invoice is depicted in Fig 1 There are several ways for a customer to engage in the platform For ease of understanding similar actions will be labeled the same number or alphabet From a customerês standpoint s/he should register 1 in the gure with the e-invoice platform to create a proìle that includes citizenship information such as name national ID number bank account etc Once done the customer can import 2 his e-invoice carriers into his account so that the platform knows whom these carriers belong to Conceptually an or simply a  is an identiìable container for carrying e-invoices but in essence it is just an identiìcation that is used to associate e-invoice data to an entity For instance loyalty or membership card can be used as a carrier During a transaction at a POS counter if a customer presents his card and requests an e-invoice 3 a binding of the einvoice to the card holder can be established A so that the customer may use the card to inquire 4 the e-invoice later on The e-invoice is also uploaded to the businessês information system and to the e-invoice platform B for storage and processing The customer may also present his card at the POS counter to check if he has won the UI Lottery or be informed automatically by the system next time when he presents the card 5 Registration carrier import and e-invoice inquiry can also be done at a kiosk which is commonly available in most retail chain stores in Taiwan Should a customer win the UI Lottery he can use his carrier to claim the prize and perform fund transfer to a delegated bank account or convert the prize as store credits in his loyalty/membership card 6 Performing this task at a portal of the e-invoice platform at a POS counter or at a kiosk saves the customer a trip to the national post ofìce to claim a lottery prize via a printed invoice copy A customer can also conìgure his proìle in the e-invoice platform for automatic notiìcation of any UI Lottery winning e-invoice and the subsequent prizes transfer to a delegated bank account Because each invoice has a potential to win a cash prize in the UI Lottery many customers simply donate invoices to philanthropic organizations 7 Traditionally there is often a box at the cashier counter that collects customers invoices Each organization has its own box to collect invoices Due to space limitation however only one or two boxes can be placed at each store so not many philanthropic organizations may beneìt from invoice donations With e-invoices each organization can apply for a universal carrier dubbed Love and Care serial code The serial code can be requested or presented by a customer and then scanned at the cashier counter to transfer an e-invoice to the corresponding organization A customer may also donate his e-invoices to an organization at a kiosk 7 6 https://www.einvoice.nat.gov.tw/wSite/dp?mp=2 7 On average about 3 of all issued invoices are donated suggesting that an equal percentage of lottery prizes will go to charity or through the e-invoice platform Therefore the technology evolution also helps philanthropic organizations raise their funds through invoice donations The e-invoice platform also has a pivotal role in B2B transactions For companies with ERP systems they need to connect their systems to the platform through given software dubbed AP2AP Gateway Turnkey 2 Through T urnk e y  in v oice data are uploaded to the platform as shown in Fig 2 During a transaction the buyer must present his USN for the seller to create an invoice which is either stored on a carrier or if requested printed on paper Either way a copy of the data is uploaded to the platform and then classiìed according to USNs The two parties then begin verifying the transaction with information retrieved from the platform through the gateway Both will report sales and the resulting taxes to the Financial Data Center recently renamed to Fiscal Information Agency which is responsible for auditing and cross-checking Information will then be passed on to the National Tax Administration which searches for anomalies and provides access to veriìcation results Fig 2 B2B Flow IV A SSESSMENT In this section we assess Taiwanês e-invoicing service and discuss possible obstacles from the perspectives of three different parties consumers businesses and the government The second generation e-invoice system has put much effort in getting the publicês attention and in persuading them to adopt e-invoices Convenience is a major appeal and the UI Lottery process would be the most appropriate example With paper invoices people have to keep stacks of receipts typically hundreds of invoices per household until the bimonthly lottery and then manually match each UIN against the winning ones To further complicate the process there is not just one winning number but ve and a match of the last three to seven digits of some of the winning numbers can also claim a small prize People either have to manually check each invoice against the winning numbers or to give up the potential prize Besides prizes must be claimed within three months and with a physical copy of the receipt As people sometimes misplace their receipts or even have lost them it is not surprising to

The concept of carrier is crucial to paperless B2C transactions see Section III-D1 as there is typically no buyer\220s identi\223cation in a B2C transaction invoice so a carrier is needed to determine the ownership of the e-invoice At 223rst thought a unique and universal carrier for each consumer might be an appealing solution as then a consumer would be able to use the carrier to collect all his e-invoices in every store and manage them accordingly Several nontrivial problems arise however For example given the potential huge pro\223t in operating the universal carriers it would be considerably dif\223cult to conciliate the opinions of which organization should have the authority to issue the carriers Besides the universal carriers may also appear to be redundant if some other cards membership loyalty storedvalue etc are already used in shopping The stores would also need to spend extra IT cost to integrate the universal carriers into their information systems Security and privacy is also a concern as the lost of such carriers may expose a consumer\220s all purchase records As a result the e-invoicing platform has opened the speci\223cation of carriers and allowed each store to issue their own carriers On the other hand the variety of carriers could also mean 
Fig 1 B2C Data Flow learn that in between Sept 2008 to Dec 2010 137 Grand Prizes were unclaimed with an amount exceeding NT$274 million All the unclaimed prizes go to the national treasury In contrast with the new e-invoice platform UIN matching becomes automatic People may also opt for an automatic fund transfer to a bank account or use a certi\223ed printed copy to pick up the cash in an old-fashioned way i.e post of\223ce The platform can also provide services for registered users to monitor personal expenditures and help in accounting as well as to track family spending and verify purchase details Although the above bene\223ts sound appealing they may not be enough to attract most consumers to adopt e-invoices In fact on average over 8 billion paper invoices were produced per year and almost all were B2C invoices there were only 300 to 400 million B2B invoices However the total amount of B2C e-invoices produced in 2011 only summed up to around 194 million Moreover according to internal information even though the number of B2C e-invoices in between 2012.01-2012.09 has reached 1.5 billion but only 5 of them are issued through carriers According to an empirical study sponsored by the Taiwanese government the lo w carrier adoption rate may generally be attributed to two issues acceptance of e-invoice carriers and security and privacy concerns Below we address them in more detail 
1 Acceptance of e-Invoice Carriers 
2204 


chaos First a consumer must apply for a storeês membership card According to the Personal Information Protection Act each store must also obtain permission from their consumers if they will collect their customers e-invoices It is virtually impossible to use one storeês carrier at another store unless they belong to the same company yet it is hectic if a consumer has to apply for a membership card for every store he shops and carry them around Promoting a widely used card to be a carrier might help resolve the chaos The Taiwanese government therefore proposed the concept of General Carriers which is simply an 8-character serial code generated from a cellular phone number Anyone with a cellular phone along with an email address can apply for a general carrier from the e-invoice platform The serial code is presented as a bar code that can be scanned at a POS counter so as to bind an e-invoice to the serial code as well as to retrieve e-invoices associated with the code The concept was proposed to allow one to use a single carrier that most POS systems can read to collect e-invoices yet still has the possibility of possessing several different such carriers to avoid from being tracked using a single universal carrier This is because each general carrier is tied to a cell phone number and an email address so one may apply a number of general carriers Convenience and security/privacy often conîict with each other This is also the case in einvoicing An obvious security concern is on the carriers as they are used to collect e-invoices The problem is especially crucial for the type of universal carriers that aim to link all transaction records of a customer to a single identiìcation A lost or stolen of such carriers could result in a total exposure of a customerês purchase history Thus extra security mechanisms must be enforced to protect userês e-invoices when the carriers are lost The barcode-like general carriers have an additional passcode for a user to access his e-invoices in the platform so that the exposure of the barcode does not pose any threat to the e-invoices data it links to For carriers issued by stores e.g membership and loyalty cards the stores must have a security mechanism to manage the carriers and to protect the e-invoice data in their databases The e-invoice platform is another security focus Due to its role the platformês information security level has been set to grade-A by the National Security Council of Taiwan meaning that it must meet the highest information security management standard of the government The platform indeed has implemented many layers of information security modules to meet the standard The accompanying UI Lottery has also implemented several mechanisms to enhance its security For example to prevent duplicate invoice prints to claim a winning prize as well as to authenticate an e-invoice print a QR Code is printed on a paper copy to ensure that only the owner has the authentic copy to claim a UI Lottery prize Although the tight security measures suggest that consumerês private information is well protected consumers may not be conìdent with the fact that their purchase records are kept somewhere and may be used by other people someday Thus consumers might end up abandoning carriers or opting for more anonymous solutions Indeed past researches 31 32 43 44 ha v e shown that consumers are not always open to share information with websites for fearing that private data may be tracked and analyzed by unknown parties They do realize that some information is required for better services and experiences but at the same time they want to know how and where this information will go If a company has a clear and acceptable privacy policy and with a good reputation then consumers are more willing to provide information Namely trust can be considered as the ultimate factor that determines consumers willingness to share information with businesses or in the case of Taiwanês e-invoices the government For businesses they not only need to enforce standard privacy policies but must also give consumers more freedom in choosing what information to share The go v ernment does not ha v e such option for e-invoices hence top ofìcials must build trust by showing active commitment and support The concept of data carriers introduces a new technology to consumers that greatly affects purchase patterns Consumers not only face a large number of choices of carriers creating complexity in understanding system they also have to accept the incompatibility among them In Kreuzer et al.ês model these factors fall into the technological category On the other hand in the social category consumers are concerned with security and privacy of data Besides strengthening information security an element of trust is required These two categories of factors overpower the economical and ecological beneìts of e-invoice and thus are of prime importance E-invoicing in Taiwan emerged in 2000 much earlier than the formal enactment of the rst generation e-invoice system in 2006 By 2005 over half of Taiwanês businesses have implemented ERP or MIS systems meaning that most of them were conducting e-business and were ready to use e-invoices E-invoices let these companies get rid of paper invoices which in turn helps speed up transactions and reduce processing cost as well as human errors An approximate 50 cost reduction in invoice processing had been recorded The companies that have implemented ERP systems were mostly large companies in the IT sector Their adoptions of e-invoices could push e-invoices upward to their supply chains thus causing a ripple effect to increase the penetration However around three-quarters of the businesses in Taiwan were not yet willing to adopt e-invoices mainly due to incompatibility with upstream or downstream companies which were still issuing invoices in the traditional way Se v eral other dissuasive factors existed such as incomplete government policies at that time For example directives were given but lacked implementation procedures compensation plans compulsive laws etc Cost-effectiveness were also a concern for smaller businesses since the cost of implementation and training might outweigh any beneìt if they did not issue many invoices per year In the online B2C sector even though e-invoices were not used until 2006 concerns similar to B2B businesses still existed According to the policies back then only a handful of companies were eligible to use e-invoices due to restrictions on minimum revenue and an NT 3 million bond of guarantee for using the e-invoicing system Moreo v er

most businesses needed time to examine e-invoicingês costeffectiveness Consumerês acceptance of e-invoices was also a crucial factor with convenience being the top concern For example consumers still preferred to have a paper invoice as proof of purchase for returning goods and for checking the UI Lottery winning numbers As such paper invoices were still delivered along with packages Similar situation existed for TV shopping industry In short due to the fact that e-invoices could not instantly replace traditional paper invoices businesses must have the ability to issue both paper and paperless e-invoices which turned out to be quite a cumbersome procedure to them In hope to further encourage businesses to use e-invoice the government thus urged physical retail chains to join einvoicing to rapidly increase the penetration rate among their buyers and suppliers Three large retail chains pioneered the movement in 2010 New updates in tool also aimed to solve technological problems that dissuade adoption For example the second version of the Turnkey software provides higher compatibility and better features as described in Section  Multiple instances of the software can now run in parallel to speed up processing The new Turnkey not only supports more operating systems but also more types of databases making integration into existing MIS easier There are many improvements on efìciency and security as well The e-invoice platform has received many feature upgrades over the years such as a better UIN distribution system Businesses can apply for a range of UIN numbers on the platform bimonthly and use them directly on e-invoices A softwarebased certiìcate generation tool is also released to allo w businesses to acquire certiìcates online to authenticate invoice upload In contrast before the release of the tool businesses must apply for an IC card from the MOEACA Ministry of Economy Affairs Certiìcate Authority and use a card reader to read the certiìcate in the IC card to authenticate e-invoices In terms of Kreuzer et al.ês model we again see institutional pressure a crucial factor in e-invoice adoption Without competitors or partners adoption of e-invoice businesses feel less pressure to follow suit since there is no fear of losing competitive advantages such as economical ecological beneìts The Taiwanese government plans to overcome the inertia by targeting businesses that affect the largest population possible Apparently educating the consumers will aid in the adoption process Legal uncertainties in the early stages have hindered progress of adoption but as policies mature businesses should feel more at ease Since the birth of e-invoiceês concept in 2000 Taiwanese government had gone through a number of iterations to complete the complex project The result is a more accurate database of transactions in Taiwan which allows the government to curb fraudulently issued invoices and have better control over tax sources Although there is no ofìcial data to show e-invoiceês effect on Taiwanese governmentês tax income results from other countries may provide some clue For example Argentinaês e-invoice movement showed a 15 decrease in VAT breach since 2002 to 2007 The reduction in VAT breach would not be possible without a wide adoption of e-invoices However as previously described reports dating back to the rst generation e-invoice system had shown that adoption rate was always an issue The Taiwanese government has taken several actions to improve the adoption rate For example it has lifted restrictions such as the aforementioned guaranteed bond for companies joining the einvoicing system Businesses are now automatically eligible to use e-invoices once they receive business permits no extra registration is required Aside from businesses with extensive supply chains the government has urged state enterprises to use e-invoices due to their large inîuences over many industries The Taiwanese government has put much effort in promoting e-invoices for businesses but limited attention in B2G transactions As long as the government continues to perform auditing and veriìcation of its expenses by paper e-invoices would appear to be redundant Policy changes in accounting and auditing laws are thus crucial In this regard on Aug 3 2012 amendments for a law on business-related tax collection 8 have been announced These changes speciìcally addressed e-invoices such as allowing e-invoices to legally replace traditional paper invoices in certain procedures In short constructing a fully digitized tax-related process and environment is the last mile for e-invoicing but is the rst step for a new wave of tax reforms Aside from economical and ecological beneìts a committed strategy to enable e-government drives the political aspect of e-invoicing Policies to lift legal restrictions and reduce technological barriers are all parts of this strategy However as we can see from previous sections governmental intervention in other factors are also indispensable V C OMPARISON WITH O THER EINVOICING E FFORTS Similar to other countries that decide to adopt e-invoice Taiwanês implementation follows the same reasons as outlined in section II Nevertheless across the globe different focuses on e-invoicing can be observed For example in Asia countrywide projects were launched by tax authorities mainly for the purpose of eradicating tax evasion through better validation and auditing mechanisms A number of countries in Latin America share the same mission but with only stricter regulations In contrast European Unionês e-invoicing is enabled by many e-invoicing service providers that comply with a myriad of legislations In this section we explore similarities and differences caused by requirements that may be speciìc to a certain region or country We select the European Union and Latin America for analysis due to that leading countries in e-invoicing are concentrated in these two regions Following a brief description for each region Finland and Brazil will be selected for a more detailed look and compared with Taiwanês e-invoice since they have long experiences and advanced implementations In 2001 the European Commission issued the EC Directive on Invoicing 2001/115/EC hereon referred to as E-invoicing 8 Regulations for the Management of Proìt-Seeking Enterprise Account Books and Receipts by Tax Collection Agencies

Directive as an amendment to the existing rules on VAT invoicing to provide a universal standard for invoice content and to enable e-invoicing However the directives were written in a way that resembles a compromise among many regulations Depending on the government member states could arrive at various levels of compliance Similarities did exist such as the use of EDI but for most the differences created inefìciencies in both domestic and cross-border transactions F or instance there was no clear standard for invoice storage data format and transfer protocols 35 One of the major conîicts concerns how the authenticity and integrity of e-invoice could be guaranteed The E-invoicing Directive stated that the authenticity of origin and integrity of content of invoices should be guaranteed by advanced electronic signature AES or EDI It was also stated that countries could opt for AES based on a qualiìed certiìcate and created by a secure-signature-creation device This type of AES was coined Qualiìed Electronic Signature QES and could be considered as a high-level requirement In contrast a low-level requirement accepted any other electronic means subject to acceptance by the member state\(s Due to such differences companies based in countries with high-level requirements might not accept invoices from those of lower levels and vice versa As a result most countries came up with their own einvoicing implementations with Northern European countries such as Denmark and Finland leading the trend Denmark abolished paper invoices in 2005 and required all invoices to follow a particular format called OIOXML electronic invoice which was based on the OASIS 9 standard Universal Business Language In Finland banks launched Fin v oice which used an XML syntax named ebXML a joint effort by OASIS and UN/CEFACT 10  to format invoices Nevertheless when the European Commission incorporated the E-invoicing Directive into the VAT Directive 2006/112/EC disharmony persisted W ith recommendations from b usinesses and e xpert study groups in mind the Second Directive on VAT Invoicing 2010/45/EU was adopted on Jul 13 2010 The legislation aimed to further remove burdens and barriers will be in effect on Jan 1 2013 Several issues were clariìed such as Article 219a that describes which member stateês invoicing rules to apply during a crossborder transaction Efforts to consolidate the massive matrix of implementations were also constantly made An expert group launched by the European Committee developed the European Electronic Invoicing Framework EEIF to combat fragmentation and improve interoperability across Europe Another ongoing project named PEPPOL 11 also aims to align business processes and expand connectivity of businesses in Europe Instead of competing for mark et share collaboration between the government and service providers is preferred to create a more uniìed Europe The Finnish Bankers Association FBA originally developed Finvoice which is now maintained by The Federation 9 Organization for the Advancement of Structure Information Standards http://www.oasis-open.org 10 United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business 11 Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line of Finnish Financial Services FFFS Finvoice is a popular choice for e-invoicing in Finland due to the banks full support and resulting advantages in using their online services It has gone through several revisions and is now in version 2.0 The Finvoice le format coded in ebXML syntax is an envelope le that contains a header or XML-Transmission frame that describes the sender and receiver and the actual invoice data The XML elements are deìned in Finvoice Implementation Guidelines published by the FFFS similar to Taiwanês MIG To use Finvoice users must sign an agreement with their service providers to use the forwarding service Namely e-invoices are routed among service providers to reach recipients that may belong to different service providers For businesses they can view the invoices in their systems or through a browser In case of consumers they can access the invoices through online bank or web payment services We can use the direct payment scenario as an example to understand how banks function as service providers in Finvoice In direct payment scenario the bank credits consumerês account according to the invoice received from the invoicer First the invoicer sends an Invoicer Notiìcation through its service provider to consumerês service provider The consumer then agrees to use direct payment and return a Reception Notiìcation Upon receiving the notiìcation the invoicer sends the invoice in an agreed manner while an electronic copy of Finvoice is routed to consumerês service provider Consumerês service provider will execute the fund transfer in accordance with the invoice Some of the strictest e-invoicing regulations are enacted in Latin America including Mexico Brazil and Chile The government of each of these countries plays a strong role in initiating and pushing the e-invoice movement usually for beneìts such as reducing tax evasion and real-time auditing Typical characteristics of e-invoicing in Latin America include permanent and unique invoice numbers stringent invoice format and the use of digital signatures/certiìcates For example in Mexico national tax authority Servicio de Administracin Tributaria SAT decreed that any company whose annual revenue is larger than two million pesos must use e-invoices Me xican e-in v oicing or Comprobante Fiscal Digital CFDI features clear standards for XML schema processing storage integration and even printing of invoices Under CFDI companies must sign up with a government-approved service provider acquire various electronic tokens and comply with strict validation rules Other countries of Latin America follow a similar approach such as Brazilês Nota Fiscal Electronica which claims a market penetration of Such outstanding results in vite us for a closer look Brazilês e-invoice system Nota Fiscal Electronica NF-e is based on the Chilean experience of Factura Electronica Initiated in 2005 it was meant to be a part of the Pubilc Digital Bookkeeping System SPED which aimed at modernizing tax bookkeeping accounting bookkeeping and management of tax documents from businesses Similar to T aiw an NF-e constructed a central solution to e-invoicing that was applicable throughout the country 
B Latin America 
2207 


Any company can register for issuing NF-e and a typical ow starts with the issuing company generating an XML document that adheres to the NF-e format and includes its digital signature This document is then transmitted through the Internet via secure channels to tax authority which validates it against NF-e standards and returns authorization to use the le Simultaneously a copy of the document is sent to the national repository of electronic documents Federal Revenue Service Note that the previous steps are all performed in real-time When the company receives the authorization it should make the NF-e available to the purchaser or print a simpliìed graphic representation of the NF-e called Auxiliary NF-e Document DANFE that will accompany the transferred goods DANFE contains an access key to the actual invoice online and a onedimension barcode that encodes the same information This barcode is for veriìcation purposes for instance by inspectors of state borders Once the addressee receives the goods it should check the validity and authenticity of NF-e or DANFE on tax authorityês website Brazilês strategy to promote NF-e was vigorous Companies that opted for NF-e were forbidden to use paper tax document Customer who received paper tax documents from such company must also refuse the goods sent By 2010 all industries and wholesalers in Brazil must issue NF-e This did not mean small and medium enterprises were disadvantaged a free program for issuing NF-e was available to these companies Over 40 of NF-eês are issued in this way With the success of NF-e digitalization of other tax documents are under way further advancing the SPED project From the information above similarities among all three systems Finvoice NF-e and Taiwanese e-invoice are mostly technological The usage of XML or derivatives of the language is suited to describe e-invoice data in human-readable format and easy to process by information systems Digital signatures or other variants of security devices are also present in order to guarantee authenticity of e-invoice All implementations use the Internet portals and websites as a medium to transfer data Between Finland and Taiwan one large difference is in the infrastructure Finvoice is powered by service providers in a distributed network whereas Taiwan e-invoice has a centralized platform hosted by government The reason why Taiwanese e-invoice is centralized may have to do with its roots in the UI and UIL At rst the purpose of centralization is to enact a national standard to ght tax evasion As UI and UIL become integral to economic activities too much cost and risk would be involved if e-invoice demanded a total reform of tax policies Brazil shared a similar motive when building NF-e but its cause to ght tax evasion is strongly valid even today From here we can conclude that taxrelated requirements have high inîuence on the infrastructure of e-invoice system Although Brazil and Taiwan share similar motives its invoicing process is apparently stricter and more real-time than Taiwanês With NF-e generated XML documents have to be validated in real-time before they can be used and sent In Taiwan the e-invoices can be batch-uploaded to the E-invoice Platform 48 hours after transaction at the latest The degree of exibility given to Taiwanese businesses may constitute as a strategy to encourage adoption However in the case of NFe coercive laws do not mean low adoption rate One can say Brazil uses force to quickly achieve adoption and Taiwan uses incentives to persuade adoption Again this difference could be due to the pressing need to reform bookkeeping processes in Brazil which affects numerous types of tax documents The issue of B2C e-invoicing may also determine which kind of change is preferred a clear-cut point when traditional invoice is legal or not can result in confusion among consumers negatively impacting the economy In the case of Taiwan a gradual introduction that is compatible with previous systems is required In conclusion a national effort of implementing einvoice can be coercive or gradual depending on the political agenda and target population VI C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK Taiwanês Uniform Invoice system is worth studying because thanks to the accompanying lottery mechanism that incentivizes people to request invoices upon transaction the system has proven quite effective in curbing tax-related exploitations The system can thus be adopted by other countries to combat tax evasion and boost tax income For instance Brazil has incorporated a similar incentive program using casting of lots to increase consumer requests for invoices in 2007 Migrating from conventional paper invoices to e-invoices however is not a simple task as it involves many changes in procedures regulations and consumer behaviours While some of the changes are common to other e-invoicing projects around the globe some of them are unique to Taiwanês einvoicing system due to its nature in invoice format and the accompanying lottery mechanism For example with paper invoices anyone who possesses a B2C invoice that won a UI Lottery prize can claim the prize For e-invoice some mechanism is needed to associate an e-invoice to a person and this is why the concept of carriers was introduced Although the concept of carriers eases the UI Lottery process and helps consumers manage their transaction records it also brings changes to transactions and raises some security and privacy concerns Therefore we discussed the beneìts obstacles and potential solutions to the problem Adoption of e-invoice is not a problem limited to only consumers rather businesses and government all have their own concerns Kreuzer et al.ês model of e-invoice adoption has outlined the 8 major categories of factors involved in the decision process We have incorporated these factors into our assessment and found different parties have different emphases Consumers according to this case study on Taiwan are inîuenced more strongly by technological and social factors Businesses pay closer attention to institutional legal and educational factors The government as the one implementing e-invoice has to consider all the above factors and commit to a political strategy This model echoes well with our empirical ndings and we expect to see more vigorous analysis and experiment in future

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

Querying    Fig 8 Accuracy of Cost Model    Fig 9 Performance vs Freshness On each HBase-R node the key/values are stored in format Though only one or two versions of the same key are returned to MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
