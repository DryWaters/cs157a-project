A Privacy-aware Query Authentication Index for Database Outsourcing Miyoung Jang Dept. of Computer Engineering Chonbuk National University Jeonju, Republic of Korea brilliant@jbnu.ac.kr Min Yoon Dept. of Computer Engineering Chonbuk National University Jeonju, Republic of Korea myoon@jbnu.ac.kr  Jae-Woo Chang Dept. of Computer Engineering Chonbuk National University Jeonju, Republic of Korea jwchang@jbnu.ac.kr  Abstract 227 Recently, cloud computing has been spotlighted as a 
new paradigm of database management system. In this environment, databases are outsourced and deployed on a service provider in order to reduce cost for data storage and maintenance. However, the service provider might be untrusted so that the two issues of data security, including data confidentiality and query result integrity, become major concerns for users. Existing bucket-based data authentication methods have problem that the original spatial data distribution can be disclosed from data authentication index due to the unsophisticated data grouping strategies. In addition the transmission overhead of verification object is high. In this paper, we propose a privacy-aware query authentication which 
guarantees data confidentiality and query result integrity for users. A periodic function-based data grouping scheme is designed to privately partition a spatial database into small groups for generating a signature of each group. The group signature is used to check the correctness and completeness of outsourced data when answering a range query to users Through performance evaluation, it is shown that proposed method outperforms the existing method in terms of range query processing time up to 3 times Keywords- Database outsourcing; Encrypted database; Data authentication index; Query result integrity I  I NTRODUCTION  Due to the advancement in cloud computing technologies 
the research on the outsourced database has been spotlighted as a new paradigm of database management system. Smallsize Location-based Service \(LBS\ businesses outsource their spatial database to a service provider in order to reduce cost for data storage and management. The services provider maintains the data and answers queries to users. However privacy needs to be preserved for sensitive databases \(e.g personal location data, financial and medical record\ that are valuable and sensitive to unauthorized accesses. In addition because a service provider is not the owner of outsourced database, it must prove the correctness and completeness of query result to users. In this context, two issues of data security including data confidentiality and data integrity 
become major concerns for users. Data confidentiality refers to protecting data access and disclosure from unauthorized parties. Data integrity refers to the trustworthiness of data especially for query users. For example, since the service provider is not fully trusted, the service provider may inject fake data in the query result, or may delete some genuine result data before sending them to users. The straightforward solution for protecting data confidentiality is database encryption. Many researches have been studied on database encryption, such as AES [1  O P E S  2   s c h e m e s  B y  adopting those encryption schemes, data confidentiality for users can be solved On the other hand, in order to guarantee data integrity 
verification information is sent to users with query result so that the result can be verified by using data owner\222s signature Previous data authentication researches  b e categorized into three classes: signature-based approaches authenticated data structures and bucket-based authentication However, authentication data structure does not guarantee the data confidentiality, since it cannot be built on the encrypted data. In addition, tree-based index suffer from inflexible data update and verification object transmission costs. To address these problems, J. Wang et al s e d  a bucket-based authentication where a bucket contains a bucket id, data range \(upper-lower bound\number of tuples in a bucket and a checksum. A checksum is similar concept 
to the data signature and generated by using a Hash function The limitations of existing bucket-based authentication are as followings. First, because it generates a bucket with equal width of the data range, the original data distribution can be disclosed. Moreover bucket id is assigned as the ascending order of the data range. The existing bucket-based authentication cannot fully provide the data security Secondly, existing bucket-based authentication methods only consider conventional relational database. The distribution of database may not be the objects to be protected. However, in terms of spatial database, the distribution of them could involve meaningful knowledge. To provide full-range of privacy protection coverage for spatial database, any 
additional information, including data distribution, of database can be revealed Motivated by these problems, in this paper, we propose a privacy-aware query authentication which supports data correctness and completeness for users. To support data confidentiality, it is assumed that databases are encrypted before outsourced to a service provider by using AES algorithm. In order to process range queries over encrypted corresponding autho r  72
