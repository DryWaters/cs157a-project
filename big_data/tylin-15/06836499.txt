contacts In contrast it can be seen that both the total data volume for the network and the percentage of utilization of the antennas is accurate to less than 10 This relative error is in fact accountable to exogenous sources of error during the validation process i.e missing information from the TDRSS dataset As an example the TDRSS schedule did not contain the names of the missions that the network is currently supporting thus leaving the orbital parameters for the missions as an undesired degree of freedom 5 R ESULTS Architectural decisions Table 6 lists the decisions included in the results herein presented with their set of allowed values They create a tradespace of 4,450 architectures that was effectively reduced to 1,440 with two constraints A maximum of 2 antennas can be placed on the same satellite and a maximum of 9 satellites can be put in orbit The 002rst constraint is included in order to prevent complex satellite con\002gurations with more than 2 high gain parabolic dishes The second antenna is included to reduce the size of the tradespace to a manageable set and prevent highly disaggregated architectures 050each communication payload 003ying separately\051 that should be studied together with fractionation options 050not addressed in this paper\051 Note the large span of architectures being explored On the one hand TDRSS-like architectures are reproduced as an instance of constellations of monolithic satellites procured and then operated by NASA On the other hand fully hosted payload architectures are considered with one or two antennas being hosted Finally architectures that disaggregate TDRSS-like multi-band payloads into a low data rate payload and a high data rate payload are also analyzed 050see 002gure 2\051 This becomes interesting due to the non-trivial couplings between the decisions For instance is it better to host a low data rate payload as opposed to tri-band TDRSS-like payload Does having separate low and high data rate antenna provide greater network capacity due to greater scheduling 003exibility Scenario description As previously stated the generation of a scenario for the 2020-2030 time frame implies forecasting the types and number of missions and specifying their communication requirements For this study it is assumed that the number of missions stays approximately constant as compared to what the TDRSS is currently supporting through its single access services It is also assumed that the missions use similar concept of operations as today and therefore the total requested scheduled time is on the same order of magnitude However in order to accommodate for the higher data volumes that missions are expected to require the contact data rates are increased from the current hundreds of Mbps to more than one Gbps The resulting scenario consists of a set of 15 missions from NASA NOAA and USGS The NASA Earth observation community has eight missions using the network 2 of them being major drivers 050e.g a DESDYNI class mission 2 more being medium sized missions and 4 more being smallsats A mission becomes a driver for the network if its required data rate at least doubles the capabilities of the current TDRSS and the total desired data volume is greater than 10Tbit/day On the other hand the NASA astrophysics and heliophysics community are represented through 4 missions one of which is considered to be a driver and the other three are medium sized missions These medium sized missions typically return 030 1Tbit/day Similarly the human space\003ight stakeholder is considered to have 2 missions in orbit one similar to the International Space Station 050ISS\051 and another one representative of a MultiPurpose Crew Vehicle 050MPCV\051 capsule The ISS-like is a driver both in terms of required scheduled time 050continuous contact throughout the day is required\051 and data volume In turn the MPCV-like missions only requires support for a long continuous periods of time 050 030 5 hours\051 Finally the NOAA and USGS mission are also included in the scenario but are expected to be users of the system In this case it is assumed that they will use the network for contingency situations and therefore will schedule a maximum of two 5 to 10 minute contacts For each of the described mission at least two types of service are included a science return service and a telemetry tracking and command 050TT&C\051 service Additionally the human space\003ight missions also have high de\002nition 050HD\051 video services required As a result the mission scenario has a total of 213 required contacts per day that account for 115 hours of total schedulable time and a total data volume of 130Tbit/day Payload band selection and allocation The payload band selection and allocation problem looks at what are the best frequency bands to be included in the system and how to best allocate them in relay satellites In order to provide a stable comparison this study assumes that all satellites are procured and then operated by NASA Figure 3 presents the obtained tradespace and 003ags the set of architectures that achieve the best performance for a given total life cycle cost 050LCC\051 These architectures have the following characteristics 1  Monolithic architecture with one single access antenna 050SA\051 per satellite supporting only S-band 2  Monolithic architecture with one SA per satellite supporting S Ku and Ka-bands simultaneously 3  Monolithic architecture with two SA per satellite one supporting S-band and the other one supporting Ku and Kaband 4  Monolithic architecture with two SA per satellite one supporting Ku and Ka-band and the other one supporting S Ku and Ka-band simultaneously 5  Disaggregated architecture with 3 satellites carrying two SA antennas one supporting S-band and the other one supporting Ku and Ka-band and 3 more satellites carrying two SA antennas one supporting Ku and Ka-band and the other one supporting optical communications Based on the analysis of the overall tradespace the following conclusions can be drawn First an all optical architecture achieves a very low score in bene\002t 0500.1 approximately\051 but is potentially less expensive than most only RF and RF/optical architectures This is because the mission scenario used for this simulation only included two missions with data rates high enough 050  1Gbps\051 that they required optical communications Second the incremental value of having Sband for TT&C services is approximately 40 of the bene\002t Similarly having K-band for science data return services provides an extra 50 to 55 of the bene\002t Third the current TDRSS architecture is able to provide approximately 84 of the total bene\002t although the same level of performance can be obtained with the less costly architecture 4 050of the previous list\051 Finally architectures that obtain maximum bene\002t sup9

Figure 4  Payload Allocation Figure 5  Procurement vs Hosted Payloads Hosted payloads vs 100 procurement This case study focuses on the impact of including hosted payloads as part of the system Figure 5 presents an extended representation of the tradespace where hosted payload architectures are included The 002rst immediate conclusion that can be drawn is that based on the cost model from hosted payloads offer the possibility of signi\002cant cost reductions 050between 15 and 30%\051 As a result all architectures on the Pareto front rely on hosted payload architectures On the other hand concerns about using hosted payload assets for critical applications like astronaut support have been 003agged as a major caveat In this case an optimal solution would entail using a portfolio of hosted payloads and privately owned satellites and schedule the communications through ones or the others according to operational constraints Therefore building this portfolio can be done by analyzing what communication payloads are better suited for hosted payload con\002gurations Figure 6 presents the tradespace of architectures that mix hosted payload and procured assets Results indicate that including hosted payload assets in the system does not have a major impact on its performance but requires disaggregating the monolithic satellites identi\002ed as optimal in the previous case study That being the case the next questions arise Figure 6  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets Which payload obtains better savings when being hosted How many payloads do you want to 003y in a hosted payload approach The answer for the 002rst question can be obtained by analyzing the non-dominated architectures from 002gure 6 and estimating the cost savings when hosting the different types of antennas that are considered in this analysis Results indicate that hosting an optical payload can potentially save an 28 of the cost while a low data rate antenna 050S-band\051 only obtains a 16 cost reduction 050note that these numbers are based on the system life-cycle cost and are heavily in\003uenced by the hosted payload cost model\051 Therefore it seems to be more advisable to put high data rate payloads like optical terminals in commercial satellites and retain control of S-band communications 050which in turn ensures that contingency event will be addressed by privately owned assets not constrained by the operational limitations of host platforms\051 Finally 002gure 7 presents the tradespace of hosted payload architectures color coded by the number of antennas that are being hosted By looking at the Pareto front it can be seen that almost all architectures host one single antenna as opposed to two in order to minimize the burden on the host platform This burden is also contingent on the mass and power of the hosted communication payload This is the main reason why optical terminals become so attractive for hosted payload architectures as opposed to low frequency systems that require big parabolic antennas and power ampli\002ers to close the link budgets 6 C ONCLUSION Summary This paper has presented the 002rst set of results obtained through the developed architectural tool to evaluate space communication networks It has 002rst provided a high level overview of the tool with a description of four main constitutive elements An STK model an architecture generator an architecture evaluator and a resource manager Next it has described the newly developed scheduling algorithm based on a rule-based expert system that ef\002ciently allocates the network resources to satisfy near-Earth mission communication requirements Then a discussion on the conducted validation exercise has 11 


Figure 7  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets been presented in order to gain some level of con\002dence on the results that the tool outputs This discussion has focused on the validation of the scheduling algorithm by benchmarking it with operational schedules from the TDRSS Finally this paper has presented two case studies for future implementations of the TDRSS system Based on a demand forecast for the network a 002rst case study has considered the problem of selecting the frequency band to be supported and how to allocate them into the relay satellites It has been shown that maximum performance architectures require a mix of optical and RF payloads that support high throughput communications as well as reliable low data rate communications If the traditional procurement strategy is assumed 050NASA buys and operates the relay satellites\051 then monolithic architectures are preferable unless more than two high gain antennas render the resulting satellite con\002guration too complex In turn the second case study has extended this analysis by introducing architectures with hosted payloads It has been shown that according to the current available pricing model hosted payload architectures are clearly preferable than the traditional procurement strategy with cost savings between 15 to 30 for the same level of system performance It has then been discussed the advantages of having mixed procured and hosted payload architectures as a compromise to obtain networks with reduced lifecycle costs that can still address the requirements of highly sensitive and reliable applications Results have demonstrated that high data rate payloads 050speci\002cally optical payloads\051 are the best candidates to be hosted 050with savings up to 28%\051 thanks to their reduced mass and power requirement On the other hand low data rate communication payload should be allocated in privately owned satellites as they require bigger antennas and power ampli\002ers that increase the burden on the host platform Future Work The main streams of future work are as twofold On one hand additional features should be added to the model in order to better capture the complexity of the network con\002gurations 050e.g coupling between the costs of the communication payloads depending on the level of on-orbit processing the they perform\051 Additionally the size of the tradespace is currently limited to less than two thousand architectures due to computational limitations a stringent limitation given the possible combinations from the identi\002ed architectural decisions The solution currently under development is to include a genetic algorithm that alleviates this problem by iteratively generates new populations of architectures by combining the best previously evaluated networks On the other hand the other main stream of future work is related to exercising the tool in a variety of architectural decisions and mission scenarios In the presented case studies only geosynchronous constellations were considered although the tool allows comparing them with systems that place relays in MEO and LEO orbits Additionally the tool can also provide insight in valuing inter-satellite links and how the cost of putting in orbit their extra communication payloads can be leveraged by reducing the number of operating ground stations Moreover couplings between the payload allocation and fractionation strategy should also be further explored so as to understand if monolithic architectures still become preferable if relay satellites can be decomposed in clusters of independent antennas and payloads Finally supplementary what-if analysis can be conducted based on 0501\051 the demand forecast for the 2020-2030 time frame 0502\051 granted spectrum allocations to NASA and 0503\051 technology improvements that increase the spectral ef\002ciency of the communication payloads 12
