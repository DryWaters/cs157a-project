process and how they are captured in the forms of rules The second area of focus of this work is the validation of the tool's performance and cost models In order to do that four main actions need to be performed 002rst check the communication systems design module that sizes the antennas and payloads for the relay satellites Second compare the performance of the scheduling algorithm with TDRSS operational data so as to ensure that its inherent heuristics are representative of how the system operates Third validate the spacecraft design algorithm that designs the subsystems of the relay satellite based on the communication payloads it carries and fourth assess the accuracy of the cost estimation module that predicts the space and ground segment cost Although all these actions have been or are currently being performed this paper will focus exclusively on the validation of the scheduling algorithm Finally the third objective of this paper is to demonstrate the tool usefulness by presenting its outputs given a prede\002ned scenario for the 2020-2030 time period This scenario is based on the stakeholder analysis conducted as part of this effort 050also introduced in b ut not e xplicitly addressed in this paper The results are presented in the form of twodimensional tradespaces that use system performance and cost as the two main metrics Additionally the tradespaces are categorized based on the options for the considered architectural decisions This allows identi\002cation of generic trends and shared characteristics for non-dominated architectures that can be insightful to decision makers Paper Structure The reminder of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 provides an overview of the tool along with a short description of the main components of the performance and cost models Section 3 introduces the newly developed scheduling algorithm its assumptions data structures and inherent heuristics In turn section 4 describes the tool validation results with especial emphasis on the benchmarking of the scheduling algorithm with real TDRSS operational data Finally section 5 presents the results of exercising the model and looking at different cuts of the architectural tradespace 2 M ODEL O VERVIEW The goal of this section is to provide an overview of the architectural tool developed to analyze the performance and cost of space communication network that provide support to near-Earth satellites It 002rst synthesizes the set of decisions used to generate the space of candidate network architectures along with their allowed values It then describes the inputs to the tool with respect to the demand forecast for the system that is how to specify what missions will be using it and what will their communication needs be Finally it introduces the different modules of the tool focusing on those directly related to the computing the performance and the cost of the system Architectural Decisions Table 1 lists the set of decisions used to generate different system architectures Note that this list is an extension of what was presented in in order to include architectures that use inter-satellite links vary the number of ground stations and use fractionated spacecraft Note that disaggre g ation refers to distribution of relay-to-user payloads whereas fractionation refers to distribution of the space-to-ground Figure 1  Stakeholder decomposition payload Scenario de\002nition In order to evaluate the performance of a space communication network it is necessary to understand the set of potential users of the system and their requirements In this case these users are near-Earth missions that connect to the relay satellites in order to return their data to Earth and receive commands from their respective mission control centers Since the goal of this work is to identify good architectures for the 2020-2030 time frame specifying the set of potential customers requires forecasting the missions that will be 003ying in the next decade 050along with their communication subsystem needs\051 and creating a scenario that is representative of a typical day of operations for the system Two main inputs are required to fully de\002ne a scenario First a stakeholder decomposition that lists all the potential stakeholders for the network and assigns a weight to measure their relative importance Each stakeholder has in turn different objectives which contain sets of missions that require the network support Additionally each mission has a set of demanded services 050telemetry command science return etc.\051 that capture its communication needs As an example 002gure 1 presents a stakeholder decomposition for a NASA centric space communication network For stakeholder NASA four objectives are identi\002ed each one corresponding to a major scienti\002c community in the agency 050Astrophysics Heliophysics Earth Observation and Human Space Flight\051 Additionally the U.S Geological Survey 050USGS\051 and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 050NOAA\051 are also known to use the current TDRSS through the Landsat and the Polar Operational Environmental Satellites Therefore they are also included as potential stakeholders to the system At the very end of the stakeholder decomposition lay the different communication services requested by the network customers For each service 002ve parameters have to be speci\002ed number of desired contacts duration per contact data rate maximum acceptable latency and minimum time between contacts These parameters are used by the scheduling algorithm in order to compute a plausible schedule for the whole system and assess how well the network can meet a mission communication requirements 2

general structure of the tool is composed by four main parts An STK model that computes the ph ysical infor mation of the system for all possible con\002gurations on the network an architecture generator that creates all possible architectures based on the set of architectural decisions and their allowed values an architecture evaluator that given an input architecture computes its cost and bene\002t and a resource manager that parallelizes the evaluation process by allocating architectures among different evaluators as they become available The STK model performs the orbital computations for the tool In particular STK is used to simulate a typical day of operations of the network by propagating the movement of both the customer missions the relay satellites and the ground stations Additionally it computes the contact opportunities between the different nodes of the network be it through a direct link or through a multi-hop path and obtains an estimate of the distances of the inter-satellite and space-toground links The architecture generator is composed by a set of rules that enumerates all possible combinations for the speci\002ed architectural decisions and outputs an array of architectures that are ready for evaluation The formulation of these rules is generic i.e it uses architectural patterns that formulate the architecture generation process as a combinatorial problem  As an e xample the payload-to-spacecraft allocation decision can be viewed as an instance of a partitioning problem in which given a prede\002ned set of communication payloads one is interested in 002nding the best grouping into satellites 050all in a unique spacecraft all distributed in different spacecrafts 003ying as a cluster or combination of these options\051 Note also that in some cases the decisions are not independent but rather tightly coupled For instance the payload-tospacecraft allocation decision can be preceded by a payload band selection problem in which a subset of communication payloads 002rst are being selected and then allocated into the corresponding satellites The architecture evaluator takes as input one architecture and obtains an estimate of its bene\002t and cost In order to do that the following high level process is followed First the architecture is decomposed into its constituents 050constellations clusters satellites antennas payloads\051 and their properties 050e.g antenna diameter payload frequency band etc.\051 are imported from a database Next the information of the system decomposition is used along with the outputs of the STK model in order to compute a possible schedule for the network and design the different types of relay satellites Once this has been done the last step is to compute the bene\002t and cost of the overall system For the former the satisfaction of a mission is assessed by comparing its desired communication requirements with what the system has granted him through the schedule This satisfaction is then aggregated to a single metric through the stakeholder decomposition previously presented 050\002gure 1\051 On the other hand the cost of the network is obtained by computing an estimate of the space and ground segment cost based on the design of the different relay satellites and the building and operations cost for the network ground stations Finally the last part of the tool is a resource manager that enables parallel computing Given an array of architectures produced by the architecture generator the resource manager creates an independent thread for each and queues them for evaluation It then creates a pool of architecture evaluators and progressively wakes the threads as evaluators in the pool become free The architecture evaluator Overview of performance model\227 The performance of the satellite communication network is assessed based on the outputs of the scheduling algorithm 050a detailed description is presented in section 3\051 For each service demanded by a mission three metrics are computed number of granted contacts maximum latency and user burden The number of granted contacts indicates how many times the customer mission connects with a relay satellite to download and/or upload information Since all contacts for a particular service and mission have the same nominal data rate and duration computing the number of granted contacts is effectively equivalent to computing the fraction of the data volume returned to Earth 050scaled by a factor\051  returned DV  DV ret  DV des  R b 001 T c 001  GC  R b 001 T c 001  DC   GC   DC 0501\051 where DV ret is the returned data volume DV tot is the total data volume to return R b is the contact nominal data rate T c is the contact duration  GC is the number of granted contacts and  DC is the number of desired contacts 3 


On the other hand the maximum latency computes the maximum amount of time that a mission will have to hold its collected data in the on-board memory before being able to download it This metric is important in some applications where the scienti\002c information from the satellites is used to obtain periodic data products 050e.g images from weather satellites might be needed every three hours to update weather predictions and issue alerts if necessary\051 Similarly this metric can be important for mission controllers that do not want satellite operating without supervision for long periods of time As a worst case estimate this maximum latency is computed as the maximum time between consecutive contacts Finally the user burden is used as a proxy for how dif\002cult it is for a mission to connect to the network This burden is measured in terms of the Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power 050EIRP\051 that the communication subsystem of customer mission has to provide in order to close the link with the relay satellite It is assumed that this link will always operate at nominal data rate so that if all contacts get scheduled then the returned data volume will equal the desired daily data volume for the mission Once these three metrics have been computed the satisfaction of a particular service can be directly assessed by comparing their values to a set of step functions that capture each missions preferences For instance a human space 003ight mission might heavily value not dropping contacts because continuous communication with the astronauts is essential to the mission safety Therefore if a contact is lost then its satisfaction might be 20 050in a normalized 0 to 100 scale\051 or even almost null Alternatively a small astrophysics mission might not consider critical to have all its desired contacts scheduled since the scienti\002c data it gathers is not time sensitive Thus if a contact is lost then only a 5 of the satisfaction is lost Overview of cost model\227 The cost model provides a rough estimate of the lifecycle cost of the architecture The model distinguishes between recurring and non-recurring cost and includes payload cost bus cost launch cost operations cost ground segment cost and service fees The obtained estimate depends on the contract modality of the architecture For 100 procurement architectures payload bus launch operations and ground segment cost both non-recurring and recurring are paid by NASA No service fees are incurred For 100 hosted payloads the tool uses two different pricing models taken from namely 223pay per mass\224 and 223resource pricing.\224 The pay per mass pricing model includes systems engineering integration and testing cost which is a fraction of the total bus and payload cost and then insurance cost operator cost and a certain pro\002t are added as constant percentages that get compounded to yield the 002nal estimate The resource pricing model takes into account everything in the pay per mass mode plus a marginal bus and launch cost These delta costs are based on the fraction of resources 050mass power\051 of the host spacecraft that are used by the hosted payload Lastly 100 commercial services costs are computed at a 002xed price per MB of data Payload cost estimates include the cost of the antennas and the cost of all electronics They are based on Cost Estimating Relationships 050CER\051 provided in Bus cost is also estimated using CER from These CER pro vide estimates of recurring and non-recurring cost at the subsystem level and therefore require subsystem masses as an input Subsystem masses are computed by an iterative spacecraft design algorithm that sizes the bus subsystems based on payload requirements and orbital considerations On the other hand launch cost is computed as the total required number of launches times the price of one launch for a set of launch vehicles and the less costly option is selected The number of launches required is calculated by taking into account the mass and dimensions of the spacecraft as well as the orbit and the performance envelope of each launch vehicle Operations cost represents the cost of operating the relay satellites and it is simply computed as a 002xed number times the number of relays in the constellation Finally ground segment cost includes the cost of constructing a new ground station when necessary plus the recurring maintenance and operations costs 3 S CHEDULING A LGORITHM The goal of this section is to explain the scope assumptions and heuristics inherent to the rule-based scheduling algorithm developed for rapid evaluation of space communication networks Assumptions The 002rst and most important assumption for the proposed rule-based scheduling algorithm is that of non-optimality This assumption is grounded in two facts First the scheduling process is done following a greedy approach i.e contacts are scheduled whenever it is possible regardless of future states of the network Second when more than one network resource can serve a contact deciding which one to chose is done based on a set of heuristic rules On the other hand it is also important to note that the proposed scheduling algorithm only addresses the problem of the access network that is the allocation of resources between network customers and network nodes This simpli\002cation is done in order to facilitate the scheduling process and decouple it from the intricacies of the routing algorithm implemented in the backbone network Finally the third assumption for the scheduling algorithm is related to its inputs It is assumed that all the required information will be available at the start of the process and no numeric computations 050e.g propagating satellites\051 will have to be done inline with the scheduling process This fact is further explored in the following subsection High-level Structure of the Scheduling Algorithm The inputs of the scheduling algorithm come from 0501\051 the set of users that want to connect with the network and their relative priorities 0502\051 the contact opportunities between them and the relay satellites and 0503\051 the contact opportunities between these satellites and the system ground stations While 0501\051 is an input to the tool based on demand forecasts 0502\051 and 0503\051 are dependent on the structure of the network 050i.e where relay satellites are placed and what communication payloads they carry\051 and involve computing the motion of the satellites over a time period 050typically one day\051 Two strategies for computing the contact opportunities are possible Performing the orbital computations inline with the evaluation of the network architectures or pre-computing the contact opportunities and then tailoring this information to the speci\002c implementation of the network architecture In 4 


the 002rst strategy the orbital and line of sight computations are performed each time that an architecture has to be evaluated This is easiest approach since the network is fully de\002ned and therefore there is no ambiguity with respect to the satellites and payloads that are placed into orbit Nevertheless it also limits the computational performance of the tradespace exploration tool because it increases the time required to evaluate one architecture On the other hand the second strategy decouples the problem of computing contact opportunities from the actual physical implementation of the network In this approach contact opportunities are only calculated between orbital positions These orbital positions can contain either one satellite or a set of satellites with multiple communication payloads each The main advantage of this apporach is that the orbital positions for the network nodes are a 002xed input and do not depend on the architectural decisions Being that the case one can 002rst calculate contact opportunities between all possible orbital positions and then replicate or eliminate them as needed depending on the details of the architecture under evaluation Once the contact opportunities between the network customers and the relay satellites have been computed the next step is to understand which of them are valid given the system characteristics For instance a contact from a bent-pipe architecture will only be valid if the relay satellite is at the same time connected to a ground station Alternatively a packetswitched architecture with on-board storage can use a store and forward mode of operation where it 002rst communicates with a customer then stores temporarily the information and 002nally dumps it to a ground station Taking into account these considerations is done by trimming the customer-to-relay contact opportunities 050from now on visibility windows 051 based on the relay-to-ground-station contact opportunities 050from now on paths  since they might require multi-hop communication through inter-satellite links\051 and the network type under consideration Note that this process cannot be pre-computed since it requires information on the architecture being evaluated but it can be optimized by also pre-computing the paths with and without inter-satellite links and then creating rules that trim the visibility windows starting and ending times accordingly Once this process is complete the scheduling algorithm is ready to start allocating network resources to customers It now has a complete description of the access network through the visibility windows and it has also captured the 002rst order effects of the type of backbone network Next the scheduling algorithm has to decide the order with which contacts will be served This is done by assigning a priority to each contact 050from now on required contact 051 The details of the heuristics used for contact prioritization are explained later in this section Finally the last step of the scheduling algorithm is to compare the visibility windows with the required contacts until there are no more contacts to schedule or there are no more free resources on the network This comparison has to take into account the following factors 1  Frequency band compatibility A visibility window is suitable for scheduling a contact if it uses the same frequency band 050or optical wavelength\051 than the customer mission 2  Data rate A visibility window is suitable for scheduling a contact if the nominal data rate it can support is higher than the requested data rate by the customer mission 3  Duration A visibility window is suitable for scheduling a contact if its duration is longer than that of the contact or if it can be concatenated with other visibility windows to achieve an overall duration longer than that of the contact 4  Network status A visibility window is suitable for scheduling a contact only if its state 050starting and ending times\051 has been updated based on the past scheduled contacts Note that 0501\051 and 0502\051 are not tied to the physical geometry of the system but rather to the communication payloads that are carried by the customers and relay satellites Alternatively 0503\051 depends primarily on the satellites motion and captures the idea that the system performs handovers as the customer loses support from a relay and then connects to another one The speci\002c heuristics used for selecting the best visibility window and performing handovers is explained later in this section Lastly 0504\051 takes into account the evolution of the network resources as contacts are progressively scheduled In particular once a contact is allocated it is mandatory to update the status of the visibility windows so that they are accordingly trimmed or eliminated Data Structures Based on the description from the previous subsection four main data structures are required in order to capture the state of the network and perform the scheduling process visibilitywindow  path  required-contact and customer  In a rule-based expert system these data structures come in the form of facts  i.e a container of any sort of information As an example a fact 224car\223 can contain multiple properties 050slots\051 such as color mass power or make Table 2 lists the four main facts of the scheduling algorithm along with their slots It can be seen that the visibilitywindows and paths have a similar structure an origin node 050a customer for the 002rst and a satellite for the second\051 a destination node 050a satellite vs a ground-station\051 a starting time and an ending time Note also that they have the slot 224orbital-position\223 that is used to pre-compute these facts The visibility-windows also include information regarding the band and nominal-data-rate so that it is easily accessible when determining their suitability to service a particular contact Similarly a path has a slot 224ISL\223 that is used as proxy for multi-hop or single-hop contact between a relay and a ground station As previously stated if the architecture under evaluation does not support ISLs then the contact opportunities will be trimmed according to paths computed without ISLs On the other hand the facts required-contact contain two different types of data information regarding the characterization of the contact such as the user requesting it the service expected duration priority frequency band and nominal data rates On the other hand it also contains information on how well the contact has been served by the network Finally the customers facts keep track of the temporal evolution of the customer satellites during the scheduling process All satellites start with their slot 224time\223 at 0 and progressively increase its value as contacts get scheduled If at a particular instant in time the network cannot provide access to the customer then the 224time\223 slot is increased n 001 001 t n  0 until the access can be granted or the scheduling algorithm reaches its simulation end Note also that this process is repeated for each customer and service i.e a satellite will be able to independently schedule contacts used for telemetry and science data return 5

subsection presents a description of the different heuristics inherent to the scheduling algorithm They have been categorized into two main areas heuristics for customer prioritization and heuristics for visibility window selection and concatenation Customer prioritization\227 As previously stated in order to build a schedule that maximizes the system bene\002t it is important to prioritize the customers and the services they require In this case this is done through the following heuristic P riority  M 001 mission class  service priority 0502\051 The mission class can take values 1  2  3  4  5 0505 being maximum priority\051 is used to capture the idea that some missions will always have higher priority due to speci\002c circumstances For instance a human space 003ight mission will always have more priority than any robotic mission since astronaut lives are at stake Alternatively service priority captures the importance of the the mission and service in the stakeholder-objective-mission-service decomposition used to compute the bene\002t of the system This metric is included so that the computed scheduled is maximizing the bene\002t score of the network Finally M is a control parameter that captures the relative importance between mission class and service priority  It is typically set to high value 050e.g 10000\051 to ensure that mission class is always the most important factor Visibility window selection and concatenation\227 Let's assume that a required contact has been selected as the next one to be served based on the prioritization When tackling the problem of scheduling it based on the available visibility windows  three questions arise 1  Are there any restrictions that limit the time at which the contact should be scheduled 2  If there is more than one visibility window that can completely overlap a contact which one has to be chosen 3  If there is more than one visibility window that can partially overlap a contact and none that can fully serve it which one has to be chosen for concatenation The answer to the 002rst question is in most cases yes Missions tend to prefer scheduling contacts when they have signi\002cant amounts of information to dump or when their batteries are almost fully charged Even operational constraints might arise with contacts being scheduled preferably during the normal working hours of the staff at the mission control center As a result most schedulers allow customers to provide their desired contact times along with a 003exibility window over which the event should be preferably scheduled  Despite the importance of these factors in real-life operations of satellite communication networks they are currently disregarded in the current scheduling algorithm The rationale for this is as twofold On the one hand the goal of the scheduler is to assess the overall capacity of network and capture the effect having extra satellites and communication payloads in orbit The authors realize that having extra scheduling constraints reduces the 003exibility of allocating the network resources thus potentially reducing the overall data 003ows through the network However they also assume this fact to be a second order effect compared to extra amount of resources that become available if more relay satellites are put into orbit On the other hand the scheduling process for the tool is based on a demand forecast beyond the 2020 time frame This implies high levels of uncertainty both on the number and types of missions that will be 003ying as well as on the operational aspects of the services they will demand Therefore taking into account scheduling constraints will be of limited usefulness since they will typically be unknown and dif\002cult to predict from existing missions Alternatively answering questions 0502\051 and 0503\051 is a complex problem that requires taking into account the duration of the visibility windows and how they can be concatenated in order to provide long periods of mission support In particular the following distinction is made A visibility window is said to completely overlap with a contact if its duration duration d wnd satis\002es equation 3 where d con is the contact duration If this inequality does not hold then the visibility window is said to partially overlap with the contact and requires concatenating multiple visibility windows until complete overlap is achieved This happens when equation 4 becomes true where d 0 wnd i represents the duration of the i th concatenated visibility window  trimmed accordingly with of the previous selected windows d 0 wnd j 000 1  d wnd   d con 0503\051 n X i 1 d 0 wnd i   d con 0504\051 Distinguishing between partial and complete overlap is important because it provides the condition to identify when a required contact can be immediately fully satis\002ed served versus the problem of using handovers to provide continuous support As it will now be explained these two situations entail different heuristics Partial vs complete overlap heuristics\227 Having identi\002ed the difference between partial and complete overlap  the next step is to identify the temporal conditions that characterize both situations Let t 0 be the time at which a customer wants to schedule a contact d the duration of the contact and t s i and t e i the 6 


starting and ending times of the i th visibility window Then a partial overlap exists if equation 5 holds while complete overlap requires equations 5 and 6 to be true at the same time t s i 024 t 0  t e i 0505\051 d 024 t e i 000 t 0 0506\051 Note also that equation 5 is a necessary but not suf\002cient condition for partial overlap  That being the case two strategies can be used to identify a partial overlap  Look for all the visibility windows that satisfy condition 5 and dissatisfy condition 6 or eliminate all visibility windows that satisfy conditions 5 and 6 at the same time Once the conditions for complete and partial overlap are understood the 002nal and most important step is to de\002ne the heuristics that will chose the best visibility window among the set that satisfy equations 5 and 6 050dissatisfy in the latter case\051 For complete overlap the following heuristic will be used The best visibility window is the one that minimizes the non-overlapping time with the contact  This is mathematically expressed in equation 7 where 050 t 0 000 t s i 051 expresses the non-overlapping time between the start of the visibility window and the start of the contact and 050 t e i 000 050 t 0  d 051\051 accounts for the non-overlapping time between the end of the visibility window and the end of the contact 050 t 0 000 t s i 051  050 t e i 000 050 t 0  d 051\051  000 t 0

the shortest one Recall however that equation 6 must also be true for complete overlap  thus indicating that the selected window will be the one with duration closest to the contact duration t e i 000

situation In this case the following heuristic will be used The best visibility window is the one with longer duration and shorter non-overlapping time between the start of the contact and the start of the visibility window  This is mathematically expressed in equation 9 where 050\050 t 0  d 051 000 t e i 051 is the time between the ending of the contact and the ending of the visibility window and 050 t 0 000 t s i 051 is the non-overlapping time between the start of the contact and the start of the visibility window As previously demonstrated with equations 7 and 8 equation 9 can be

the rule-based scheduling algorithm 4 B ENCHMARKING The goal of this section is to describe the validation process for the scheduling algorithm by comparing its outputs with real TDRSS operational data Dataset Description The Network Control Center Data System 050NCCDS\051 is the network control facility for the TDRSS Its scheduling activities include mission planning event scheduling scheduling con\003icts and support scheduling among others Although it is located in White Sands NM close to the White Sands Ground Terminal 050WSGT\051 and Second TDRSS Ground Terminal 050STGT\051 it controls the scheduling process for the entire network including the Guam Remote Ground Terminal 050GRGT\051 and its supported satellites The NCCDS interfaces with the mission operations centers 050MOCs\051 and responds to their requests by either granting events or mediating in case of scheduling con\003icts An extract of the NCCDS database used to schedule the TDRSS was obtained and analyzed It contained on twelve days of real TDRSS operational data containing information regarding the number and types of events scheduled each day the satellites and antennas through which they were served and the supported data rates for each of them The lessons learned from the analysis of this dataset 050total scheduled time total data volume antenna utilization etc.\051 are not disclosed on this paper due to non-disclosure agreement 050NDA\051 restrictions For the same reason the results for the validation case will only present percentages of error with respect to the real TDRSS performance Validation Methodology The proposed validation strategy for the scheduling algorithm undertakes the following steps 1  De\002ne aggregate metrics that capture the performance of the overall TDRSS scheduling system 2  Examine the validation data in order to characterize the TDRSS network and identify generic trends and typical days of operation 3  De\002ne representative mission scenarios that can be used as inputs to the tool 4  Benchmark the results from the rule-based scheduler with the real TDRSS operational data based on the metrics identi\002ed in 0501\051 The goal of step 0501\051 is to de\002ne a set of metrics that capture the load of the network as a whole rather than understanding the amount of information that 003ows through the different satellites The rationale for this approach follows from the initial intent of having a scheduling algorithm as part of this tool i.e to understand the global network capacity and the effect of putting new relay satellites in orbit Two metrics were identi\002ed as useful Total data volume DV total and percentage utilization  U t  The total data volume is used as a summary of how many contacts can be scheduled through the network The available TDRSS dataset contains information on the nominal data rate at which the scheduled contacts run the same information 7

contacts In contrast it can be seen that both the total data volume for the network and the percentage of utilization of the antennas is accurate to less than 10 This relative error is in fact accountable to exogenous sources of error during the validation process i.e missing information from the TDRSS dataset As an example the TDRSS schedule did not contain the names of the missions that the network is currently supporting thus leaving the orbital parameters for the missions as an undesired degree of freedom 5 R ESULTS Architectural decisions Table 6 lists the decisions included in the results herein presented with their set of allowed values They create a tradespace of 4,450 architectures that was effectively reduced to 1,440 with two constraints A maximum of 2 antennas can be placed on the same satellite and a maximum of 9 satellites can be put in orbit The 002rst constraint is included in order to prevent complex satellite con\002gurations with more than 2 high gain parabolic dishes The second antenna is included to reduce the size of the tradespace to a manageable set and prevent highly disaggregated architectures 050each communication payload 003ying separately\051 that should be studied together with fractionation options 050not addressed in this paper\051 Note the large span of architectures being explored On the one hand TDRSS-like architectures are reproduced as an instance of constellations of monolithic satellites procured and then operated by NASA On the other hand fully hosted payload architectures are considered with one or two antennas being hosted Finally architectures that disaggregate TDRSS-like multi-band payloads into a low data rate payload and a high data rate payload are also analyzed 050see 002gure 2\051 This becomes interesting due to the non-trivial couplings between the decisions For instance is it better to host a low data rate payload as opposed to tri-band TDRSS-like payload Does having separate low and high data rate antenna provide greater network capacity due to greater scheduling 003exibility Scenario description As previously stated the generation of a scenario for the 2020-2030 time frame implies forecasting the types and number of missions and specifying their communication requirements For this study it is assumed that the number of missions stays approximately constant as compared to what the TDRSS is currently supporting through its single access services It is also assumed that the missions use similar concept of operations as today and therefore the total requested scheduled time is on the same order of magnitude However in order to accommodate for the higher data volumes that missions are expected to require the contact data rates are increased from the current hundreds of Mbps to more than one Gbps The resulting scenario consists of a set of 15 missions from NASA NOAA and USGS The NASA Earth observation community has eight missions using the network 2 of them being major drivers 050e.g a DESDYNI class mission 2 more being medium sized missions and 4 more being smallsats A mission becomes a driver for the network if its required data rate at least doubles the capabilities of the current TDRSS and the total desired data volume is greater than 10Tbit/day On the other hand the NASA astrophysics and heliophysics community are represented through 4 missions one of which is considered to be a driver and the other three are medium sized missions These medium sized missions typically return 030 1Tbit/day Similarly the human space\003ight stakeholder is considered to have 2 missions in orbit one similar to the International Space Station 050ISS\051 and another one representative of a MultiPurpose Crew Vehicle 050MPCV\051 capsule The ISS-like is a driver both in terms of required scheduled time 050continuous contact throughout the day is required\051 and data volume In turn the MPCV-like missions only requires support for a long continuous periods of time 050 030 5 hours\051 Finally the NOAA and USGS mission are also included in the scenario but are expected to be users of the system In this case it is assumed that they will use the network for contingency situations and therefore will schedule a maximum of two 5 to 10 minute contacts For each of the described mission at least two types of service are included a science return service and a telemetry tracking and command 050TT&C\051 service Additionally the human space\003ight missions also have high de\002nition 050HD\051 video services required As a result the mission scenario has a total of 213 required contacts per day that account for 115 hours of total schedulable time and a total data volume of 130Tbit/day Payload band selection and allocation The payload band selection and allocation problem looks at what are the best frequency bands to be included in the system and how to best allocate them in relay satellites In order to provide a stable comparison this study assumes that all satellites are procured and then operated by NASA Figure 3 presents the obtained tradespace and 003ags the set of architectures that achieve the best performance for a given total life cycle cost 050LCC\051 These architectures have the following characteristics 1  Monolithic architecture with one single access antenna 050SA\051 per satellite supporting only S-band 2  Monolithic architecture with one SA per satellite supporting S Ku and Ka-bands simultaneously 3  Monolithic architecture with two SA per satellite one supporting S-band and the other one supporting Ku and Kaband 4  Monolithic architecture with two SA per satellite one supporting Ku and Ka-band and the other one supporting S Ku and Ka-band simultaneously 5  Disaggregated architecture with 3 satellites carrying two SA antennas one supporting S-band and the other one supporting Ku and Ka-band and 3 more satellites carrying two SA antennas one supporting Ku and Ka-band and the other one supporting optical communications Based on the analysis of the overall tradespace the following conclusions can be drawn First an all optical architecture achieves a very low score in bene\002t 0500.1 approximately\051 but is potentially less expensive than most only RF and RF/optical architectures This is because the mission scenario used for this simulation only included two missions with data rates high enough 050  1Gbps\051 that they required optical communications Second the incremental value of having Sband for TT&C services is approximately 40 of the bene\002t Similarly having K-band for science data return services provides an extra 50 to 55 of the bene\002t Third the current TDRSS architecture is able to provide approximately 84 of the total bene\002t although the same level of performance can be obtained with the less costly architecture 4 050of the previous list\051 Finally architectures that obtain maximum bene\002t sup9

Figure 4  Payload Allocation Figure 5  Procurement vs Hosted Payloads Hosted payloads vs 100 procurement This case study focuses on the impact of including hosted payloads as part of the system Figure 5 presents an extended representation of the tradespace where hosted payload architectures are included The 002rst immediate conclusion that can be drawn is that based on the cost model from hosted payloads offer the possibility of signi\002cant cost reductions 050between 15 and 30%\051 As a result all architectures on the Pareto front rely on hosted payload architectures On the other hand concerns about using hosted payload assets for critical applications like astronaut support have been 003agged as a major caveat In this case an optimal solution would entail using a portfolio of hosted payloads and privately owned satellites and schedule the communications through ones or the others according to operational constraints Therefore building this portfolio can be done by analyzing what communication payloads are better suited for hosted payload con\002gurations Figure 6 presents the tradespace of architectures that mix hosted payload and procured assets Results indicate that including hosted payload assets in the system does not have a major impact on its performance but requires disaggregating the monolithic satellites identi\002ed as optimal in the previous case study That being the case the next questions arise Figure 6  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets Which payload obtains better savings when being hosted How many payloads do you want to 003y in a hosted payload approach The answer for the 002rst question can be obtained by analyzing the non-dominated architectures from 002gure 6 and estimating the cost savings when hosting the different types of antennas that are considered in this analysis Results indicate that hosting an optical payload can potentially save an 28 of the cost while a low data rate antenna 050S-band\051 only obtains a 16 cost reduction 050note that these numbers are based on the system life-cycle cost and are heavily in\003uenced by the hosted payload cost model\051 Therefore it seems to be more advisable to put high data rate payloads like optical terminals in commercial satellites and retain control of S-band communications 050which in turn ensures that contingency event will be addressed by privately owned assets not constrained by the operational limitations of host platforms\051 Finally 002gure 7 presents the tradespace of hosted payload architectures color coded by the number of antennas that are being hosted By looking at the Pareto front it can be seen that almost all architectures host one single antenna as opposed to two in order to minimize the burden on the host platform This burden is also contingent on the mass and power of the hosted communication payload This is the main reason why optical terminals become so attractive for hosted payload architectures as opposed to low frequency systems that require big parabolic antennas and power ampli\002ers to close the link budgets 6 C ONCLUSION Summary This paper has presented the 002rst set of results obtained through the developed architectural tool to evaluate space communication networks It has 002rst provided a high level overview of the tool with a description of four main constitutive elements An STK model an architecture generator an architecture evaluator and a resource manager Next it has described the newly developed scheduling algorithm based on a rule-based expert system that ef\002ciently allocates the network resources to satisfy near-Earth mission communication requirements Then a discussion on the conducted validation exercise has 11 


Figure 7  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets been presented in order to gain some level of con\002dence on the results that the tool outputs This discussion has focused on the validation of the scheduling algorithm by benchmarking it with operational schedules from the TDRSS Finally this paper has presented two case studies for future implementations of the TDRSS system Based on a demand forecast for the network a 002rst case study has considered the problem of selecting the frequency band to be supported and how to allocate them into the relay satellites It has been shown that maximum performance architectures require a mix of optical and RF payloads that support high throughput communications as well as reliable low data rate communications If the traditional procurement strategy is assumed 050NASA buys and operates the relay satellites\051 then monolithic architectures are preferable unless more than two high gain antennas render the resulting satellite con\002guration too complex In turn the second case study has extended this analysis by introducing architectures with hosted payloads It has been shown that according to the current available pricing model hosted payload architectures are clearly preferable than the traditional procurement strategy with cost savings between 15 to 30 for the same level of system performance It has then been discussed the advantages of having mixed procured and hosted payload architectures as a compromise to obtain networks with reduced lifecycle costs that can still address the requirements of highly sensitive and reliable applications Results have demonstrated that high data rate payloads 050speci\002cally optical payloads\051 are the best candidates to be hosted 050with savings up to 28%\051 thanks to their reduced mass and power requirement On the other hand low data rate communication payload should be allocated in privately owned satellites as they require bigger antennas and power ampli\002ers that increase the burden on the host platform Future Work The main streams of future work are as twofold On one hand additional features should be added to the model in order to better capture the complexity of the network con\002gurations 050e.g coupling between the costs of the communication payloads depending on the level of on-orbit processing the they perform\051 Additionally the size of the tradespace is currently limited to less than two thousand architectures due to computational limitations a stringent limitation given the possible combinations from the identi\002ed architectural decisions The solution currently under development is to include a genetic algorithm that alleviates this problem by iteratively generates new populations of architectures by combining the best previously evaluated networks On the other hand the other main stream of future work is related to exercising the tool in a variety of architectural decisions and mission scenarios In the presented case studies only geosynchronous constellations were considered although the tool allows comparing them with systems that place relays in MEO and LEO orbits Additionally the tool can also provide insight in valuing inter-satellite links and how the cost of putting in orbit their extra communication payloads can be leveraged by reducing the number of operating ground stations Moreover couplings between the payload allocation and fractionation strategy should also be further explored so as to understand if monolithic architectures still become preferable if relay satellites can be decomposed in clusters of independent antennas and payloads Finally supplementary what-if analysis can be conducted based on 0501\051 the demand forecast for the 2020-2030 time frame 0502\051 granted spectrum allocations to NASA and 0503\051 technology improvements that increase the spectral ef\002ciency of the communication payloads 12
