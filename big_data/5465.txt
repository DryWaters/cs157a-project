TOP-MATA: A Max-First Traversal Method for Top-? Cosine Similarity Search Shiwei Zhu1, Junjie Wu2, Guoping Xia3, Limin Li4 1,2,3School of Economics and Management, Beihang University, Beijing, China 1sherwinzhu@buaa.edu.cn 2wujj@buaa.edu.cn 3gxia@buaa.edu.cn 4Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Shanghai, China\(limin920@gmail.com ABSTRACT Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in computing cosine similarities between documents \(or commodities Most previous studies require the speci?cation of a minimum similarity threshold to perform cosine similarity search. However, it is usually dif?cult for users to provide an appropriate threshold in practice. Instead, in this paper, we propose to search top-? strongly related pairs of objects as measured by the cosine similarity. Speci?cally, we rst de?ne the cosine similarity measure from the association analysis point of view and identify the monotone property of an upper bound of the cosine measure, then exploit a Max-First traversal strategy for developing the TOP-MATA algorithm. Compared with previous TOP-DATA method, TOP-MATA has the advantage of saving the computations for falsepositive item pairs. Finally experimental results demonstrate the computational ef?ciency of the algorithm Keywords: Cosine Similarity, Interestingness Measure, Anti-Monotone Property, Association Analysis 1. Introduction Since the introduction of the association rules in the early nineties of the last century [1], association analysis has become one of the core problems in data mining and database communities. When facing a large set of items \(objects and the observation data about co-occurring items, association analysis is concernedwith the identi?cation of strongly related subsets of items. It plays an important role in many application ?elds such as market-basket analysis [2 and bioinformatics [3, 4]. Although numerous scalable methods have been developed for mining frequent patterns in association analysis, the support and con?dence framwork, however, may not disclose truly interesting relationships [5]. Let us demonstrate this by the following wellknown example [6] in Table 1 Tab. 1: A Tea-Coffee Example Coffee Co?ee Tea 15 5 20 Tea 75 5 80 


90 10 100 According to the table, we can ?nd an association rule Tea} ? {coffee} with a reasonably high con?dence value: 75%. This rule implies that people who drink tea will more likely drink coffee, which indeed is NOT true Now, note that the fraction of coffee drinkers, regardless of whether they drink tea, is 90%. In contrast, the fraction of tea drinkers who also drink coffee is only 75%. In other words, knowing that a person who drink tea actually decreases his/her probability of being a coffee drinker from 90% to 75%! Therefore, the support-con?dent framework is actually not suitable for this usual case. To meet this critic challenge, many objective interestingness measures have been proposed or borrowed for mining truly interesting rules, such as ???? and ?2 [7], all-con?dence, coherence, and cosine [8]. Most of these studies, however, require the setting of a minimum similarity threshold which is actually a real challenge for users in practice. More importantly, many applications and search engines require the rankings of the item subsets instead To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Max-First traversal algorithm named TOP-MATA to search for the top-? cosine similarity item pairs. TOP-MATA can utilize the monotone property of the cosine upper bound so as to ef?ciently prune item pairs without computing their exact cosine values. In addition, TOP-MATA has the ability that can avoid the computations of cosine values for false-positive item pairs. Finally, we conduct experiments on various real-world data sets. Results reveal that, compared with the brute-forth method and TOP-DATA algorithm, TOP-MATA algorithm shows overwhelming computational advantages for ?nding top-? item pairs RelatedWork: A key problem of using the interestingness measures is the lack of the monotonicity, which makes it dif?cult to incorporate the measures directly into the existing mining algorithms. Under this circumstance, Xiong et al. inspiringly introduced an upper bound function to the ?-coef?cient, and proposed the TAPER algorithm [9 Ilyas et al. \(2004  ciently identifying correlated pairs, which applied the sampling techniques. Zhang \(2006  ple randomized algorithm whose false-negative probability 


is negligible. Since it is often dif?cult for users to provide an appropriate correlation threshold, Xiong et al. [12] proposed the TOP-COP algorithm to ef?ciently compute the top-? correlated pairs Outline: The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduce the cosine similarity measure and traversal method. Section 3 proposes the TOP-MATA algorithm. Experimental results are presented in Section 4 Finally, we draw the conclusion in Section 5 2. Basic Concepts and Problem De?nition Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two high-dimensional vectors. In essence, it is the cosine value of the angle between two vectors. That is, given two vectors 978-1-4244-6487-6/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE and cos   1 where ? indicates the dot product of the vectors, and indicates the length of the vector. A cosine similarity value always lies in the range of [0, 1], where 1 indicates a perfect match of two vectors, whereas 0 indicates an entire difference From a support measure point of view adopted by the frequent pattern mining, the cosine similarity for binary pairs can be further transformed equivalently to a support form as follows cos    2 2.1. The Upper Bound and Its Monotonicity For two items ? and ? , without loss of generality, we assume  the support measure, the number of co-occurrences of and ? must be no more than the number of occurrences of or ? alone. That is  Accordingly     


        3 Thus we get an upper bound for cos cos    4 Further we formulate the property of the upper bound Theorem 1 Given two items ? and ? with  cos in  Suppose we have ? items: {?1, ?2, ? ? ? , ??}. We ?rst sort the items in descending order of their support values  sequence 1], ?[2], ? ? ? , ?[?]}, \(5 where  Based on the sorted item-sequence, we can build a twodimensional Sorted Item-Matrix  as shown by Figure 1 with ? = 6. Note that since the cosine similarity is symmetric, we only need to consider the upper triangle matrix For the pairs in the Sorted Item-Matrix, there exists the Monotonicity mentioned above in rows or in columns which can be called 2-D Monotonicity 2.2. Problem De?nition and Traversal Method Now, suppose we have ? different items in a data set, each of which is characterized by a binary vector. We then X[1 X[2 X[3 X[4 X[5 


X[6 X[1] X[2] X[3] X[4] X[5] X[6 Fig. 1: The Sorted Item-Matrix: An Example formulate our problem as follows PROBLEM DEFINITION. Given itemset 1, ?2, ? ? ? , ??} where each item is represented by a binary vector, ?nd ? pairs of items whose cosine similarity values are among the top-? ones For solving this problem, we can build and maintain the list of the binary pairs with top-? cosine similarity values hereafter we call them the top-? pairs for simplicity during the computation. The rule for the update of the top? list is as follows: 1 binary pair; 2 of the current top-? pairs, the new pair should replace the minimum pair Apparently, the cost of the direct way that computes the values for all ?\(? ? 1 typically very high. And this can be even worse if ? becomes extremely large  too large to be loaded into the main memory  indeed this is a usual case for a market basket data set. So the ?rst point is to alleviate the computational cost by exploiting the upper bound of cosine similarity. Let ?????? denote the minimum cosine value of the pairs in the current top-? list, we have two simple theorems as follows Theorem 2 \(The Filtering Effect can enter the top-? list only if  Theorem 3 \(The Pruning Effect list and its ??????, for pairs in sorted item-matrix, if   The above theorems points out that the upper bound can be used to ef?ciently ?lter and prune item-pairs in the sorted item-matrix. According to 2, for any new pair if   Otherwise, we simply skip this pair without computing  upper bound. According to 3, if ?[?,?] cannot enter the top? list due to its small upper bound, then ?[?,?] will also fail 


to do that given ? ? ? and Instead of the brute force traversal method, TAPEK-TOPK [12] and TOP-DATA[13] are two ef?cient methods to nd the top-? pairs, whose key point is the use of the upper bound of cosine similarity and its monotone property. The TAPEK-TOP-K method traverse the item pairs row by row, from top to bottom, from left to right, in the item-matrix. And the TOP-DATA method conducts a diagonal traversal in the item-matrix. The search starts from the principal diagonal, then goes to the diagonal above the main diagonal, and so on. Previous studies have shown that the TOP-DATA method is more ef?cient than the TAPEKTOP-K method 3. The Max-First Traverse Algorithm In this section, we revisit the top-? cosine similarity computation problem, and propose TOP-MATA \(Top cOsine similarity Pairs using MAx-?rst TrAverse method for very large-scale data sets 3.1. The Max-First Traversal Procedure The max-?rst traversal procedure also takes use of the sorted item-matrix. Roughly speaking, it is an iterative procedure. In each iteration, it selects one row in the upper triangular matrix to check whether there is any pair that can enter the top-? list. Two points should be addressed here First, the selection criterion is max-?rst; that is, the row containing the item pair with the maximum cosine upper bound will be selected Second, one checking is not for one pair only, but includes all the pairs in the same row that have the same maximum upper bound value The whole iteration process will be suspended if the maximum upper bound is no greater than??????, i.e., the minimum cosine value of the current top-? pairs. In what follows, we illustrate the pseudocode of TOP-MATA 3.2. The Pseudocode of TOP-MATA Fig. 2 shows the pseudocode of TOP-MATA. In Line 3 to 6, we initialize a max-heap data structure named to store the up-to-date maximum cosine upper bound of each row in the sorted matrix. It is trivial to note that the maximum cosine upper bound of each row is exactly the one of the left-most pair remained unchecked in this row \(recall the monotonicity of the upper bound 


the use of a max-heap is for the purpose of speeding up the selection of the row with the maximum upper bound as show in Line 7 Line 8 to 23 are for the iterative process. We ?rst check whether the maximum upper bound???????? we ?nd is larger than?????? in Line 8. If not, we stop the iterations and return the current top-? pairs as the ?nal result in Line 24. Otherwise, we proceed to check whether the pairs with can enter the top-? list. Line 12-14 are to ?nd all the pairs with the same upper bound ????????, from to ?[?,???1 ]. Then we ?nd the TID-lists of the items in these pairs for the computations of 2-item supports, and check whether these pairs can enter the top-? list by computing their exact cosine values By procedure Re?neTopKPairs. It is noteworthy that we employ the Vertical Data Layout [14] to facilitate the computation of 2-item supports for cosine similarity. That is, for an item pair, we 1: procedure TOP-DATA 2: ?????? = ?1, ? =Size 3: for ? = 0 to ? ? 2 do // initialize pairUpperHeap 4: ? = ?+ 1    5: Add {?, ?, ?????} to 6: end for 7 8: while ???????? ? ?????? do 9: ? = row index of 10: ?? = column index of 11: ?? = item index whose support is less then ??th item 12: for ? = ?? to ?? ? 1 do 13: Re?neTopKPairs 14: end for 15    16: if ????? > ?????? then 17 18: else 19: ?????????????.???? = {?, ?,?1 20: end if 


21: Heapify the max-heap of 22 23: end while 24: return 25: end procedure 1: procedure REFINETOPKPAIRS 2: Get the 3    4: if ??? > ?????? then 5: Update ????????? by 6: end if 7: end procedure Fig. 2: The TOP-MATA Algorithm search the vertical data layout for the transaction identi?er list \(TID-list by intersecting the TID-lists of the two items Finally, Line 15-22 are for the update of the max-heap That is, we should update the maximum upper bound for the row we checked above. According to the monotonicity of the upper bound, the next pair unchecked, i.e., ?[?,??] is the candidate. If the cosine upper bound of ?[?,??] is greater than ??????, then it can be added to the max-heap to update the root, i.e., the checked ?[?,??]; otherwise, we only need to disable the root and will not check this row any more. Line 22 is to ?nd the new ???????? after the update of the max-heap 3.3. Avoiding the False-Positive Pair Computations Here, we further explore the characteristics of TOP-MATA Indeed, compared with TOP-DATA, TOP-MATA can avoid the computations of cosine values for false-positive pairs the pairs that have upper bounds greater than the current but smaller than or equal to the optimal threshold, i.e., the minimum cosine value of the ?nal top-? pairs which we do not know during the computational process Let ? denote the optimal threshold, we have the following theorem Theorem 4 In the max-?rst procedure of TOP-MATA given the item pair ? to be checked and ?????? of the current top-? list, we have   


6 PROOF: It is trivial to note that so the necessary condition is obvious. It remains to prove the suf?cient condition. We use the proof by contradiction If  7 Since the?????? is smaller than ?, there must be at least one unchecked item pair that should enter the ?nal top? list. However, according to the max-?rst rule of TOPMATA    8 where ? is any item pair in the sorted matrix that remains unchecked yet. This implies that there will be no more item pair that can enter the top-? list due to the ?ltering effect of the upper bound. This contradicts the above result. So we complete the proof Remark. Theorem 4 implies that althoughwe cannot know before we get the ?nal top-? list, the max-?rst strategy can still guide us out of the pool of false-positive pairs as if we know ? already. This can further save the computational time of TOP-MATA 3.4.

In this example, we use a simulated data set which contains 20 transactions and 8 items, as shown in Tab. 2\(a b the item pairs computed in a brute-force fashion Suppose that we want to ?nd top-3 item pairs. First, we sort the items into a sequence {?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?} by the their supports in the descending order, and then form the sorted item-matrix in Fig. 3.

The Performance Comparison In this subsection, we would like to study the effectiveness of the max-?rst traversal strategy for real-world data sets First, as can be seen in Fig. 4, due to the ?ltering effect of the upper bound and the pruning effect of the max-?rst traversal procedure, TOP-MATA consumes much less execution time than the brute-force method. This is particularly true for small ? values.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
