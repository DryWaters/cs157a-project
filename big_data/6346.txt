Applying Multidimensional Association Rule Mining to Feedback-based Recommendation Systems  Yin-Fu Huang Dept. of Computer Sci. and Information Eng National Yunlin University of Science & Technology Touliu Yunlin, Taiwan huangyf@yuntech.edu.tw San-Des Lin Dept. of Computer Sci. and Information Eng National Yunlin University of Science & Technology Touliu Yunlin, Taiwan g9517723@yuntech.edu.tw   Abstract  The main characteristic of collaborative filtering is to provide personalized recommendations to a customer based on the customer profile, without considering content information about domain items. In this paper, we 
investigated to use a relevance feedback mechanism in the collaborative recommendation system. First, we used the Self-organizing Map \(SOM\ method to avoid suffering from the scalability and sparsity problem in the collaborative filtering. In addition, we adopted the Statistical Attribute Distance \(SAD\method which uses the similarity in statistics of customersê ratings to calculate customer correlations instead of using the statistics of customers that rate for similar items. Then, the multi-tier granule mining algorithm was used to find association rule s. Finally, with the relevance feedback mechanism and the association rules, the 
recommendations could be refined to provide customers more relevance information Keywords-recommended systems; collaborative filtering association rule mining; information retrieval; relevance feedback I   I NTRODUCTION  Recommender systems are online information systems that recommend products to customers. There are two major types of recommender systems: 1\ content-based one and 2\ collaborative filtering one. In general, a collaborative filtering system has two major advantages over a content-based one; i.e., it does not take into account content information, and it is simpler and easier to 
implement [1 A c o ll abo r at iv e f ilt er in g sy stem  m aintain s customersê judgments on the relevance of data items. Then it exploits these judgments to predict the item relevance to customers. In other words it recommends relevant information to customers based on the similarity between customer profiles [2, 3  Rel e vance f e e d b a ck is a f e atu re of  some information retrieval systems. It is an online learning technique used to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval. The concept of relevance feedback is to let a customer be involved in the system and guide the system The customer interacts with the system and rates the relevance of retrieved items during the retrieval process With the additional feedback information, the system 
dynamically learns the customer preferences, and gradually presents better result  In this paper, we proposed a collaborative filtering framework divided into two phases. In the offline phase we did data generalization which consists of the movie clustering on the mn 002 representation and the neighborhood aggregation on the nm 002  representation of an input dataset where n is the number of customers and m  is the number of movies \(or rating data\. Then, we used association rule mining [5 to  extr act ru l e in f o rm ati on  and  
stored them in the rule base. In the online phase, rule information aided a preliminary recommendation afterward, the relevance feed back mechanism improved further recommendations based on the explicit interaction from customers The remainder of the paper is organized as follows The collaborative filtering framework which combines several methods is proposed in Section 2. Section 3 presents the experimental results. Finally, we make conclusions in Section 4 II  S YSTEM A RCHITECTURE  A  Overview 
The basic goal of a collaborative filtering system is to recommend items to a target customer based on other customers profiles. As shown in Fig. 1, a collaborative filtering framework which combined several methods was proposed to reach the goal. In the offline phase, we did data generalization which consists of the movie clustering on the mn 002 representation and the neighborhood aggregation on the nm 002 representation of an input dataset where n is the number of customers and m is the number of movies \(or rating data\ Then, we used association rule 
mining to extract rule information, and stored them in the rule base. In the online phase, rule information aided a preliminary recommendation; afterward, the relevance feedback mechanism improved further recommendations based on the explicit interaction from customers  Figure 1.

sparsity problems [6-9 w e us ed th e s e l f o rg anizing map \(SOM\method [10 to solv e t h ese proble m s In general, the Euclidean distance is often used to calculate SOM similarity, but in this case, we used the Tanimoto coefficient \(extended Jaccard coefficient\ulate the similarity. The reason is that in our dataset, given two binary grade vectors X a 0, 0, 1, 0 and X b 0, 1, 0, 0  the 0-0 pair represents the sa me rating for the Euclidean distance, but rating 0 means that customers have never seen or no opinions about the movie so the 0-0 pair cannot be treated as the same rating. The Tanimoto coefficient is expressed as follows 003\004 22  AB TAB ABAB 005 006\007 B B 1  where    denotes the dot product of the two vectors  In the dataset MovieLens, there are totally 1682 movies with 19 genres such as action, adventure, animation, et al  and each movie may belong to more than one genre Finally, we cluster these movies into 14 clusters and label them with the genres mentioned above. In a cluster, we can calculate how many genres a movie belongs to on average If the average genre number in a cluster is k   we would choose topk 010\011 012\013 frequent labels as the dominant ones of the cluster 2  Neighborhood aggregation A collaborative filtering system is to predict the preference of a target customer to a given item based on the information of customers  preference items. The database to be calculated would record the similarity between a target customer and a group of like-minded ones. The system utilizes statistical techniques to find a group of likeminded customers as neighbor s, which have records of agreeing with the target customer [8 th e pap e r w e  adopted the Statistical Attribute Distance \(SAD\ method 11 w h ich uses the similarity in statistics of customers ratings to calculate the customer correlation instead of using the statistics of customers that rate for similar items In the following SAD formula W\(a, i is the correlation measure between customer a and customer i  where SV a,i,j indicates the weighted correlation for the rating to item j from customer a and customer i and k  represents the number of items rated by both customer a  and customer i When the preference scores of customer a  and custom i corresponding to item j are higher than their respective average preference scores of all items, it employs part s j whereas the preference scores of customer a and custom i corresponding to the item j are lower than their respective average preference scores of all items, it employs part s j,; otherwise, it employs the third part. Within the formulas s j,r is expressed as  1   jr j nn 007  where n j is the total number of rating to item j and n j,r is the number of rating  r  to item j The concepts behind s j,r  come from the well-known information retrieval technique  Inverse Document Frequency \(IDF\. In IDF, a word is considered less important if it occurs commonly among all the documents 003\004 a,i,j j SV Wa,i k 005 014 2  where 003\004 003\004            100 100 aj ij j aj ij ai j a j i j j a j i j aj ij rv rv s if rv andrv SV rv rv s if rv andrv rv rv otherwise 015 015 006 007 016 002\002\006\002 017 017 020 020 005\002\002\006\002 021 021 022 020 020 007\002 023 3   aj aj a rv v v 005\007    ij ij i rv v v 005\007 4 In the dataset MovieLens, there is the rating information from 943 users against 1682 movies. In the neighborhood aggregation, we would finally find 100 likeminded customers as neighbors for each target customer In other words, each target customer has his/her personalized neighbors that indirectly provide recommendation information for references C  Association Rule Mining 1  Normalization model Before we used the multitier granule mining algorithm to find association rules from the reduced dimensional representation we have to do some data transformations ac cording to the results of movie clustering and neighborhood aggregations After clustering the movies, rather than viewing a movie as a rating unit, we considered a movie cluster for the later processing. For the example as shown in Fig. 2\(a this is 100 neighbors of a target customer where there are 10 movies in Cluster1 and customers C1 and C2 rate 5 movies and 4 movies in this cluster, respectively. The rating grade could be in the range of {1  5}, and 0 represents that customers do not rate. Suppose customers C1 and C2 are verified as reasonable, and then we calculate the average rating of the cluster for C1 and C2 i.e., \(1+2+3+5+3\5=2.8 is for C1 and \(4+5+2+3\/4=3.5 is for C2. Finally, we did the binary conversion as shown in Fig. 2\(b\ where the average ratings greater than 3 are viewed as favors and represented as 1; otherwise, as 0          Figure 2. Rating lists 2  Multi-tier granule mining algorithm In this section we used the multi-tier granule mining algorithm [12 to  find association rules from the reduced dimensional representation Basically, knowledge discovery methods are not efficient to represent the associations in a large multidimensional database. Although some researchers divided a large number of attributes into two groups condition attributes and decision attributes as decision 
413 


tables it is still inefficient be cause it cannot describe the association rules with multi-tiers. To solve these drawbacks above, the multi-tier granule mining presented the multi-tier structures for managing the associations between attributes and the concepts of granule mining for a multidimensional database. In summary, it divides attributes into some tiers, an d then compresses a large multidimensional database into granules at each tier and constructs multi-tier structures Hence, the multi-tier granule mining has two phrases: 1 dividing attributes into tiers, and 2\ compressing the database into granules at each tier and constructing multitier structures. The phase of dividing attributes into tiers was illustrated as shown in Fig. 3. Let the example in  Fig 2\(b\ be reproduced in Fig. 3, where only the ratings of customer 1 and customer 2 against 5 clusters of movies are shown, and 1, 0, x represent favor, not-favor, don  t care respectively. In Step 1, we took these 5 clusters of movies  cluster 1 cluster 2 cluster 3 cluster 4 cluster 5 as items \(or attributes\ In Step 2, we grouped 4 clusters of them into C  as condition attributes of which the preferences are more than or equal to the average preference 30, and the reminder formed D as decision attributes of which the preference is less than the average preference. In Step 3 the condition attributes were further divided into two tiers i.e., 1\ the members of C i tier of which the preferences are more than or equal to the av erage preference 32.5, and 2 the members of C j tier of which the preferences are less than the average preference. Finally, the clusters were classified into three tiers high preference C i tier  medium preference C j tier and low preference D-tier             Figure 3. Dividing attributes into tiers The phrase of compressing the database into granules at each tier and constructing multi-tier structures was illustrated as shown in Fig. 4, where constructing multi-tier structures was according to Algorithm [12  T h e ru l es th a t  we would mine here consist of decision rules and general rules as follows Decision rules      ixjy z ixjxz ixjy cg cg dg conf cg cg dg cg cg 010\011\010\011 024\025 005 024\024 024 026\027\026\027 0041  General rules with shorter premises    ix z ix z ix cg dg conf cg dg cg 010\011\010\011 025\005\024 026\027\026\027 0041              Figure 4. Compressing the database into granules at each tier and constructing multi-tier structures In the example, we assumed the count values of threegranule predicates as follows 1 1 1 1 1 3 2 2 2 2 3 2 3 1 2 3 3 1 3 4 3 5 1 4 ij ij ij ij ij ij cg cg dg cg cg dg cg cg dg cg cg dg cg cg dg cg cg dg 010\011\010\011 024\024 005 024\024 005 026\027\026\027 010\011\010\011 024\024 005 024\024 005 026\027\026\027 010\011\010\011 024\024 005 024\024 005 026\027\026\027  the count values of two-granule predicates as follows 1 1  2  2 2 3 3 1 3 3 1 1 1 3  2 2 3 1 3 2 7 3 5 1 43 4 8 4 1 ij i j ij ij ij i ii ii cg cg cg cg cg cg cg cg cg cg cg dg cg dg cg dg cg dg cg dg 010\011\010 011 024\005 024 005 026\027\026 027 010\011\010\011 024\005 024\005 026\027\026\027 010\011 010\011 024\005 024\005 026\027 026\027 010\011\010 011 024\005 024\005 026\027\026 027 010\011\010 011 024\005 024 005 026\027\026 027  the count values of one-granule predicates as follows 1  2 3 7 8 5 iii cg cg cg 010\011 010 011 010\011 005\005\005 026\027 026 027 026\027  When finding rules, a rule  ix jy z cg cg dg 024\025 is called meaningless and should be removed if its confidence is less than or equal to the confidence of its general rule  ix z cg dg 025 As a result, we found the following rules Decision rules 3 1 2 1   1.0 1 ij cg cg dg conf 024\025 005\005  3 3 1 4   1.0 4 ij cg cg dg conf 024\025 005\005  General rules with shorter premises

The order of the association rules determines the quality of recommendations. In general, recommendations should be concise and with high predictive power. Here, we adopted the length-first strategy to rank the association rules in the rule base [13  Specifically, the length-first rule-ranking strategy is as follows 1  Rank rules according to their lengths. The shorter the rules, the higher the priorities. Rules should be as concise as possible 2  If two rules have the same length, rank them according to their confidence values. The greater the confidence values, the higher the priorities. Since more-confident rules have more predictive power, they should have higher priorities 3  If two rules have the same confidence values, rank them according to their support values. The higher the support values, the higher the priorities. Since the rules with higher support values are more statistically significant, they should have higher priorities 4  If two rules have the same support values, rank them at will D  Recommendation Systems In the online phase, the recommendation system would provide Top-N recommendations for a target customer These recommendations could be changed according to the feedback from the target customer. In the relevance feedback mechanism, the system received relevance feedback and then employed it to refine the recommendations in order to provide the customer more relevance information. The idea of the relevance feedback mechanism comes from the online video recommendation 1 H o w e ver w e alt e r e d th e usage of relev ance feedback such that relevance feedback was used to adjust the intraranking within each cluster and the inter-ranking among different clusters. For the customer judgment on a recommended list, the items could be marked as favored ones \(i.e., success recommenda tions\ which were called  positive  items. On the contrary, those unmarked items were viewed as not-favored ones \(i.e., failed recommendations\ which were called  negative  items Then, we took these  positive  and  negative  items as relevance feedback to adjust the intra-ranking and interranking The intra-ranking adjustment is to re-rank the movies in a cluster according to their updated similarity values We calculated the similarity values based on the 19 k 002  representation where k is the number of movies in a cluster and 19 is the total number of genres. The similarity between each movie and  positive  items \(or  negative   items\ the same cluster was calculated using the Euclidean distance. The movies more similar to  positive   items would be ranked in the upper part, whereas the movies more similar to  negative  items would be ranked in the lower part The inter-ranking adjustment is to obtain the new recommendation ratio of each related cluster. When  negative  items were indicated not to appear in the next recommendation, the same number of new movies should be recommended from related clusters. For the related cluster i the number of new recommended movies could be calculated as follows 1 i i N j j V New n V 005 005\002 014 5 where    0  jj j j j Pos Neg if Pos Neg V otherwise 007\030 016 005 022 023 6 n is the number of new movies to appear in the next recommendation N is the number of related clusters Pos j  and Neg j are the number of positive and negative movies in the related cluster j respectively The procedure of the relevance feedback mechanism is shown in Fig. 5. Firstly, a customer selected favored movies as input and the mechanism would give an initial Top-N recommended list back to the customer according to the measurement of similar genres as the intra-ranking and the default inter-ranking. Then, it adjusted the intraranking and inter-ranking based on the  positive  and  negative  movies from customer feedback. Finally, it recommended new Top-N movies according to the updated inter-ranking and intra-ranking. The procedure was repeated till the customer was satisfied with the recommended list  Figure 5. Procedure of relevance feedback mechanism III  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  A  Dataset Here, the dataset MovieLens was used in the experiments. It is a set of ratings to movies, which debuted in 1997 for a web-based research recommendation system 
415 


The dataset MovieLens contains 100,000 ratings of 1,682 movies from 943 customers. The customers rated each movie with from 1 to 5 \(0 indicates null\. In the experiments, we only considered the customers that rated more than or equal to 20 movies. First, we converted the original ratings into the preferences as mentioned in Section 2.3.1. To reflect a customer  s preference level each rating was converted into 1 if it is greater than the average rating; otherwise, into 0. Besides, we invited 10 evaluators majoring in computer sciences, and each rating profile of these evaluators would be used in the experiments after they rated the movies in MovieLens B  Experimental Metrics In order to observe the effectiveness of our recommendation system, a new metric called mean ranking difference  MRD was defined and measured in the experiments MRD measuring the average ranking difference between the most relevant ranking and the current recommended list is expressed as follows 1  TopN i i RankDiff MRD TopN TopN 1 005 002\007 014 7 where ii i  RelRank CurRank  if hit RankDiff TopN 1,                      otherwise 007 016 005 022 007 023  8 RelRank i is the position of the ith hit movie in the most relevant ranking CurRank i is the position of the ith hit movie in the current recommended list, and TopN is the number of recommendations provided by the system. For those non-hit movies, their ranking differences are all set to the maximum interval TopN-1 Besides, the term TopN1 in the formula is also used to normalize the MRD value in the range of [0, 1   T h u s  w h en th e cur r ent h it n u m ber is  not more than the last hit number, the MRD value would keep the same value as the last one. If the MRD value is not changed for three times, the test would stop; in other words, the system is unable to improve the recommendations again C  User Interface In the experiments, we realized a user-friendly interface for the feedback-based recommendation system which not only provides customers to communicate with the retrieval subsystem, but also enables them to judge the recommendations. As shown in Fig. 6, the user interface consists of three areas: 1\ customer operating area providing customers 18 genres to select, 2\ recommended movie area - providing customers three kinds of Top-N  recommendations \(i.e Top-5  Top-10 and Top-15 and 3 textual description area  providing customers related movie descriptions D  Results and Discussions In the experiments, these 10 testers were evaluated using 5 samples under different Top-N Here, only the MRD values of tester-2 under different Top-N are shown in Fig. 7. For sample 1 as shown in Fig. 7\(a\, the system only responded to one feedback and then satisfied tester-2  quickly. For sample 2 and sample 5 as shown in Fig. 7\(a since no hit movies were found in the initial recommended list, their MRD values were all 1 in the figure. Afterwards through the last three times of feedbacks, their MRD  values still kept the same and they could not reach the most satisfied level. Then, we thought that the system was unable to improve their recommendations again. There might be some causes leading to these results: 1\ the personalized self-awareness, 2\ less Top-N than demanded or 3\ related clusters had not enough movies to recommend For sample 3 and sample 4 as shown in Fig. 7\(a\, they could reach the most satisfied level normally. Similarly the results for Top-10 and Top-15 are shown in Fig. 7\(b and Fig. 7\(c\. However, it seems, for tester-2 more Top-N would lead to reaching the most satisfied level  Figure 6. User interface   Figure 7\(a MRD values for Top-5     Figure 7\(b MRD values for Top-10   
416 


 Figure 7\(c MRD values for Top-15   At the same time, we also observed the average feedback times as shown in Fig. 8\(a\ and the average precision as shown in Fig. 8\(b\, among these 10 testers. As shown in Fig. 8\(a\, for most cases, the more Top-N was the more the feedback times were. Besides, as shown in Fig. 8\(b\, the precision of different Top-N was a little diverse among 10 testers. Nevertheless, they almost reached more than 90% precision, especially two of third reaching the most satisfied level \(i.e., 100  Figure 8\(a\. Feedback times for different Top-N     Figure 8\(b\. Precision for different Top-N   IV  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed a feedback-based recommendation system. First, data generalization consisting of the movie clustering and the neighborhood aggregation was done. Next, after doing normalization on these data, we used the personal normalized data to mine association rules based on customer preferences, and stored them in the rule base. Finally, rule information aided a preliminary recommendation; afterward, the relevance feedback mechanism improved further recommendations based on the explicit interaction from customers A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by National Science Council of R.O.C under Grant NSC99-2220-E-224-005 R EFERENCES  1  Cane Wing-Ki Leung, Stephen Chi-fai Chan, and Fu-lai Chung  A collaborative filtering framework based on fuzzy association rules and multiple-level similarity   Knowledge and Information Systems, Vol. 10, No. 3, pp 357-381, 2006 2  S.

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm.

The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
