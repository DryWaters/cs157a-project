Entity l Data Integration by Statistical Methods Hans-J Lenz Free University Berlin hjlenz@wiwiss.fu-berlin.de Abstract In most cases unique identi\336ers are required to join data from different databases If global unique keys are absent r corrupted the supplement of data extracted from different sources becomes dif\336cult The main question is Does a iven record is related to an entity which is identical to an entity corresponding to another record or not This leads to a classi\336cation problem with at least two classes identical and not identical Classifying pairs of records needs a hree-step procedure The 336rst step is to de\336ne suitable common properties attributes of data for all different sources Secondly o allow comparisons the values of the records are transformed to this common properties Finally the classi\336cation is performed on an almost 336nite subset the range of an appropriate comparison function Different classi\336cation techniques can be applied like Association Rules Classi\336cation Trees Neural networks or Record Linkage techniques The unknown parameters of the classi\336cation rules are computed by sampling and supervised learning Unbiased error rates can be estimated for instance by cross validation Special attention must be paid to control the computing complexity of the identi\336cation process The approach will be illustrated for data from two library databases and from the planned German administrative record census which will become a substitute of a regular census References  Agra w al R Imielinski T  and Sw ami A N 1993 Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases ACM SIGMOD Int Conf on Management of Data Washington DC pp 207216  Alv e y  W  and Jamerson B Eds 1997 Record Linkage T echniques 1997 Int Workshop and Exposition Fed Committee on Stat Methodology Off of Management and Budget Washington DC  Breiman L Friedman J Olshen R and Stone C 1984 Classi\336cation and regression trees Chapman and Hall 1 Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Sci entific and Statistical Database Management \(SSDBM\22203 1099-3371/03 $17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

the database and increments the counters of the candidates when an itemset became frequent so it is possible to generate new candidates based on the new frequent itemset. The candidate generation is a complex task therefore the new candidates are generated only at checkpoints. The distance of the checkpoints is an important issue in this algorithm; the optimum is reached at about 10,000 read transactions as described in [4 The Direct Hashing and PIUning algorithm \(DHP collects some information about i+ 1 itemset during the i database scan. It does not generate i+ I itemset candidates in the ith step, but it keeps an extra counter array in the memory and an possible itemset is assigned to a counter by a hash function. In this manner multiple i+ 1 itemsets have the same counter. This counter can be used during the candidate generation step. An i+ 1 itemset cannot be a candidate if its counter value is not frequent. This technique heavily reduces the number of candidates hereby it is able to speed up the itemset counting phase The FP-growth \(Frequent Pattern-growth  two-phase mining algorithm. The FP-growth algorithm fITst reads the database and counts the occurrences of the items. Regarding the I-frequent items by the second database read it builds a so-called FP-tree in the memory LI ? {I f requ e n t  i te m s e ts C2 ?

Apriori algorithm 268 After that it recursively generates conditional FP-trees and generates the frequent patterns without generating candidates. The FP-tree contains all market basket in the memory, but it can handle some itemset overlapping among the baskets, hereby it can compress the entire dataset. The main disadvantage of this algorithm is that it needs a large amount of memory. Hence it can handle limited size of datasets, but it works faster than the level wise algorithms IV. PERFORMANCE MODELLING The complexity of an algorithm is handled by setting up a computational model. The constants in the complexity formula can be calculated with regression analysis using a small number of test execution data. After this the formula can provide the execution times for a wide range of parameters A number of performance evaluation and prediction methods exist including iterative algorithms, analytical approaches of asymptotical analysis of the communication and computation complexity [7], adaptive sampling statistics techniques [8] and queuing network models [9 In case of the analytical computational model: the relation between the problem size and computational time can be determined either based on the number of operations to complete or on the memory access pattern [\\0]. The former is applied in the domain of processing-intensive problems \(heavy use of floating point arithmetic is used in case of applications that deal with lots of data, on which they usually do limited amount of simple processing steps. Frequent itemset counting is the member of the second group where the overall performance is dominated by memory access time rather than computational power 


by memory access time rather than computational power By many association rule mining algorithms an additional relevant parameter can be the I/O access time The formula given for the execution times of the frequent itemset counting in Section 5 is based on counting the average number of memory accesses in function of the statistical parameters of the processed dataset V. PERFORMANCE MODEL FOR THE APRIORI ALGORITHM Due to the extremely high memory requirements of the FP-growth based algorithms, the level-wise association rule mining algorithms were in the focus of the execution time modelling. The Apriori algorithm is basis of all the level-wise algorithms therefore its analytical perfonnance model is a very important issue Association rule mining is an NP-complete problem [5 therefore the introduced execution time approximation is valid only for a part of the parameter space. During the parameter identification it is important to choose a parameter domain that covers the commonly used datasets The main parameters of the processed dataset, which can be identified before the association rule mining, are the number of the transactions \(N transactions \(1 the dataset parameters but also on the specified minimum support threshold. The minimum support threshold \(8 used for filtering out the significant itemsets therefore the minimum support value is independent of the dataset To develop an analytical model capturing the performance of the Apriori algorithm a detailed investigation of its operation is needed. The main features of its execution time behaviour are to be detennined. The investigated parameters are independent of each other thus their effects on the response time can be observed separately The evaluation of the ApTiori algorithm took place in a PC laboratory of our department. The algorithm was implemented in C#. The simulations were executed on a computer with Pentium 4 CPU, 2.40 GHz, and 1024MB of RAM. The datasets used by the algorithm are synthetic from [2]. The naming conventions of the datasets are described in Table 1 Figure 2 illustrates the relation between the execution time and the number of transactions in the database. This relation can be well approximated by a linear function The smaller the minimum support threshold is the more itemsets fulfil the minimum support condition, and the more time is needed to discover them. The execution time dependence on the minimum support threshold is shown in Figure 3. The relationship between the two parameters is an inverse proportionality The time as a function of the average size of the transactions can be calculated considering the following facts. The distribution of the transaction lengths can be described by Gaussian distribution with T as expected value. When the 2-candidates are counted, all the two sized subset of the transactions is generated, and its occurrence is counted. This means that processing one transaction generate ti choose two subsets, which are to be counted where 1;. is the size of the given transaction. In the t, level the j-sized subsets are to be generated. The number of these subsets depends on the number of the \(jol itemsets - and through this - also on the minimum support Experimental results show that the Apriori algorithm uses more than 40% of its time to discover the two frequent itemsets The reason for that is that the number of the candidates in the second level is more orders of magnitude higher than in the further levels. It is shown in Figure 4. In this way the execution time dependence from the average size of the transactions can be modelled with a polynomial of the degree three. The constants in the polynomial can be 


degree three. The constants in the polynomial can be calculated by least squares method. The general form of the formula describing the model is shown in Equation 1 4500 4000 3500 U' 3000 2500 .. 2CJOO S 1500 lCJOO 500 o  V-V  1     lOOK 200K 300K 400K SOOK 600K 700K 800K 900K l000K number of transactions IN __ minsup?o.7% ...-min&amp;up:l Figure 2.

PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION The measurements for parameter identification were made by different dataset parameters and support thresholds. The plIliill\\eter T varied from 10 to 25 by 5, the parameter I was in the range of 2 to 8. The performance model does not contain the parameter I, because this parameter cannot be identified before the mining process Earlier experiences showed that there is a liner relationship between the response time and number of transaction hence this pllliill\\eter was fixed to 100.000. The maximal number of the hems that can occur in a transaction was 1000 The parameter of the performance model \(Equation 1 can be calculated by least square method.

MODEL V ALIDA nON After the model identification process several measurements were taken to validate the model. Table 3 contains the synthetic database parameters that were used during the model validation Figure 6 shows the measured mining time and the predicted mining time by the different datasets. It is possible to realise that the model follows well the measured execution time In some cases, especially in case of low support values the relative error of the model can be the double \(max 30 Table 3.

Therefore the introduced performance model can be used for predicting the execution time of the Apriori algorithm in the investigated dataset parameter and support value intervals VIII. CONCLUSION In this paper a basic level-wise association rule mining algorithm, the Apriori algorithm was developed and its analytical performance model was introduced. Three input parameters were taken into the consideration in this model Two parameters, namely the number of transactions and average size of transactions describes the input dataset The third parameter, the minimum support threshold is the input parameter of the mining process. The constant

The constant parameters of the model can be identified by few measurements using least square method A simple formula was given to anticipate the performance of the algorithm, described welI the behaviour of the data mining algorithm for a wide range of parameters. The main contribution of the paper was predicting the behaviour of a complex probability based data mining algorithm in a relatively simple, closed numerical form allowing a good estimation of execution times The model was validated by comparing the calculated and measured performance. Experimental results showed that the suggested model is reasonably accurate in a wide domain having an average error below 15 percent 1 2 3 4 5- 6 1 S 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 1$ 19 2\(121 22 23 204 25  16 27 2S 29 30 I .......

The reason behind this is that these algorithms are based on the Apriori algorithm thus they inherit several properties from it. Of course the identification of the constants in the formula must be repeated when moving to different algorithm in the same way as when moving to different hardware environments IX.

Unlike contemporary algorithms that either adopt a top-down or a bottom-up traversal throughout the itemset lattice to search for frequent itemsets, our algorithm employs a clever guess on the most promising itemset level cutting-level there. Then it performs a downward search, followed by an upward search to discover all other frequent itemsets. Empirical study showed that our algorithm is more than an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori variants Proceedings of the 37th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2004 0-7695-2056-1/04 $17.00 \(C 01 2 3 4 5 0.25%0.50%0.75%1.00 minsup B es t cu tt in g l ev el Figure 14.

Comparison with related work To our knowledge, [9] is the only work on combining the top-down and the bottom-up searches for association mining. But their approach and 


for association mining. But their approach and intention are quite different from ours First, rather than starting from the middle of the search space and progressively searching towards both ends, their approach proceeds from both ends of the search lattice and progressively searches towards the middle Second, their approach aims at discovering, instead of all frequent itemsets, the maximal frequent itemsets i.e., itemsets having no supersets, which work is quite simple compared to the work for discovering all frequent itemsets. Furthermore, on applying their approach to the work of frequent itemsets mining, the top-down pruning" technique on which their approach relies will become useless because the subsets of a frequent itemset found in top-down search still have to been counted to know their supports. In this way, the top-down search becomes unnecessary and their method will degenerate to the Apriori algorithm On the contrary, we believe that our method can be adapted to the problem of mining maximal frequent itemsets [1][3][9]. Indeed, we are currently working on applying our CBW to this problem and hope to have result in the near future References 1] R.C. Agarwal, C.C. Aggarwal, and V.V.V.

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
