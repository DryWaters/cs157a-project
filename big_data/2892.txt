Long-term Performance Observation of a Free Space Optics Link  M. Löschnigg*, P. Mandl*, E. Leitgeb  Institute of Broadband Communication, TU Graz, Austria markus.loeschnigg@student.tugraz.at, peter.mandl@student.tugraz.at, erich.leitgeb@tugraz.at   Abstract New bandwidth demanding services for our data networks, especially the Internet, require higher data rates This ongoing certainty will be an issue accompanying the development of future networks and a certain focus will be 
kept on this in the next couple of decades. The already available high data rates in the backbone of the Internet have to be made accessible for the end-user. Free Space Optics \(FSO\ very fast and reliable endorsement to radio links using light to transmit data. Different FSOsystems have been developed at TU Graz in the past years ranging from cheap devices, built with components available on the mass market, to expert systems using components from space technology. Besides other 
influences, weather and in particular fog has a big impact on the reliability of a FSO link. One of these systems was used in a project to collect long-term performance data over a period of almost three years. This paper shows the results in terms of availability of the optical link used in the conducted project and the influence of fog I  I NTRODUCTION  In the last three decades the use of data networks has increased enormously. In the beginning the Internet mainly provided text-oriented services like websites or 
emailing, whereas nowadays multimedia services, like Internet Protocol Television \(IPTV\ or application service providing \(ASP\as come to the fore. All these modern services offered require higher data rates for the end customers. Optical networks are networks based on optical components providing high data rates and high capacities. Fibre-to-the-home delivers these high data rates to the consumer unfortunately fibre is not comprehensively available or the cabling costs are simply too high Free Space Optics \(FSO\ a wireless technology for 
the last mile access capable to overcome the lack of fibre cables. FSO systems can be operated in a point-to-point mode to interconnect two locations or in a point-tomultipoint mode. In the past years different types of FSO systems have been developed at TU Graz. To undermine the high availability of FSO links, very short term observations have been conducted. Availability in general defines the proportion of time a system is in full operational condition. It is usually expressed in percentage. In terms of FSO systems the availability gives the percentage of time a link is available for 
communication. The results of these observations have revealed that atmospheric disturbances, especially fog have an impact on the reliability of a FSO link Therefore a project was initiated in April 2006 to collect long-term data. In the municipality of Dobl, close to Graz, Austria, a deactivated antenna mast of a broadcast station is used by public institutions to collect weather data and is therefore equipped with a broadband Internet connection. Dobl was interested to interlink its elementary school close to the antenna mast with the broadcast station to provide an Internet connection for the students [2 T h e 
air-distance between the school building and the broadcast station is approximately 300 meters. Considering all these circumstances the location is ideal for measurements   Figure 1.Visualization of the project area with the FSO link  II  FSO  S YSTEMS   P ROJECT  A free space optics system \(FSO\ a very flexible broadband access solution providing high data rates without long cabling to access backbone networks. In 
comparison to other wireless access technologies \(e.g point-to-point radio systems\ a FSO system has outstanding advantages like higher bandwidth, better ability to concentrate beams, simpler assembling and disassembling, better beam bundling, no license fees for the usage of radio channels, better security against wiretapping. Disadvantages are atmospheric influences like rain, snow, fog and direct sun beams. Today FSO 


point-to-point links are used for the quick setup of low range inner city links, broadband links between motorways, rail tracks or rivers, for the wiretap-proof connection between company buildings and corresponding institutions and to connect mobile sanitary and other equipment of executive authorities, the fire brigade, and armed forces to a backbone network during crisis operations. For these reasons FSO is the optimal technology to operate within the numerated and many more cases A FSO system which offers a bidirectional point-topoint function consists of two separated optical sending and receiving units \(OSE\with integrated receiving and transmitting devices. The receiving part is realised with PIN diodes whereas the transmitting one is made up with LED or laser diodes The FSO devices used in the present \(Fig. 2\ject where built with components available on the mass market. The possible functional range of these devices is declared for a distance ranging from 30 m to 600 m with clear sky conditions. The recommended distance of operation is defined for an air-line of slightly less than 300 m    Figure 2. FSO system developed by TU Graz and used in the project mounted onto the antenna mast with a detailed front-view of the system in the right hand corner  The optical transmitter consists of eight high power LEDs operating at 850nm with a total transmission power of 28mW and a beam divergence of 42mrad \(2.5°\. This complies with Laser Class 1M \(IEC 60 825-1: 2001\The optical receiver is equipped with a Si-PIN diode with a sensitivity of 45µW/m 2 and an additional optical band pass filter. The data and management interfaces are realised with a fibre connection, the data transfer rate is given by 10Mbit/s with a protocol transparent Ethernet interface  To adjust the system, both OSE units are equipped with LED indicators and an analogue measurement instrument to display the received power One OSE device was mounted onto the antenna mast Fig. 2\he corresponding device onto a stable massive suspension arrangement outside a window of the school building. A clear line of sight is of course necessary and available between the locations \(Fig. 3\. Data collecting started in April 2006 and ended at the end of November 2008. All necessary power supplies were redundantly available not to lose data because of lack of power   Figure 3. Line of sight from the school building to the antenna mast III  A TMOSPHERIC I NFLUENCES  Short term observations of other installations have shown that atmospheric influences affect the reliability of a FSO link on Earth. Different influences, like rainfall snow, direct sunlight or fog cause diverse disturbances to the connection. FSO links used in space for inter-satellite communications are not confronted with this kind of atmospheric influences and are therefore not hindered by weather. Our atmosphere is divided into different layers with different characteristics. The Troposphere is the layer we live in and is also the layer where the entire weather pattern is happening. It is known from other investigations that dense fog can have the major impact on the reliability of a FSO link Everything falling down from the sky in terms of weather is referred to as atmospheric fallout. The continuous movement of water below, above and on the surface of the Earth is called hydrologic cycle. During this movement water changes from one aggregate state to another, always repeating the movement T h ere are  different processes during this movement, one of them is condensation. Condensation is responsible for producing clouds and fog through transformation of water vapour to liquid water droplets in the air. Fog is distinguished from clouds through the contact with the ground. Basically, fog is a cloud bank contacting the ground and causing the visibility to drop to a value less than 1000 m. Fog itself is again subdivided into many types, depending on how the cooling that caused the condensation occurred    Figure 4. Fog covering the valley, seen from a mountain at 2000 m 


For the formation of fog it is fundamental for the water to condense upon something. This could be dust, aerosols or anything else like pollutants. So environmental pollution can have an effect on the forming of fog which indirectly affects the availability of an optical link It is also very important to understand that there is a difference between maritime and continental fog  the average dense fog in the project area the attenuation can be defined with up to 100 db/km. The state of fog is very stable for a long time, like an hour, not causing fast changes in the attenuation. Figure 5 shows typical results found in earlier investigations for the area of Graz  Figure 5. Specific attenuation for 850 & 950 nm at Graz   Dense maritime fog on the contrary is different and can be defined with up to 400 db/km. Fast changes are very common because of the sea-side winds moving the air-masses quickly \(Fig. 6\e results in figure 6 were collected in La Turbie, near Nice \(France\ng with the data show in figu   T h ere is als o a s i g n i f i cant  difference in the particle size. Particles of continental fog usually have a diameter of 4 µm whereas particles of maritime fog have an average size of 20 µm ll i n all  the assumption can be made that the availability of a FSO link will mainly depend on the geographic location Different locations on Earth will bear different availability data for FSO links  Figure 6. Specific attenuation for 550 nm and 850 & 950 nm near Nice   IV  M EASUREMENT   D ATA C OLLECTION  Data about the availability of the link was gathered through permanently sending small Internet Protocol packets from one end and requiring the receiving side to reply to the sent packet. The measurements were conducted under real life conditions. The whole network of the school with about twenty personal computers was connected to the Internet using the broadband connection in the broadcast station accessed through the FSO link The broadband connection is limited to 4 Mbit/s, so even under full load the optical crosslink still provides sufficient resources to handle the measurement packets At both locations dedicated servers for collecting data were installed and used to initiate traffic over the optical wireless connection every 10 ms. The results of the measurements were stored into a remotely accessible database. Additionally every full hour a regular file download via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol \(http\was initiated over the FSO link to protocol the data rate. The size of the transferred file was exactly 200 megabytes. A high layer protocol was chosen to fulfil the requirements of a real life test As stated before visibility drops enormously when fog comes into play. The project area is very close to an airport and so Austro Control, the official agency overseeing the Austrian Airspace, is also collecting visibility data for the area around the antenna mast. As fog is very stable in that area visibility is only measured once an hour, giving twenty four values a day.  Having two different sources of data made it necessary to correlate this information V  R ESULTS AND I NTERPRETATION  The already available statistic data from Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics in Austria concerning the project area shows that there are approximately 140 days of fog every year, usually in the period between October and March. So we expect mainly failures in the optical wireless connection during the winter months. The availability for the present link is shown for every single year in the following diagram based on the raw data. The raw data reflects the correlated values from the sources without considering known breakdowns of the system     Figure 7. Availability of the FSO link from 4/2006 to 11/2008 per year 


In the year 2006 the overall availability based on the raw data is 94.79%, which is still a high value but low compared to the other two years. During December 2006 there was a scheduled renovation work going on for seven days demanding to shutdown the optical link Excluding the collected values during the intended shutdown gives the real availability \(Fig. 8    Figure 8. Availability of the FSO link from 4/2006 to 11/2008 per year with corrected data of intended shutdowns  The availability of the link calculated with the corrected values increases to 97.35% which is very close to the values of the years 2007 and 2008. This allows the conclusion that the yearly cyclic weather pattern over the observation period behaved stable. Averaging the data of the almost three years gives the total availability of the FSO link for the present project \(Fig. 9    Figure 9. Average yearly FSO link availability based on the corrected data from 4/2006 until 11/2008  The average availability of 97.80% is a very good result for an optical wireless communication path. In comparison to a wired connection with availability of around or even more than 99.99% the investigated value seems to be low. Assuming a non leap year with 365 days gives a break-down time of the FSO link for slightly greater than 8 days \(8.03 d\ FSO links deliver a very high performance in terms of speed but the case study shows a downtime of eight days. So further projects should be conducted to couple FSO links with other wireless links to enhance the overall availability However, the question arises, taking all available data into account, if the assumption is correct and the FSO link mainly fails in the winter months from October to March due to the worse weather conditions compared to the summer months. Again, it has to be stated that this is only true for the project area. In the area of Graz, Austria dense fog mainly appears in the colder months due to low temperature. Fog is usually produced when the difference between temperature and dew point is less than 2.5 degrees Celsius    Figure 10. Average FSO link availability  a comparison of winter and summer months from 4/2006 until 11/2008  Figure 10 clearly shows the correctness of the assumption made prior. During the summer months the availability is exceptionally high whereas in the winter months the percentage of 95.61% reduces the overall performance to 97.80%. As we know that fog in the project area mainly occurs in the winter time we need to find a relation between the breakdown of the link and the decrease of the visibility caused by atmospheric influences. Only the winter months are of interest because no breakdowns occurred during the summer months. Due to the fact that the huge amount of data points cannot all be show in one diagram, a representative day was chosen    Figure 11. Availability of the FSO link and corresponding visibility on the 26 th of December 2006  Figure 11 shows the availability in an hourly resolution in blue colour and its ordinate is on the left hand side whereas the visibility has its ordinate on the right hand side and is shown in red colour. Values of the visibility higher than 350 m have been scaled to 350 m to fit into the diagram nicely. The documented maximum value of the visibility on the 26 th of December is 20 km. Any visibility value greater than 350 m has no importance for 


this setup. Analyzing all the available data reveals that the availability of the FSO link and the corresponding visibility relate to each other in a simple way. For the used FSO systems in the present project a threshold can be set. As soon as the visibility drops to a value less than 200 m the optical link is heavily disturbed by atmospheric influences and the crosslink dies. The components used to build the devices were chosen to overcome distances of up to 600 m with perfectly clear sky conditions and of about 300 m with light atmospheric disturbances However, dense fog definitely is a massive atmospheric influence and has therefore an impact on the availability of this very FSO link In contrary to radio communication in Free Space Optics the data rate does not drop to a smaller value under atmospheric influence. The optical link is either operational with the high data rate promised or completely lacks service. This is a great difference to other wireless technologies like Wireless Local Area Network \(WLAN\r satellite communication. The reason for this can be found in the way of communication. The pin photo diode at the receivi ng end tries to detect the incoming data from the sending site. Either the detection is successful, meaning sufficient information made its way into the receiving end with the full available data rate or the detection fails causing the communication to break down completely. The observations made during this project also undermine the very binary operation mode of FSO links. If a significant amount of photons can be detected by the photo diode then the full data rate is available. On the contrary if the threshold of detection is undercut no communication whatsoever is possible Deep analysis of the daily data and confirms this performance Furthermore not only the availability of the link is very high, also the devices themselves obviously provide great service over a long period of time. The initial installation of the FSO link including mounting the devices alignment of the systems and testing the connection, took one and an half hours. Since then no maintenance work had to be accomplished VI  C ONCLUSION  Free Space Optics is an excellent wireless communication technology, especially as last mile access and nomadic use technology [9 T h e in s t allat i on proces s  is very easy and quick, the high data rates available are definitive a great advantage. This field study has shown that a standalone FSO link can provide a very reliable connection with a total availability of 97.80% over thirty two months. In any case FSO systems should not be seen in competition with WLAN or other radio technologies it should rather be seen as a widening to the wireless world Future work should concentrate on increasing the availability and reliability of FSO links Current researches at TU Graz deal with a topic called switch-over. Links based on microwaves and FSO connections are differently influenced by atmospheric incidents. Microwave links are mainly disturbed by rain whereas FSO connections principally interfere with dense fog. The switch-over technology tries to combine both existing technologies to increase the overall reliability [4  of a link. Basically a FSO link is used for communication to provide a high data rate. However, parallel to the FSO connection a microwave link is installed to function as a backup channel. Whenever the atmospheric disturbances are too heavy for the optical link to work, a switch-over to the fallback microwave link is issued. As soon as the optical link comes available again the communication channel switches back to the more powerful FSO link in terms of data rates. The combined system is often called hybrid system d a real  f a s t s w i t cho v e r is  v ita l f o r it to work Another idea to increase the availability could be a change in the setup of the receiver side. In a very new approach someone could try to use greater areas like house walls as a receiver. The walls need to be coated with a special material collecting the information Finally, the collected data by the successfully conducted project has undermined the importance of fog for the FSO technology once more. The long-term observation of this link has shown that the availability of the optical connection in the summer months is better than in the winter months in the latitudes of Austria A CKNOWLEDGMENT  Regarding the excellent outcome of results the research group for Optical Communications \(OptiKom\TU Graz thanks all their cooperation partners for their support mainly the national cooperation partner Telekom Austria AG, the government of Styria, ML11  EDVDienstleistungen GmbH and the international cooperation partners within COST 270, SatNEx and COST 291 R EFERENCES  1 L e itg e b E., Br e g e n z e r J., F a sse r P G e bhar t M  Free Space Optics Extension to Fiber-Networks for the Last Mile Proceedings and Presentation at IEEE / LEOS 2002 Annual Meeting, 10 th 14 th  of November 2002, Glasgow, Scotland  2  L e i t g e b E  S h e i kh Muham m ad S Ch lesti l Ch G e bha r t M  Birnbacher U Reliability of FSO Links in Next Generation Optical Networks Proceedings and Invited Presentation at the IEEEconference ICTON 2005, 3 rd 7 th of Juliy2005, Barcelona  3 L e itg e b E G e bhar t  M B i r n ba che r U S c hr o tte r P   Me r d o n ig  A  Truppe A Hybrid wireless networks for civil-militarycooperation \(CIMIC\ and disaster management Proceedings and Presentation at SPIE's European Symposium on Optics and Photonics for Defence and Security, Vol. 5614, pp. 139-150, 25 th  28 th October 2004, London  4 L e itg e b E., G e bhar t  M  Bir n b a c h e r U K o gle r W S c hr o t te r P    High availability of hybrid wireless networks Proceedings and Presentation at SPIE's International Symposium Photonics Europe Vol. 5465, pp. 238-249, 26 th 30 th April 2004, Straßburg  5 L e itg e b E., G e bhar t  M  Bir n b a c h e r U  Optical Networks, Last Mile Access and Applications Book-Chapter of Free-Space Laser Communications: Principles and Advances, \(accepted 2004 published 2008\, Springer Verlag, ISBN: 978-0-387-28652-5  6 L e itg e b E., G e bhar t  M F a sse r P   Br e g e n z e r J., T a n c z o s J., I m pact of atmospheric effects in Free Space Optics transmission systems Proceedings and Presentation at SPIE Photonics West, LASE 2003, 25 th 31 st of January 2003, San Jose, CA, USA

6 CONCLUSION Neptec has developed a vision system for autonomous onorbit rendezvous and docking that does not require the use of cooperative markers on the target spacecraft The system uses an active TriDAR 3D sensor and efficient model based tracking algorithms to provide 6 degree of freedom 6DOF relative pose information in real-time The system takes full advantage of the large amount of geometric information contained in 3D data sets By following the More Information Less Data MILD paradigm where the sensor only acquires the data necessary to obtain the pose of the target real-time performance can be achieve with flight hardware Following the same smart scanning strategy Neptec has developed a novel technique for localizing a known object on-orbit The new technique called Polygonal Aspect Hashing does not require an initial guess of the relative pose and therefore can be used to initialize tracking or recover if tracking is lost Furthermore it only requires a very sparse non organized 3D point cloud thus keeping the data acquisition and pre-processing overhead to a minimum The technique follows logic similar to the process of adding a piece in a jigsaw puzzle First the set of possible positions and orientations of the scan with respect to the model is reduced to the set of poses that have sufficient overlap Once the set of poses is reduced to the most likely candidates a surface fit check is performed to determine the best matching pose The surface fit check measures the amount of overlap between an input scan and the surface of a reference 3D model of the object to find The algorithm developed was tested with both simulated and TriDAR data Results showed excellent performance and demonstrated that the algorithm works well even with very sparse input data sets as well as in the presence of sensor noise and distortions Processing time results obtained showed that real-time performance can be achieved with this technique As would be expected it was shown that the robustness can be increased by testing more polygons at the expense of processing time Another alternative would be to run the algorithm with one polygon over several sequential scans This technique would be well suited for operations where there is relative motion between the sensor and target like in a tumbling satellite scenario or if the processing power is limited In the future Neptec plans to test more objects with representative geometry and materials to further characterize the algorithm performance The effect of object symmetries will also be investigated It was observed that most failures tend to occur where the object is most symmetric Code optimization will also be performed to further improve performance 1 MacLean S Pinkney L Machine Vision in Space Can Aeronaut Space J 39\(2 63-77 1993 2 Howard Richard T Bryan Thomas C DART AVGS flight results Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp.65550L 2007 3 Ruel S English C Anctil M Church P 43DLASSO Real-time pose estimation from 3D data for autonomous satellite servicing Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 4 Ruel S English C Anctil M Daly J Smith C Zhu S Real-time 3D vision solution for on-orbit autonomous rendezvous and docking Proc SPIE Vol 6220 pp.622009 2006 5 Andrew Johnson and Martial Hebert Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3-D scenes IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 21\(5 449 May 1999 6 H Wolfson I Rigoutsos Geometric Hashing An Overview IEEE Computational Science  Engineering 4\(4 October 1997 7 English C Zhu X Smith C Ruel S Christie I TriDAR A hybrid sensor for exploiting the complimentary nature of triangulation and LIDAR technologies Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 8 J Obermark G Creamer B Kelm W Wagner C Henshaw SUMO/FREND vision system for autonomous satellite grapple Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp 65550Y 2007 9 Deslauriers A Showalter I Montpool A Taylor R Christie I Shuttle TPS inspection using triangulation scanning technology SPIE 2005 Orlando Florida April 2005 10 Ruel S English C Melo L Berube A Aikman D Deslauriers A Church P and Maheux J Field testing of a 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Orlando Florida April 12-16 2004 11 English C Ruel S Melo L Church P and Maheux J Development of a Practical 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Proceedings on Automatic Target Recognition XIV Orlando Florida April 2004 10 REFERENCES

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
