threshold changes Keywords Incremental Mining Data Mining Frequent Itemsets Association Rules 1 Introduction In recent years data mining has attracted much attention in database research This is due to its wide applicability in many areas including the retail industry and the finance sector The availability of automated tools has enabled the collection of large amount of data These large databases contain information that is potentially useful for making market strategies and financial forecasts Data mining is the task to find out such useful information from large databases 
The information includes association rules characteristic rules classification rules generalized relations, discrimination rules, etc Of the various data mining problems mining of association rules is an important one Various algorithms have been proposed  1,2,4,7 to discover frequent itemsets An influential association rule mining algorithm has been developed for rule mining in large transaction database DHP[3 algorithm is an extension of Apriori using a hashing technique These algorithms adopted the generation-and -test approach. They iteratively generate the set of frequent itemset of length k+l 
from the set of frequent itemset of length k and then check their support counts in the database Maintenance of discovered association rules by incremental updating has been studied in 5 The problem of updating the association rules can be reduced to finding the new set of large itemsets. After that the new association rules can be computed using the new large itemsets A simple solution to the update problem is to re-compute the large itemsets 
under various thresholds This is clearly inefficient because all the computations done initially for finding the old large itemsets are wasted and all frequent itmesets have to be re-computed again from scratch Therefore the primary aim of incremental mining is to avoid or minimize fining the old large itemsets by using the intermediate data constructed during the earlier mining Jiming Liu and Jian Yin presented an efficient algorithm called Posteriori  for computing the frequent 
itemsets under the varied thresholds However this algorithm generates a huge number of useless candidate itemsets and will be a time-consuming process in the prune step In this paper we propose an adaptive algorithm for the maintenance of association rules in light of threshold changes. The general idea is organized as follow 1 Make use of large and candidate itemsets and their counts in the database under old threshold and finds which rules continue to prevail and which rules fail with new 
threshold 2 Apply Apriorixen function to generate candidate itemsets thereby reduce some candidate itemsetrs and consume less time in the prune step The remaining of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 describes algorithm Posteriori Section 3 details algorithm IMAM for incremental mining of association rules Section 5 discusses our algorithm with Posteriori Section 5 gives the conclusion 0-7803-7865-2/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE 67 


Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Xi'an 2-5 November 2003 2 Algorithm Posteriori 2.1 Problem Description Let I i    i  be a set of items. Let TDB be a set of transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that Tc I Associated with each transaction is a unique identifier called its TID We say that a transaction T contains X a set of some items in I if X E T An association rule is an implication of the form X  Y where X cI Y cI and X n Y 0 The rule X3 Y holds in the transaction set TDB with confidence c if c of transactions in TDB that contain X also contains Y The rule X 3 Y has support s in the transaction set TDB ifs of transactions in TDB contains X U Y The problem of frequent mining is to find the complete set of frequent pattems in a given transaction database with respect to a given support threshold min-sup 2.2 Algorithm Posteriori The following notations are used in the rest of the paper L is the set of all k-frequent itemsets in TDB under the support of s and L  is the set of all k-frequent itemsets in TDB under the support of s  C  is the set of k-candidate itemsets in the k-th iteration of Posteriori Moreover X.support represents the support counts of an itemset X in TDB When min-sup is changed two cases may happen 1 s   s a frequent itemset in L may not be a frequent 2 s   s an itemset X not in L may become a frequent itemset in L  In the first case Posteriori-A can generate the complete frequent itemsets Now let us concentrate on the second case mentioned above At the first iteration we scan C  L  by checking the condition X.support  s  X ITDBI As all new frequent itemsets are found we call them 1 1 thus L L U 1  All the frequent itemsets are divided into two non-intersecting sets L and 1  All the subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent so any frequent 1-itemset corresponds to a single item of k-itemsets must be an element of L Accordmg to this we can obtain three mutually intersecting subsets and we call them L 1 itemset inL  or 1 L a and L  respectively Moreover we can filter orignal L  from L  l and call remaining itemset 1   then we have L  l]=L  U 1   and also we have L  L k I U L k f21 k 3i k k 21  0 L  2 n L  3 0 and L  l n L  3 0  Therefore we can decompose the generation of candidate sets into three parts L k  13 L k 2 and L k 3 respectively For C   13 and C  2 this is simple we also apply C   l]=Apriori_gen\(L C  2]=Apriori_gen\(L k-l 2 The key problem is how to generate C   Algorithm Posteriori-B modified Apriorisen function into Posteriorisen function The function works as follow First in the join step we join Li  11 and L k-i 2 insert into C  3 select p.item p.item    p.item  q.item  the Apriorisen function in algorithm Apriori   11  L  q.item   q.item from Lj l p Lk-i 121 q Next in the prune step we delete all itemsets CE C 3 such that some k-1 of c is not in L  for all itemsets c E C  3 do for all k- 1 s of c do if s P L  then delete c from C  3 However we find the Posteriorijen function will generate a huge number of useless candidate itemsets and will be a time-consuming in the prune step 3 Algorithm IMARA This paper mainly concentrates on generating C  3 The general idea is that we also apply Apriorisen function to generate C   Therefore we can reduce the some of candidate itemsets and consume less time in the prune step For k=2 we know all the subsets of a candidate itemsets in C or 1 Therefore we need not prune these subsets because they are frequent We adopt NIUAsen2 function to generate 3 must be an element of L 68

Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 4 Discussions Comparing with Posteriori the efficiency of IMARA comes from the following aspects 1 We need not prune these subsets from 2 candidate itemsets, because we all know all the subsets of a candidate itemsets in C 3 must be an element of L Therefore, they are frequent However Posteriori consume a lot of time in the prune step 2 While generating 3-candidate itemsets we only check whether the combinations of different elements are frequent, thereby saving the effort of unnecessarily pruning In contrast Posteriori need prune all the subsets from 3-candidate itemsets 3 We apply Apriori-gen function to generate C k 3 not modify the Aprioriden function into PosterioriJen function Therefore we avoid generating the candidate itemsets from L 3 and L 3 L l and L f 3 and so on, thereby saving the effort of unnecessarily pruning or 1 5 Conclusions In this paper we propose an adaptive algorithm IMARA for incremental mining of association rules in light of threshold changes Since algorithm IMARA represents a new highly efficient incremental mining method it can be applied to other applications like the mining of Web Text and so on References R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of data Washington R Agrawal and R Srikant.

sampling interval the true observation which is close to the predicted value of the measurement has fewer 223com petitors\222\222 false alarms in its likelihood function evalua tion This can explaii in part why nonuniform sampling is a good idea with assignment 5 Numerica I Resu Its In the simulations of both the PDAF and the N-D assign ment algorithm we use the one dimensional target model described in Section 2 5.1 The PDAF Uniform Sampling Is Better Nonuniform sampling is compared to uniform sampling in Figure 8 a representative result for the PDAF in which for the nonuniform case we have TI  0.1 and T2  1.9 seconds as compared to the uniform-sampling case\222s T  1 second The plot shows average track life in seconds Apparently the difference between nonuniform and uni form dwindles as the number of false alarms increases we shall soon see that this is also the case for a multi frame tracker But the clearest conclusion is that for the PDAF and presumably for any frame-by-frame tracker a uniform sampling rate is better Figure 8 depicts only one set of parameters but we have been unable to fu?d a case in which its conclusion is contradicted 5.2 Assignment Weird Sampling Can Be Preferable Figure 9 shows the behavior of a threescan assignment algorithm the percentage of tracks lost in 200 seconds is plotted and as in Figure 8 we have T1  0.1 and T2  1.9 seconds as compared to the uniform-sampling case\222s T  1 second As with the PDAF the nonuniform sampling performance improves relatively speaking as the clutter density increases However and unlike Figure 8 nonuniform sampling is actually preferable to uniform provided there are enough false alarms This is ampued in Figure 10 which shows the percent age of lost tracks as a function of the ratio Tl/T2 with of course the stipulation T1  T2  2 seconds in all cases It is clear from this that when pairs of samples are close i.e a small ratio there can be a si@cant improvement from a nonuniform approach The difference can be substantial a factor of two when the ratio approaches zero inter estingly this is the 223data fusion\224 case discussed earlier Figure 10 is particularly kid to nonuniformity because it depicts the case of perfect detection there are false alarms but no measurements are missed Figure 11 ex plores this further Apparently the improvement for the nonuniform sampling case is greatest when the tar get is faithfully present in the data we shall discuss this in the next section Generally though we have found that nonuniform sampling is preferable only when PD  80  90 For the discretized continuous-time white noise accelera tion model of Section 2 the maneuvering index dehed T3 A 0 in which T refers to the uniform inter-sampling time provides a convenient scalar measure of a target\221s elusive ness Figure 12 plots the percentage of lost tracks against A and reveals that any benefits of nonuniform sampling are magnified by a more-maneuvering target in l as 2 6 Discussion It has been asserted that uniform sampling is always preferable to nonuniform when the tracking algorithm as sociates measurements to targets on a scan-by-scan basis as with a PDAF However and on the contrary if asso ciation is based on several scans\222 worth of measurements then nonuniform sampling actually has something to offer This is especially true when the probabfity of detection is high when the clutter is high and when the target\221s maneuvering indm is high Now this study of nonuniform sampling was motivated by the idea that data association might be helped by a cross-chd between returns from two contiguous scans of observations Presumably this is indeed a beneficial ef fect However association is hampered by false-alarms and the number of these can be thought of as propor tional to the size of the association 224gate\223 surrounding each measurement\221s predicted location and inside which candidate associations are sought This gate has volume itself proportional to the innovations\222 covariance S actu ally the square root of its determinant and is hence a quadratic polpomial of the time between scans Presum ably then this favors a uniform sampling The point is that these two effects are in anflict and it is difFicult to tell at the outset which wiU dominate In fact we cannot even envision proofs of the earlier observations given the complexity of the tracking task However the tendencies observed e.g high PD is best for nonuniform are reasonable and in the following sections we shall try to explain why We shall begin with a study of the Kalman flter and in particular its average gate size 6.1 The Kalman Filter Case Underlying most trackiig systems is the Kalman flter the tracker that would be optimal were there no measurement origin uncertain Above it is argued that the perfor mance of a tracki system is degraded by a larger gate size since the greater the gate the more false alarms can enter Prediction of the gate size is difficult but in the simplistic Kalman flter situation it can be done For the usual Kalman flter the steady-state gate size is straightforward to estimate from the discrete time Ric 4-1601 


cati equation l Here however the gate size varies due to the irregular sampling times During the longer inter-sampling interval the gate will increase more than it would have increased during a uniform sampling time but of course it begins from a smaller uncertainty due to the prior short sampling interval The question is which effect wins Let us consider the model of Section 2 but to incorporate uneven sampling we shall stack the state for consecutive pairs of scans Specifically let us write with reference to S and its sequel r\(\(k  1 Tl  T2  T2 I 23 in which z is a stacked vector of position and velocity where Q1 and Q2 are from 12 Solution of the dis crete algebraic Riocati equation with the above parame ters yields prediction uncertainties when estimation is in steady state the 1,l element is required for the gate volume for the T1 interval and the same procedure with TI and T2 interchanged goes toward the T\222-interval\222s gate volume In Figure 13 the average gate volume averaged over long and short intervals is plotted as a function of the ra tio Tl/\(T1  T2 We see that this average is actually greatest for the uniform sampling case and least for the 222data fusion\224 scenario We also observe that the benefit from nonuniform sampling increases as the target exhibits greater manmverabfity a corroboration of the observa tions in Figure 11 6.2 The Case With Data Association As discussed earlier analytic results with data associa tion are sparse However there is a recent development of some interest a Cramer-Rao lower bound \(CRLB has been developed for single-target tracking As given in lo this CRLB has elements of the Riccati equation although the parameters are modified somewhat by an 223informa tion reduction factor\224 that reduces measurement fidelity as a function of the uncertainty in provenance Now the CRLB shows the accuracy of an optimal MAP estimator The truly MAP estimator never loses track regardless of the harshness of the tracking scenario as such we cannot expect any corroboration of the 223track-length\224 behavior of a practical tracker such as the PDAF or hard-assignment However the CRLB does provide a measure of the curva ture of the log-likelihood function near the true data and is in that regard a rekement of the Kalman filter results in that data axiociation is accounted for Example results are shown in Figure 14 which plots the CRLB after both long and short-interval predictions as a function of clutter density Perhaps of greatest interest here is that the short-interval uncertainty is sign%cantly less than that when uniform sampling is used and that even for the longer interval the inflation in this quantity is not huge That is the less-comprehensive but more exact analysis for the Kalman filter does seem to apply We also show in Figure 15 the corresponding results obtained from simulation and assignment trackers  qualitatively Figures 14 and 15 are very similar 6.3 Multi-Scan Tracker Results Our contention at the outset was that if one was pre sented with two measurements relatively close in time, one could crosschock detections in one with those in the other and thereby eliminate from serious consideration many false alarms The disadvantage from doing this however is the lengthened time between such pairs of samples when one assumes a constant average sensor resource budget the uncertainty gate grows and more false alarms enter the picture However it appears that a multi-scan tracker can see some benefits from nonuniform sampling in the situations listed below High Maneuvering Index This is not immediately apparent However the Kalman filter analysis does indicate that it will be so A more-maneuvering tar get engenders a more quickly increasing gate which magnifies effects High False Alarm Density Similar to target maneu ver a greater clutter density magnifies any effects from a small or a large gate High Probability of Detection Any possible benefit from the proposed 223cross-che&\224 is lost if the true observation is not detected frequently or is not ex pected to do so The ikst two cmnsiderations are tantamount to the target being difficult to track whereas the last a high Po indi cates an easier tracking task  usually heavy clutter and high maneuvering index go with low Po although both clutter and PI can be adjusted together by the detection threshold The reason that a high probability of detec tion is necess,ary to observe the benefits of nonuniform sampling is that if a measurement is not repeated in suc ceding scans at a lower Po then it may be either a miss or clutter but if Po is suf3iciently high the overwhelming likelihood is for the latter 6.4 Single-Scan Tracker Results The PDAF and presumably other scan-by-scan data association algorithms such as JPDAF or 2-D assign 4-1602 


ment cannot by dehition realize any benefit from non uniform sampling's cross-validation between scan pairs As to whether the they are hindered by an increase in average gate size the Kalman filter and CRLB analysis suggest that this ought not be so However both these analyses are quite idealized in the former there is no data association the PDAF must associate false alarms and missed detections and in the latter estimation is op timal based on all received data the PDAF is certainly not that It turns out that the PDAF's imperfections dominate 7 Conc I usion In this paper nonuniform sampling and uniform sampling schemes are compared in different trackers PDAF and N-D assignment In some situations such as when data comes from a rotating radar it is moot to discuss the benefits from or drawbadis to a nonuniform data-taking structure But in some situations a non-uniform struc ture is imposed an example of this is data fusion in which measurements arrive from asynchronous sensors One tends to treat this as an unavoidable evil but is it really that bad In fact it can be beneficial This indicates perhaps that intelligent sensor-resource man agement systems ought to consider deliberate staggering sampling times We have explored only the simplest case of non uniformity that in which measurements arrive in pairs separated by a short interval we take this as a proxy for more complicated situations It has been shown that for the PDAF uniform sampling is always best However when the tracker utilizes more than one scan of data from the past  as with multipleframe assignment or presum ably the multi-hypothesis tracker MHT  nonuniform can outperform uniform sampling This is particularly so when 0 the target is highly maneuverable and/or 0 the false alarm density is hi and/or 0 the probability of detection is high In the above, we speak in terms of percentage of lost tracks and of average track lifetime and in all cases the aggregate sensor resource is kept constant meaning for example that one non-uniform scheme with short interval 0.1 sec ond and long interval 1.9 seconds can be fairly compared to a uniform scheme in which the constant inter-sample interval is 1 second Further and in all situations, nonuniform sampling yields a significant reduction in MSE in the short sampling inter val than does uniform sampling at the expense of course of a larger 1LISE after the long interval This is not sur prising but it does indicate that if a tracking estimate is to be used for targeting it is a good idea to begin to use staggered samples and to launch after a short-interval sample Acknow I edgment This research has been supported by AFOSR under con tract nunher F49620-97-1-0198 and by ONR under con tract nunher N00014-97-1-0502 References l Y Bar-Shalom X Li and T Kirubarajan Estima tion with Application to Tracking and Navigation Wiley 2001 2 Y Bar-Shalom and X Li Multitarget-Multisensor Tracking Principles and Techniques YBS Publishing 1995 3 Y Bar-Shalom and X Li Stability evaluation and track life of the PDAF for trackii in clutter I E E E Transactions on Automatic Control Vol 36 pp 588-602 May 1991 4 F Daum A System Approach to Multiple Target Trackiig In Multitarget-Multisensor Tracking Appli cations and Advances Volume I I Y Bar-Shalom editor Art House 1996 5 C L Morefield Application of 0-1 Integer Pro gramming to Multi-target Tracking Problems IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control Vol 22 pp 302-312 June 1977 6 K R Pattipati S Deb Y Bar-Shalom and R.B Washburn Passive Multisensor Data Association Using a New Relaxation Algorithm In Multitarget-Multisensor Tracking Advanced Applications Y Bar-Shalom editor Art House 1990 7 K R Pattipati S Deb Y Bar-Shalom and R.B Was&urn A New Relaxation Algorithm and Passive Sensor Data Association IEEE Transactions on Auto matic Control Vol 37\(2 Feb 1992 SI P Smith and G Buechler A Branching Algorithm for Discriminating and Tracking Multiple Objects I E E E Transactions on Automatic Control Vol 20 pp 101-104 Feb 1975 9 P Willett M Alford and V Vannicola The Case for Likesensor PreDetection Fusion I E E E Transac tions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems pp 986-1000 October 1994 lo X Zhang and P Willett Cram&-Rao Bounds for Discrete-Time Linear Filtering with Measurement Origin Uncertainties Proceedings of the Workshop on Estima tion Tracking and Fusion A Tribute to Yaakov Bar Shalom Monterey, CA May 2001 4-1603
