Figure 18  Main frequencies appearing on a Bode diagram eration The variation of acceleration is at a given time 016~a  1  2 m  032SV 2 001  C where 001  C is the variation of the aerodynamics coef\002cients due to the variation of the angle of attack If the multi-dimensional factor is a white noise vector its power spectral density is constant and equal to S xx  2 031  on  000 2 031f N  2 031f N  where f N is the Nyquist frequency and S xx  033 2  2 f N  with 033 the standard deviation of the white noise f N is half of the sampling frequency Thus the expected instantaneous power for the frequencies below f lim is P lim  1 2 031 Z 2 031f lim 000 2 031f lim S xx  j  d  033 2 f lim f N 23 P lim is calculated with an expected value of the power but the integration limits the difference with a real power The variation due to these frequencies lower than f lim cannot be higher than the variation of a sinus at the frequency f lim concentrating all their power x lim  t   033 s 2 f lim f N cos\(2 031f lim t  036  24 Because f lim is low the effect of the 002lter H w is a simple gain and the corresponding wind is w lim  t   033 w q L w 031V x lim  t   The effect of the lower frequencies is also maximized by considering that 017 The variation of w lim  t  between t  0 and t  T simu where T simu is the simulation time is maximum for a phase 036 equal to 000 031 2 000 031f lim T simu  Indeed in this case the function crosses zero at t  T simu  2  This maximum variation of w lim  t  between t  0 and t  T simu is called 001 w  017 The sine normally varies progressively and the controller continuously limits the effect of the wind Thus the variation of the angle of attack should be smaller than 001 013  Figure 19  Lower frequencies with limited in\003uence arctan\(\001 w=V   but this value is used as a constant from the beginning to the end of the simulation 017 The relation between 001 013 on 001 C z depends on the value of C z  The largest 001 C z obtainable with 001 013 is used 017 The variation of the amplitude V of the speed is supposed to be equal to zero Indeed the speed of the aircraft is considered as large compared to the speed of the wind 017 The value of a z is obtained in the aerodynamic basis This basis normally rotates but the angles are considered as small and the basis is considered as 002xed The derivative of the aerodynamic climb angle is 001 015 a  001 a z V  It can be considered that the in\003uence of the wind is low if the resulting vertical displacement t 2 step 001 a z during a command step time t step is less than one tenth of the characteristic length of the aircraft The corresponding derivative of the aerodynamic climb angle is 0  009 rad/s The calculation is carried out for different f lim and the limit is reached for f lim  0  012 Hz  The frequencies below f lim have low in\003uence as shown in Figure 19 Results with the full simulation The Morris method is applied twice on the complete model and the results are averaged The two applications of the Morris method are based on the same 4 trajectories These trajectories cover the 49 factors all discretized in 4 values Figure 20 shows the location of the center of gravity of the aircraft and of the launcher for the 200 simulations of one application of the Morris method Figure 21 shows the points obtained with the Morris method and the percentages introduced in Section 4 representing the variability of the results To con\002rm the new process used for the Morris method the Sobol's method is applied on the 17 most important factors with 2304 simulations The 32 other factors are set to their average as the Sobol's method is not suitable for too large numbers of factors The ranks of the Sobol's indexes are shown in brackets for the most important factors in Figure 21 and Table 3 shows the complete Sobol's results 11 


Figure 20  3D trajectories of the aircraft and launcher Figure 21  Comparison of the Morris and Sobol's methods for the complete simulation The results obtained with the Morris and the Sobol's methods are consistent The Sobol's method show seven factors standing out and six of them are over the Limit 1 shown in Figure 21 However the interaction on the z axis of the aircraft ranked fourth with the Sobol's method is under the Limit 1 The interaction on the z axis of the launcher ranked eighth with the Sobol's method is on the contrary over Limit 1 Thus the Morris method can result in a type I and a type II error if the Limit 1 is chosen to distinguish the important factors These errors can either be due to the variability of the results linked to the samples used and revealed by the quite large percentages with different signs or they can also be due to the classic variability of the Morris between the different possible trajectories The Limit 2 more conservative should thus be used Most importantly the results obtained for the noise are equivalent in the two methods in spite of the arbitrary choices made for the Morris elementary effects of the noise The interaction on the y axis of the launcher on its center of pressure and on its z axis play a major role The free stream center of pressure of the launcher is very important as well As expected the opening problems of the hooks also have a large in\003uence on the dynamics and the time delay before the last hook opens appears as one of the main factors Finally another major factor is the initial slip angle of the 002xation between the launcher and the aircraft Table 3  Sobol's total order indexes for the complete simulation 1 Launcher Interaction/Y 0.477 2 Noise 0.364 3 Launcher Interaction/Center 0.317 4 Aicraft Interaction/Z 0.215 5 Hook/Time 0.203 6 Center of pressure 0.166 7 Slip angle 0.134 8 Launcher Interaction/Z 0.054 9 and following 0.053 0.045 0.028 0.019 0.012 0.006 0.006 0.003 0 Table 4  Sobol's total order indexes with the global in\003uence including amplitude 1 Interaction/Center 0.630 2 Interaction/Y 0.357 3 Noise  Noise/Amplitude 0.208 4 Mass/Aircraft 0.011 5 Interaction/Z 0.010 6 Interaction/X 0.002 7 Launcher/Mass 0 Global in\003uence including amplitude This method is tested with a simpli\002ed store separation simulation Two factors are 002rst used for the noise for a total of 8 factors The two noise factors are then merged leaving only 7 factors A different atmospheric context is de\002ned for this study While the uncertainty on the wind amplitude previously followed a uniform distribution on 0  4 0    this interval is now set to 0 0    The 002rst plot of Figure 22 shows the results with two noise factors and the second plot shows the results when these factors are merged The percentages representing the variability of the results and introduced in Section 4 are low enough to consider the results as reliable On the 002rst plot the two initial wind factors do not clearly stand out compared to the factors with lower in\003uence Merging them simpli\002es the calculation and most importantly shows that the global in\003uence of the noise clearly stands out Indeed the second plot shows that its average elementary effect is 2  5 times larger than the next one The two plots should not be directly compared and should be considered independently as they are based on different trajectories To con\002rm the results obtained with Morris when the two noise factors are merged the Sobol's method is applied with 512 simulations The same three factors stand out as shown in table 4 This illustrating example shows that this method can be an important tool However it is not applied on the full simulation because the in\003uence of the noise already stands out Subparts in\003uence This method is applied on the full simulation of the store simulation The simulation lasts 1  5 seconds and the store separation starts after 1  1 seconds The noise is 002rst divided in two equal parts one for the time interval 0 0    and one for 0  75 1    The in\003uence of each part of the noise is 12
