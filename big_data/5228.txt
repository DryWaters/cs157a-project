Fig 1 Conceptual Architecture of Cross-DB Search System collects the description of the objects metadata by harvesting several digital repositories Then metadata is used to nd the correlations 1 Spatio-Temporal Correlation The spatio-temporal correlation represents the possibility to nd datasets in a surrounding area and/or a speciìc point of time Consider two datasets a and b with a geographical area represented as a rectangle R 1 and R 2 for each dataset respectively Let  x 1 y 1  be the location of the bottom-left corner of R 1 and  x 2 y 2  be the location of its top-right corner Similarly let  x 3 y 3  and  x 4 y 4  be the respective corner locations for R 2  The intersection of R 1 and R 2 will be a another rectangle R 3 whose bottom-left corner is at  max  x 1 x 3  max  y 1 y 3  and top-right corner at  min  x 2 x 4  min  y 2 y 4  If max  x 1 x 3  min  x 2 x 4  or max  y 1 y 3 min  y 2 y 4 then R 3 does not exist i.e R 1 and R 2 do not intersect Then the spatial correlation C S between datasets a and b is deìned by C S  a b  1  2  R 3 R 1  R 3 R 2   If both overlap completely the result is 1 In case there is no intersection the result is 0 For temporal correlation the starting and ending time of the capturing data is considered For instance ST a and ET a represent the starting time and ending time for dataset a  respectively Temporal correlation C T between datasets a and b is deìned as C T  a b  1 2  t ET a  ST a  t ET b  ST b  1 where t is the overlapping time between datasets a and b  Finally the spatio-temporal correlation between datasets a and b is deìned by C ST  a b  C S  a b  C T  a b  2 2 2 Ontological Correlation The ontological correlation aims at nding datasets in related subjects and disciplines It is computed as follows 1 Clustering the datasets according to their similarity That is every dataset should belong to one or more clusters 2 With the knowledge of an expert each cluster is labeled and mapped to a speciìc class or concept in the ontology As our aim is to nd scientiìc datasets an appropriate public scientiìc ontology is the Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology ontology SWEET 3 Using a con v entional algorithm the score similarity between the nodes of the ontology is computed In this paper the ILIADS algorithm  is utilized That is all the connections among the nodes in the ontology have a score For instance the score for the connection from node x to node y is represented as S  v x v y   Then the ontological correlation between datasets a and b can be calculated as follows 1 Find the label of the cluster C a and C b for each dataset respectively 2 For C a and C b nd the class or concept associated say v a and v b  3 Calculate the distance between v a and v b by using the geodesic distance  which is the number of edges of the shortest path that connect them Let d  v a v b  denote the distance between v a and v b where v a v b  V  Obviously if v a  v b  then d  v a v b   Otherwise d  v a v b  S  v a v b   assuming that v a and v b are rst-degree distant 10 


Therefore d  v a v b  is deìned as d  v a v b  1  n  n  1  i,j d  v i v j  3 where n is the number of vertices in the path between v a and v b  Finally the ontological correlation between datasets a and b is deìned as C ONT  a b  e d  v a v b  where e is the base of the natural logarithm 3 Citational Correlation Data Citation DC refers to the relationship between web documents and datasets Citational correlation is used to discover set of datasets that are frequently cited It allo ws users to understand which datasets have been used for what purpose or in what other prior works The citational information is harvested together with the metadata and stored in a speciìc repository named Data Citation Archive Fig 1 Then a process for association rule discovery is e x ecuted on this repository to nd the te xtto-data associations between typical text-attributes contained in web documents and typical data-attributes contained in scientiìc databases Each association rule has its support value and the hub score for each text-attribute Citational correlation between datasets a and b is calculated as follows 1 Compute STP k  the strength of each path between datasets a and b  as follows STP k  hub i  supp i,j where k  K  K is the number of paths that exist between two datasets hub i is the hub score of text-attribute i  and supp i,j is the support value of the rule that associates text-attribute i with data-attribute j 2 Then count the total strength of all paths TSTP   k STP k  Finally the citational correlation between datasets a and b is deìned by C DC  a b    1 1 e TSTP  1 2  where e is the base of the natural logarithm III C OMPLEX J OIN S EARCH E NGINE The design of the Complex-Join search engine is based on a genetic algorithm GA This choice is motivated by the following reasons First the search space consists of all the datasets DS contained in the system Hence exploring the search space for relevant datasets can be seen as a highly dimensional problem that possesses a huge amount of local optima GAs are known for their robustness and their capability to rapidly explore noisy and large search spaces Second the stochastic nature of GA allows the search to keep and to discover diversity independently of the initial query A Analogy with Graph Theory In the proposed GA a candidate solution is a nite collection of datasets lying in the semi-ìnite space  If we see  as the graph  V E  where V is the set of nodes datasets and E is the set of edges that symbolize the correlations between the datasets then a candidate solution can be represented as the complete graph S  V  E   where V   V   V     v  1 v   V     and  E     e  1 e   E     Since the links can be seen as a distance measurement between two nodes and that the distance is in this case the strength of the correlations that links the datasets we will refer to the graphs as correlational graphs Each edge of E possesses NC components e i   e i 1 e iN C    i 1   E    that correspond to NC types of correlations B Problem Deìnition and GA Objective Function Given the set   the goal of the GA is to determine the optimal set S   V  E   such that V   V and 1 At least one type of correlations that connect one node to another is above a threshold thres corr for each node 2 The overall correlations that group all the nodes together is as high as possible 3 The number of nodes that compose V  is as big as possible 4 The diversity present in V  is as high as possible Formally the Complex-Join seeks an optimal or nearoptimal solution of the nonconvex optimization problem max S   f  S   where S is a candidate solution and f is a realvalued function that is also used as the GA objective function f  S  i a  MCS  S  i b  P LEN GT H  S  i c  DIV  S   4 where MCS is the mean correlation strength deìned as MCS   NC j 1 p j   S,j with  S    E   i 1 e i  E      S 1  S,N C  and p j  0  1 j 1 NC  MSC is thus the average of the correlation values for each type of correlation scaled by a preference factor p speciìed by the user P LEN GT H is the size of the biggest connected component of S  The connections of graph S can be represented by the adjacency matrix A  S   such that the term a ij   1  if max  e   ij    thres corr 0  otherwise  We then deìne for our case Given S  V  E    a subgraph C  V C E C  is a maximally connected component if C is connected and for all vertices u such that u  V and u  V C there is no vertex v  V C for which a uv 1  DIV measures the diversity in terms of provenance of the set of nodes V  In Equation 4 i a  i b and i c are the importance factors attributed by the user to each objective IV E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS WDS Pangaea Portal as well as Cross-DB have been queried using the same keywords for comparison The framework adopted in this paper is as follows First a list of ten arbitrary keywords mainly inspired from environmental science has been created By using each keyword Cross-DB and WDS have been queried separately and the amount of retrieved DS has been recorded in  Cross-DB  and  WDS   respectively The number of common DS to as well as the number of DS uniquely retrieved by both systems have also been tracked within  X  Y    X  Y  and  Y  X   respectively assuming X  Cross-DB and Y  WDS  Let  X  Y  and  Y  X  be the sets that represent the DS unique to Cross-DB and WDS respectively For each DS contained in the sets three experts were asked to judge whether the DS were relevant or not Let F be an arbitrary set of DS The relevance of a DS i of the set F is written r  F i  and takes the value 1 when F i is considered relevant 0 otherwise Then the relevance of the set F is equal to   F  i 1 r  F i    F   where  F  represents the number of elements in F  Similarly we have also evaluated the serendipity of CrossDB The serendipity is deìned in as being a measure of the extend to which a DS is considered as attractive and surprising for the user Therefore a serendipitous DS should not have been expected by the user but should also be useful 11

keyword are reported in Table II V C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK A framework for discovering correlated datasets from large-scale scientiìc data has been proposed It provides scientists with a quick selection tool and with improved comprehensibility with the results It relies on an enhanced GA as the core of the search engine which performs a multioptimization of several types of correlations among datasets Empirical comparisons between Cross-DB and WDS reveals that the result sets contains a proportion of common returned DS However it is the original DS unique to each system that highlight their characteristics Indeed our experimentations demonstrate that while WDS focuses on displaying documents that simply match a given keyword without much more strategy Cross-DB on the other hand emphasizes on the relations that exists between the DS contained in the result set For future work a lot of improvements are considered over the current proposed system 1 Let the users perform queries by example data That is the users are allowed to discover latent correlations among their own datasets and external datasets provided by the system 2 Since scalability is one of the most important issue to obtain more interesting results quickly a user-deìned harvester method has to be developed to include many different large and heterogeneous data repositories 3 Query processing can be extended by a concept dictionary for aggregating diversity for better performance Moreover sophisticated Natural Language Processing and text mining techniques may be added so that query processing can better capture the userês intention R EFERENCES  T o n y He y  Ste w art T ansle y and Kristin T olle eds The F ourth Paradigm Data-Intensive Scientiìc Discovery Microsoft

predecessor operators need to reproduce their output tuples Thus the recovery time for the operator i is determined by the predecessor who takes longer time to reproduce its output tuples as equation 9 shows For each of its predecessors j  the cost for reproducing the output tuples of j is reading data from disk if j is checkpointed  CK j 1  Otherwise if j is not checkpointed  CK j 0  j must be re-executed T R i  T  R i  T  R i 8 T  R i  max j  PRED i  T P j  T  R j   1  CK j  T C j  9 For the second part of the recovery cost T  R i  if the successor of operator i is a blocking operator i keeps the output tuples of received tasks until all tasks are nished As a result all tasks are re-executed if this operator is not checkpointed If the operator is checkpointed only the failed task which is running at the time the operator fails needs to be re-executed If the successor of operator i is a pipeline operator the output of a task is sent to its successor quickly So still only the failed task needs to be re-executed Objective Function Assuming that inìnite resources are used the expected runtime of an operator i is the sum of the processing cost of the operator T P i Eq 4 the expected runtime of its children the recovery cost T R i Eq 8 and the checkpoint cost T C i Eq 7 T i  T P i  max j  PRED i  T j  p i  T R i  T C i 10 PRED i  the set of predecessor operators of i p i  the probability of a failure for operator i  Obviously the expected runtime of a query plan T total is estimated by the following equation according to equation 2 where operator 0 represents the root of the query plan T total  F  V E CK P  T 0  T P 0  max j  PRED 0  T j  p 0  T R 0  T C 0 11 The objective is to nd the optimal checkpointing value for each operator to minimize the expected runtime of a given plan CK opt  argmin CK T total 12 D Heuristic Algorithm The straightforward approach to the problem is to generate all solutions in the full search space and get an optimal one However if the size of the query plan saying that the number of operator is n  is large this approach is not practical as the search space S G is 2 n  So we propose a heuristic algorithm using divide-and-conquer approach to reduce the search space Although the algorithm cannot produce the global optimal solution its efìciency is veriìed by the experiments   xy  CK x     y x 1 x 2 CK x2  CK x1  a simple plan b Fig 3 Example of Simple and Complex plan 1 Reduction of Checkpointing Candidates First of all we use a simple inequality to lter the operators which should not be checkpointed Letês rstly consider a simple sub-plan in which each operator has at most one upstream operator as Figure 3 shows Assume that a failure occurs at the operator y  the runtime of y depends on whether operator x is checkpointed  CK x 1  or not  CK x 0  When x is not checkpointed the recovery starts from the beginning and the runtime of y should be T total y  CK x 0  2  T total x  T  R y 13 With the checkpoint the recovery of y starts from read tuples from disk and the runtime of y with consideration of a checkpoint is T total y  CK x 1   T total x 2  t x  T  R y 14 t x is the I/O cost for reading/writing the output of x from/to the disk For n tuples the I/O cost is estimated as t x  T I/O  n  To get beneìt from making a checkpoint with a failure the runtime of y with a checkpoint should be smaller than that without a checkpoint T total y  CK x 1  T total y  CK x 0   2  t x T total x 15 Inequality 15 intuitively shows that the process of a query plan can gain from a checkpoint of operator i only if the checkpointing cost writing and reading the output of i is smaller than its execution time This observation generates the opportunities to reduce whole search space by setting CK i  0 if i does not satisfy the inequality Next letês consider a more complex sub-plan as the right side of Figure 3 shows Operator y has two predecessors x 1 and x 2 which are executed in parallel We take the following algorithm to decide the checkpoint values for x 1 and x 2  Sibling Checkpointing Algorithm rstly decides the checkpointing value for the operator with larger execution time denoted by i  according to the single Checkpointing function The checkpointing value of the operator with smaller execution time denoted by j  is decided by i s checkpointing value If i is not worth being checkpointed the algorithm thinks it is better for not checkpointing j because the recovery time for their parent is determined by the execution time of i  When i is checkpointed j is also checkpointed if the overall cost of the processing and checkpointing for j is smaller than that of 241

shown in Figure 11 The X-axis is the percentage of the normal completion time of Query 5 when a failure is injected Firstly it is not surprised that ParaLite is about twice faster than Hive One reason for the superiority is that not all the operators are checkpointed in ParaLite Moreover Hive uses sort-join while ParaLite uses hash-join In addition the start-up overhead for Hadoop cannot be ignored Hive uses 3 MapReduce jobs to express the query and each takes 10 15 seconds before all map tasks are started Secondly the slowdown for both system are similar However the slowdonw of Hadoop is limited to the interval of heartbeat message send to the JobTracker\(master from each TaskTracker\(worker After a x time we set it 30 seconds from receiving the last heartbeat if the master does not receive a new heartbeat message it sets the status of the worker failed and re-schedules the failed tasks So for a light-weight job whose execution time is not much larger than the interval the slowdown becomes larger because it needs to wait for the task re-execution On the other hand ParaLite detects the failure immediately after a process fails and then starts the recovery D Scalability To evaluate the scalability of ParaLite we perform TPCH Query 3 on 10 20 and 30 nodes with the s cale factor 100 200 and 300 respectively As Figure 12 shows ParaLite scales well with the increase of nodes The selective checkpointing mechanism adapts to clusters with different number of nodes                   0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 10 20 30 Execution Time\(s of nodes Fig 12 The scalability of TPC-H Query 2 VI C ONCLUSION To efìciently support intra-query fault tolerance for longrunning queries we propose a selective checkpointing mechanism which automatically chooses necessary operators whose output data are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the query in a failure-prone environment The mechanism provides a cost model to simulate the execution of the query plan and takes a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem The mechanism is implemented in a share-nothing parallel database ParaLite and evaluated with several TPC-H queries The experimental results rstly show that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Our selective checkpointing can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other fault-tolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than brute-force approach while keeping a

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
