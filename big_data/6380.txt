Exploitation of Minimum Risk System based on Artificial Neural Network open educational administration Guan Ping Beihua University Jilin, China E-mail:ping_g@126.com Abstract The basic function of a neural system is to intelligent learning from specific examples known as neurons It has great pattern adaptive capability that may be used to judge between old model and well model. Neural systems have many characteristics such as autonomous, uniqueness recognition of foreigners, noise tolerance, and distributed detection. Inspired by neural network system, Artificial 
Neural Network has emerged during the last decade. It is incited by many researchers to build, study, and design neural-based models for a variety of application regions Artificial neural system can be defined as adaptive model that is inspired by neural network, observed neural functions, mechanisms and principles. Association rule mining is one of well researched and the most important techniques of datum mining. The purpose of association rules is to refine interesting correlations, associations frequent patterns, or casual constructions in sets of aims in other datum repositories or the transaction databases Association rule is widely used in various regions such as 
telecommunication network, inventory control, intelligent decision, risk management and market analysis etc Artificial Neural Network is the most widely used algorithm for mining the association rules. In this paper, Artificial Neural Network is studied and optimized based on classification system. The performance of the ANN based on classification system is evaluated by varying number of generations and computing accuracy at different factors Three standard datum had been used to computer the accuracy. The test result shows that the system can give 
highest accuracy more than o.4 KeywordsNeural network; association rule mining Algorithm;confidence and support counting;classification system I I NTRODUCTION H EADING 1 Datum mining plays a more important role in the intelligent study making[1-3  Th e a i m o f  d a tum  m i n i ng is to refine some important information that is mixed in the already exists databases. Classification is a method of datum analysis that is used to refine model for distinguishing important datum or predicting the data

Associative neural network that uses association rule mining among the refine rule process has shown powerful advantage than many other classification ways[7 h e a i m o f a s s o c i a t io n  r u le s is to  refine frequent patterns, interesting correlations, casual construction or associations in sets of among the transaction datum In t h i s p a p e r  t h e t e c hni qu e fo r neural classification using ANN system had been

In this paper model free sequence design methods for maximum sampling have been researched. The ED & GA free design method was be used, because of considering computer construction models instead of physical phenomena The initial step is the datum preprocessing for neural datum mining work. Preprocessing is done to arrange the data in a order that can be easily processed. Datum structure was in the order of models containing records All the models are referred to as pointers. The datum contains series of items called nodes. There are various nodes available for representing nodes in a transactional datum. The node in a datum can be represented as a primary string with items binary 1 and items absent are binary 0. Consider the following example just in Tab. 1 containing 8 nodes from T100 to T800. the datum after each node is considered as one node. Now the nodes are presented in primary representation with 5 row and 8 columns. The nodes present in a transaction are coded as primary I and the nodes absent are coded as primary 0 TABLE I L IST OF FREQUENT NODES BASED ON SUPPORT LIMIT support confidence 11 12 13 14 15   1 1 1 0 0 1 42 55.34 2 1 1 1 1 0 42 55.34 3 1 0 1 1 0 18 27.35 4 0 0 1 1 0 42 44.935 5 0 0 0 1 0 18 27.35 6 0 1 0 0 1 18 27.35 7 0 1 0 1 1 18 40 8 1 1 1 1 1 18 40 9 1 1 0 1 0 16 30 The selection preprocess eliminates regulation with support nodes below the support limit. Before processing the datum, the association regulation mining algorithm for making frequent nodes are applied. If the maximum support limit is 25% then Tab.1 shows the list of nodes based on support limit and corresponding confidence TABLE II L IST OF FREQUENT NODES BASED ON CONFIDENCE LIMIT support confidence 11 12 13 14 15   1 1 1 0 0 0 42 55.34 2 1 0 1 0 0 42 55.34 3 0 1 1 0 0 42 27.35 4 1 1 1 0 0 18 44.935 5 1 1 0 0 1 18 44.935 The regulation is greater or equal to than the maximum confidence limit.

It gives the way for each high affinity node to study” more in order to make better its affinity. In applications proposed goal, the mutation node is equal to rebirth for each cell. That is, when a cell is mutated, the newly processed regulation will differ from the traditional regulation only by one rule. Tab.V shows the mutated clones by one bit mutation TABLE V M UTATED CLONED FOR EVERY ITEM SETS 12345 11000 10101 1101 10100 11001 11000 11100 11000 V N EURAL NETWORK DIVERSITY In order to use the diversity, the neural clone selection algorithm updates the application method by processing some existing nodes with other ones Computer sampling sequence model had been studied deeply. Many processes are so difficult that physical theorem too expensive or too time consuming; or, as in the case of weather model, physical theorem may simply be possible. As a result, theorems have increasingly turned to model to compute the intricate structure. Advances in computational efficiency have been allowed both more extensive and greater complexity use of this model Actually in many region of technology and science is affected. Computer data codes often have many dimensional inputs, which would be scalars or functions and the output can be multivariate. In particular, it is easy for the output to be efficiency-dependent function from which many responses are extracted. In the sequence of sampling systems, computer experiment is frequently the intricate approach to getting the solution plan. Typically the sampling sequence model of system performance is built based on knowledge structure of how the model operates The support of regulation is the transactions including X and Y with intersect the number of all domain. While confidence is seen as generalization or usefulness. How often the regulation is done. Support measures the uncertainty relationship. How certain the regulation is done. Tab.VI shows the mutated clones with their confidence and support

Members endowments Familys endowments Attitude of families to IT Attitude of neighbours to IT Adoption attention Fig.1.Information technology adoption model based on farmers endowments From the results above, age, education, family income family communication cost and job type affect farmers capacity of information technology adoption. Moreover perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude of neighbors to techniques affect farmers intention. Therefore the data mining of association rules behind will use these 9 factors to study farmers endowments impact on information technology adoption behavior and their adoption mode C. Mode of farmers information technology adoption based on association rules 1 Association rules are to look for the relationship among different variables in the database, and find out the frequent mode [11 Definition 1: Let   be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let transaction T be a subset of I i.e. I?T . Let  be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID. Let A be an itemset, and transaction T contains A, i.e. TA Definition 2: A rule is defined as an implication of the form BA? ?where IA ? , IB ? ,and ??BA ? . The sets of items A and B are called antecedent \(left-hand-side or LHS and consequent \(right-hand-side or RHS respectively Definition 3 : When BA?  is a rule in database D, it has to satisfy the minimum support S and minimum confidence C Support is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contains the itemset, i.e BAPS Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability  ABP Association rules generation is usually split up into two 


separate steps Step 1: minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database Step 2: these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules 2 In 1994, Agrawal with other scholars worked out Apriori algorithm. The core principle is that the subsets of a frequent itemset are still frequent itemsets and the supersets of an unfrequent itemset are still unfrequent. Moreover, Apriori is a kind of iterative algorithm which is based on a two-stage mining thought for frequent itemsets. In detail, Apriori uses a bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time \(a step known as candidate generation groups of candidates are tested against the data. From L1 to Lk the algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. But one attention of Apriori is that when searching for frequent subset Lk from Lk-1, connection and pruning will be done in the process. And finally association rules will result from the frequent itemsets[12 3 With software Weka3.5.8, some association rules between three information techniques \(call centre, SMS and network platform under the condition of probability=0.5, confidence=0.4 Therefore, some strong association rules with high confidence have been listed typically in Table.2 TABLE II.

The association rules reflect weak relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation. However farmers are still afraid of getting fake information b technique while age = young, job = planting, breeding and selling production, family income = high and public communication channels = wide. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers job, age and family income. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness.

while age=young, education=high, family communication cost=middle and family income=high. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, farmers are still worried about the attitude of neighbors around to their behavior 4.CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION From the mining results, we bring forward following conclusions A. Build various communication channels and provide differentiation information technology Farmers who have few communication channels dont want to adopt new techniques because of their limited family economic ability. We suggest government should try to reduce the risk and cost of technique adoption, promote various communication channels with different charging standards or provide some benefits of different degrees B.  Intensify farmers education and improve farmers certification of techniques Government should undertake some temporary training courses to instruct farmers some new information technologies for rural areas and let farmers be acquaint with these techniques. In this way, first farmers certification and then the information technology adoption rate will be improved C. Reduce technique cost and improve service quality It will do well in the technique promotion when the technique charging is lower and techniques are more various Moreover, considering that the service quality will influence farmers technology adoption intention and behavior information service institutions should try to perfect the quality through better satisfying farmers information demands and more reducing service cost. In this way, farmers information technology adoption will be promoted ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper is sponsored by Beijing forestry university Scientific and Technological Innovation Project BLRW200922 REFERENCES 1] Artesyn technologies: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Phone Covered 99.8% of Administrative Villages While Broadband Covered 96% of Villages and Towns. 3      December  2009. 20 June

Rules extracted from the third experiment where the associations between SNP genotypes and geographical regions are identified The M and m refer to major and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively  6. Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
