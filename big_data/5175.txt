225 Application of Data Mining in Bo iler Combustion Optimization  Ting-ting Yang, Ji-zhen Liu De-liang Zeng, Xie Xie School of Control and Computer Engineering North China Electric Power University Beijing 102206, China Ytt1229@hotmail.com   Abstract In order to improve boiler efficiency and reduce NOx emissions of a coal-fired boiler, a new solution strategy of combustion optimization is proposed is this paper. The key point of combustion optimization is the optimal setpoints of fuel and air parameters. As the development of electric industry, large amounts of history data are accumulated and data mining technique is applied to find some useful results Fuzzy sets theory is introduced into the association mining process in order to soften the partition boundary of the domain and generalize the data. And then cluster algorithm and fuzzy association rule are employed to obtain the optimal values of important parameters. The rules mined out are combined with control system of operation parameters and can be used to provide guides for operation. Experimental results in a 600MW power plant show that the method is useful and effective Keywords-combustion optimization; data mining; fuzzy association rule; cluster I   I NTRODUCTION  Thermal power unit is a very complex process system for its characteristic of multivariate, strong coupling nonlinear, large delay and uncertainty, optimal control of thermal power unit has always been a very difficult problem Boiler combustion process is the most complicated process in thermal power unit which changes continuously due to coal quality, boiler load, changes in slag/soot deposits, ambient conditions, and the condition of plant equipment. The quality of combustion has a direct impact on boiler efficiency and emission of polluting gas, like nitrogen oxides \(NOx NOx emission has been an important restrictive regulation in many countries in recently years. For instance in the Peopleês Republic of China, the current NOx emission limit for dry bottom boilers with a capacity of 300MW and larger is 650 mg/m 3 and it will decrease in the future [1  A s a con s e q u e nce the co n trol of NOx e m i ssion is widely concern as the utilization of fossil fuels continues to increase, especially in coal-fired power plants Recently, combustion optimization has been proved to be an effective way to realize low NOx combustion and high boiler efficiency in coal-fired power unit [2 vi ew of on-line plant data from distributed control system \(DCS and continuous emissions monitoring system \(CEMS\, the relation between NOx emissions  boiler efficiency and various operation parameters of the boiler is modeled using artificial intelligence such as neural-network, expert system fuzzy logic, generalized regression and support vector regression. And then, by combining the optimization approach such as genetic algorithm, information analysis and ant colony optimization, the model is applied to search the optimal operation parameters to achieve the two targets However, data used in the above methods should be got by many experiments in power plant which usually are hardly to realize for safe concern. And in some papers, some special data points are selected to construct models between NOx emissions  boiler efficiency and operation parameters Obviously, the results achieved may not be scientific With the development of supervised information system \(SIS\n China, more and more real-time data are sent to database and large amounts of data are accumulated Data Mining, sometimes referred to as knowledge discovery from databases, is a non-trivial process of identifying implicit, valid, novel, potentially useful and ultimately understandable patterns in data. Researchers and engineers attempt to apply it in industrial monitoring and control process and achieve great success. McGreavy and Wang X Z use the KDD techniques to identify the status of the chemical industrial process in Britain T ony Og ilv i e an d B W Hogg put forward method to establish the operating models in power plant by data mining techniques [5   In this paper, a complete resolution strategy for combustion optimization is proposed based on data mining technology. Steady operating data are selected and cluster technology is used to classify operating condition. Then fuzzy sets theory is introduced into the association mining for continuous data and optimal target values of some important operation parameters for combustion optimization is obtained to achieve the target of high boiler efficiency and low NOx emission  II  S TRUCTURE OF C OMBUSTION O PTIMIZATION  Among all the impacting factors of combustion process fuel and air parameters are the most important controllable parameters. Ratio of air flow and fuel flow is a key parameter affecting combustion condition in boiler. Proper ratio can guarantee complete combustion of fuel in boiler.

226 the ratio is too large, heat loss of the flue gas will increase which can bring decrease of boiler efficiency; meanwhile temperature of flame is not high and generation of NOx can be restrained. Otherwise, if the ratio is too small, fuel canêt burn completely and heat loss of boiler will increase. So for the target of high boiler efficiency and low NOx emission proper ratio of air flow and fuel flow must be concerned For the reason of fluctuation of boiler load and quality of fuel, ratio of air and fuel should follow the changes of ambient conditions, but not a constant. Then, under different operation conditions, how to judge the ratio of air and fuel flow? O 2 content in flue gas is used to solve this problem. O 2  content in flue gas directly reflects the condition of combustion in boiler. Air flow ratio-cascade control system in power plant is show inside the dotted line in fig 1   Figure 1. Control system of ratio of air and fuel flow and O2 content Now the setpoints of O 2 content and ratio of air and fuel flow f\(x\ are set by designed values of boiler. However, with changes of boiler equipment and ambient conditions, these values will not be optimal either for high boiler efficiency or low NOx emission. So data mining technology is employed in this study to approach the optimal setpoints of ratio f\(x and O 2 content. And the theory structure is shown in fig 1 III  D ATA M INING A LGORITHM  A  Steady Operating Conditon Operating condition of power unit is changing a lot and only data in steady state can be used for data mining. Steady state of a unit is defined as 1  Coordinated control system is on automatic control and important auxiliary equipments are running normally 2  Actual load and main steam pressure should be in steady state. The stability index of two parameters is defined as follows First, normalize the two parameter values  n k A A A k e B  2  1  min max       1 Where max A and min A are maximum and minimum of parameters in a period e A is rated value at rated load and k  is stability threshold The method used to judge parameterês stability is described as below. In a period of time \(such as 20 minutes equation \(1\hould be satisfied with a certain stability threshold, e.g 0.05 k   Otherwise, set start point and end point of the judging period to 10 minutes later, a new set of data containing 20 minutes operation conditions can be obtained. Then, judgment on stability can be made again A better method is the statistical analysis based on the ratio in \(1\. Assuming enough ratio data sequence B  are obtained 1 B   2 B   BN  N 20. Then the average value is  N BN B B B     2 1         2 Standard deviation  is calculated and then the stability index c x is obtained      1    2 N B Bi       3   B c x 3 When Bi  has been smaller than c x continuously for more than 20 minutes, the unit is judged as in steady state B  Fuzzy Association Rule Mining Algorithm In this paper fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the association mining for quantitative data in power plant. The proposed fuzzy mining algorithm first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set using membership functions. The algorithm then calculates the scalar cardinality of each linguistic term on all the transaction data using the temporary set f C The linguistic term with the maximum cardinality is used in later mining processes only thus keeping the number of items the same as that of the original attributes. The mining process based on fuzzy counts is then performed to find fuzzy association rules. The detailed mining algorithm is described as follows Input: A body of n transaction data, each with m  attribute values, a set of membership functions, a predefined minimum support value and a predefined confidence value The p th attribute in the j th n j   2  1    transaction can be described by k membership functions   p s j p R  k s   2  1    p s R k s   2  1   is fuzzy set Output: A set of fuzzy association rules Step 1: Transform the quantitative value j p t   m p   2  1   each transaction j T  n j   2  1    in D into a fuzzy set j p f So j p t is described by fuzzy sets as Volumn 2

If max p R  p 1,2 m   s equal to or larger than the minimum support, put it into the set of large 1-itemsets 1 L at is   max max 1   p p weight R L minsupport  1 m p   6 Step 5: Set 1  r where r is used to represent the number of items kept in the current large itemsets Step 6: Generate the candidate set 1  r C from r L  Restated, the algorithm joins r L and r L under the condition that 1  r items in the two itemsets are the same and the other one is different. The itemsets which have all their sub-r-itemsets in r L are put into 1  r C  Step 7: Do the following substeps for each newly formed \(r+1\itemset      1 2 1   r t t t t  in 1  r C  a\ For each transaction j T calculate its fuzzy value on  t  1   2  1   r   s       max max max 1 1 2 2 1 1       r r p j p p j p p j p j t R R R       7 Where j 1 to n.

It is expressed based on reasoning and is easy to be understood IV  A PPLICATION  Based on the history data of a 600MW power plant unit typical parameters which are related to combustion optimization are analyzed. The selected parameters include boiler load, coefficient of coal quality, ratio of air and fuel flow f\(x\, O 2 content, boiler efficiency, NOx emission Among of these parameters, coefficient of coal quality is a parameter constructed approximately reflecting quality of fuel, which can be calculated by unit load/total fuel flow Based on the steady condition, a total of 986 transactions consisted of parameters in different load condition in recent four months are obtained, which is shown in table 1 T ABLE 1  H ISTORY  DATA IN STEADY OPERATION CONDITION  TI D Load MW coefficient of coal quality Rati o f\(x O2 conten t boiler efficiency  NOx emissio n mg/m3 1 597.4 2.17 3.71 2.28 93.92 669.83 2 530.6 2.14 4.1 3.7 93.50 878.62 3 310.1 2.21 5.85 6.69 93.6 833.95 4 400.4 2.22 5.72 6.59 92.98 907.59 5 520.2 2.26 4.16 3.33 93.62 726.43         986 600.3 2.26 3.97 2.28 94.08 652.63  Volumn 2

The membership function of the O 2 content is shown in fig 2. Other parameters membership functions are similar with this one     Figure 2. The membership function of the O 2 content  The output of association rule algorithm is as follows when boiler efficiency is [93.7, 9 n d NOx e m iss ion  is  540.4, 709.95 f  x   is  4  36 4.9 7 an d O 2 content is 2.37, 2.64  wit h a support valu e of  0.1 86 a n d a conf i d enc e value of 57%. It satisfies the requirement of minimum support and minimum confidence. This rule means that when the load is in [584.68  ler eff icie n c y  is very high and NOx emission is lower, optimal range of ratio f\(x\ and O 2 content are respectively 4.36~4.97 and 2.37~2.64. By using the average method, optimal setpoints of these two parameters can be set at 4.67 and 2.51 The obtained setpoints of ratio of air and fuel flow and O 2 content in different load cluster was applied to the control system in fig 1. And the performance of boiler was improved obviously V  C ONCLUSION  Combustion optimization is the mainly method to improve boiler performance and decision of air and fuel parametersê optimal values is the key point in combustion optimization. In this paper, fuzzy sets theory is introduced into the association mining process in order to soften the partition boundary of the domain and generalize the data And then, fuzzy association rule algorithm is employed to find optimization setpoint values of important parameters of combustion process.

Moreover we can say that F C is comparable to E C and the modi\002ed version of E C i.e vE C  is correct and effective  The combinations of F C  E C  and vE C with 006 conf improve slightly F C  E C  vE C  and 006 conf  We can say that the sum of con\002dences is an important measure and these combined measures are useful in particular in the context where the accuracies of the classi\002cation by the sum of con\002dence by F C  and by E C are almost very good For conclusions 002rstly the adapted weight of evidence is a good class membership measure built on the gain of information F C  a measure built on the revisited 037 2 test provides another view of information gain It is comparable to the adapted weight of evidence The sum of con\002dence is a simple and natural measure with the good performance The combinations of the sum of con\002dence with the previous measures are interesting and useful to improve their performance Next based on the average accuracy values of different measures we recommend to use the combined measures because the average accuracy values of the combined measures are in general better than that of the non-combined measures Finally through the results on each dataset between the combined measures based on 037 2 and the weight of evidence we suggest the following propositions 017 For the 13 small datasets though the average accuracy value of cE C is slightly better than that of cF C  we can observe that cF C is much often wins cE C  Indeed cE C wins cF C on only 3 datasets while cF C wins cE C on 6 datasets Hence we can recommend cF C for the small datasets 017 For the 10 large datasets the average accuracy value of cvE C is slightly better than that of cF C  and cvE C wins cF C on 4 datasets and cF C wins cvE C 3 datasets Hence we can recommend cvE C for large datasets References  B Lent A Sw ami and J W idom Clustering association rules Proc Intl Conf on Data Engineering ICDE'97 IEEE Computer Society 1997 pp 220-231  W  Li J Han and J Pei CMAR Accurate and Ef 002cient Classi\002cation based on multiple class-association rules Proc IEEE Intl Conf on Data Mining ICDM'01 San Jose CA IEEE Computer Society 2001 pp 369-376  B Liu W  Hsu and Y  Ma Inte grating Classi\002cation and Association Rule Mining Proc 4th Intl Conf on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining KDD'98 AAAI Press 1998 pp 80-86  Y  Sun Y  W ang and A.K.C W ong Boosting an Association Classi\002er in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 18 no 7 IEEE Computer Society 2006 pp 988-992  J W ang and G Karypis HARMONY  Ef 002ciently Mining the Best Rules for Classi\002cation Proc SIAM Intl Conf on Data Mining SDM'05 2005 pp 205-216  J W ang and G Karypis On Mining Instance-Centric Classi\002cation Rules in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 18 no 11 2006 pp 1497-1511  Y  W ang and A.K.C W ong From Association to Classi\002cation Inference using Weight of Evidence in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol 15 no 3 2003 pp 764-767  F  Coenen The LUCS-KDD Implementations of the FOIL PRM and CPAR algorithms http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk frans/KDD/Software/FOIL PRM CPAR/foilPrmCpar.html Computer Science Department University of Liverpool UK 2004  Y  Basti de R T aouil N P asquier  G Stumme and L Lakhal Mining Frequent Patterns with Counting Inferences in ACM SIGMOD Explorations vol 2 no 2 2000 pp 66-75  R Agra w al and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules Proc 20th Intl Conf on Very Large Databases VLDB'94 Santiago Chile 1994 pp 487-499  V  Phan-Luong and R Messouci Building Classi\002ers with Association Rules based on Small Key Itemsets Proc 2nd IEEE International Conf on Digital Information Management ICDIM'07 France 2007 pp 200-205  J Quinlan and R Cameron-Jones FOIL A Midterm Report Proc European Conf on Machine Learning ECML'93 1993 pp 3-20  X Y in and J Han CP AR Classi\002cation based on Predicti v e Association Rules Proc 3rd SIAM Intl Conf on Data Mining SDM'03 San Francisco CA SIAM 2003 pp 369-376  C Cortes and V  V apnik Support-V ector Netw orks  in Machine Learning vol 20 no 3 1995 pp 273-297

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
