MEMORY-BASED HIGH-PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION FOR HIGH \nCONCURRENT DATA-INTENSIVE PROBLEMS \nMingzhu Deng Guangming Liu \nCollege of Computer \nNational University of Defense Technology \nChangsha, China \nNational Supercomputer Center \nTianjin, China \n{dengmz,liugm}@nscc-tj.gov.cn \n \nAbstract—Large-scale data-intensive problems characterized \nwith high task concurrency have overwhelmingly been on the \nrise, calling for higher computing efficiency. One solution for \nthis is to make use of high-performance computers. In this \npaper, we propose an optimization by constructing distributed \nfile system in big memory of nodes and rearranging compute \nnodes to greatly reduce repeated and redundant I/O and \nenhance memory usage as well as task parallelism. An example \nof information identification in a large database is given to \nillustrate its running process. A mathematical analysis is also \npresented to prove better performance gain of the proposed nsolution.  \nKeywords-high task concurrency, data-intensive, high-\nperformance computing, memory file system node rearrange \nI. INTRODUCTION \nCurrently the PetaFLOPS era of high-performance \ncomputing is dawning [1 Along with data explosion, large-\nscale data-intensive computing becomes increasingly \nimportant in industries such as petroleum, cartoon, and \nbioinformatics [2]. It’s worth to dig out a scalable solution \nby enhancing the execution parallelism. \nTraditionally, high-performance solution for data-\nintensive problem mainly focuses on the performance \noptimization of single task execution, leaving less attention \non highly concurrent problems. Most of optimal solution is \nsimple by serializing the many single task execution or nadding pipeline based on serialization, which lacks a deep \nanalysis.  \nWith the birth of the GFS [3], Big Table [4] as well as \nHadoop [5], problems are mitigated with the idea of Map-\nreduce[6]. However, MapReduce only is based on HDFS [7], \nrather than anything else, including the high-performance \ncomputers on Top500 making a waste of the great \ncomputing capacity. In order to confront the problem, a \nresearch has been done on how to employ high-performance \ncomputer to deal with high concurrent data-intensive \nproblem. \nThe use of high bandwidth and low latency during \ncommunication among compute nodes is proposed in \nreference [8] to distribute data to each node at run time. \nReference [9] proposes a collaborative cache to make use of \nthe client memory to improve the performance of the file \nsystem. Yong Chen et al. propose self-awareness of data nlayout to improve parallel I/O performance in reference [10]. \nAs for the memory part, much efforts have been made on the \nnetwork memory techniques by making effective use of idle \nmemory on cluster computers in [11 12]. Yue C et al, \nproposed a new way to support for memory adaptation in \nscientific applications in [13 while sharing the idle memory \nas a high-speed swap device on a cluster computer is adopted \nto decrease the cost caused by page swap on disk in [14]. In \nreference [15, 16], a new method is proposed for storage norganization by integrating all the memory of storage servers. \nH-store resets its approach to memory database [17]. \nIn this paper we propose a solution of high-performance \ncomputers by constructing memory-based file systems and \nrearranging compute nodes and then take Tianhe-1A \nsupercomputer as an example to illustrate the execution. The \npaper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes data scale \nof the problems. Section 3 details the proposed memory-\nbased framework. Section 4 illustrates the exact execution nprocess with the introduction of an example problem. \nSection 5 analyzes the performance gain of the solution nmathematically. Section 6 concludes this paper. \nII. DATA SCALE \nAs with the explosive increase of information, data-\nintensive computing problems with high parallelism are not \nuncommon on many fields like E-Logistics, E-government, \nE-commerce and ITS\(Intelligent traffic system in common are as follows: \nz Large volume. In times of big data, more and more \ndata-intensive problems are emerging and the data \nsize we are facing is larger and larger, as shown in \nTable 1. \nTABLE I.  STORAGE FOR TYPICAL APPLICATIONS \nFields Application Storage Size needed \nBiomedicine \nGenetic Sequencing 8PB \nDrug Development 200TB \nProtein Folding 1PB \nGeophysics Petroleum and Seismic Data Processing  50TB \nNuclear Simulation  of Nuclear Energy 1PB \nAtmospheric \nEnvironment Weather Forecasting 100TB \n n978-1-4799-0604-8/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE\nz Simple operation for a single task. For example, in \ncartoon rendering, almost all the files needed in the \nrendering process are very small and tiny. \nFurthermore, the operation on each file is simply \nconfined to read or write, excluding large and \ncomplex computing and communication.  \nz High task concurrency. Unlike traditional problems, \ncurrent data-intensive problems are involved with \nthe great uncertainty of task forwarding, thus \nrequiring a nearly non-stop system running. \nz Strict real-time requirement. Along with the \nsimplification of a single task, the real-time \nrequirement for each task is higher, moving from a \nmonthly or yearly schedule to a nearly instant \nresponse within minutes or seconds for each single \ntask. \nz Pressing call for potential scalability of storage of \nhigh-performance computer. Compared with \ntraditional data-intensive problems, which mostly \nhave few concurrent tasks and an almost fixed data \nset and pose no requirement for a great dynamic \nextension, the new problems, due to its high \nconcurrency and unpredictability of coming tasks, \nwill generate lots of temporary data and in 


ndesperation for storage, making it a big concern for \nthe system with respect for resource scalability. \nIII PROPOSED MEMORY-BASED OPTIMIZATION \nTaking into account of the high task concurrency and the \ngap between computing ability and I/O in high-performance \ncomputer, an optimization is needed to make better use of \nthe super memory and computing potential of high-\nperformance computers. The presented optimization is based \non its huge memory and scalability as well as the hyper-\nspeed communication network inside the supercomputers nA. Framework \nFigure 1 shows a general framework of the proposed \nmemory-based high-performance optimization In order to \nconfront data-intensive computing problems coupled with \nhigh concurrency, this solution, unlike traditional ways, \nmakes use of the large volume memory of high-performance \ncomputers by turning it into a nearly permanent storage to \ngreatly eliminate repeated and redundant I/O. \n \n \nFigure 1.  Proposed Framework nHigh-performance computers are abundant in nodes \nwhich are no difference from each. By rearranging compute nnodes to better serve the coming problems, we are trying to \nget a better performance from the system Actually, we \nproposed five different types of nodes in this optimization to \nbreak down tasks and realize job parallel executions. The \nfive types are user node, management node, storage and \ncompute node, global directory node and backup node. \nB. User Node \nUser node, as its name suggests, is mainly for the use of npotential users. The main emphasis of User node is to \nprovide a simple, friendly and secure environment for users \nto submit and handle their tasks either via a portal or a GUI-\nplug-in in a dedicated application. Its importance stands out \nfor its dealing with task submission and the original data so \nthat stability and reliability are of vital importance, thus a \nRAID is prepared for this. Commonly it receives the \nsubmission and put it into a maintained task status table, as \nshown in Table 2. It’s responsible for the data forwarding nand result gathering. \nTABLE II.  TASK TABLE \nUser \nID \nTask \nName \nTask \nID Status \nAlloc Node \nNum Partition Time \n94 ser.sh 101 Running 45 … 23 \n107 ji.sh 754 Running 21 … 1:45 \n… … … Pending 694 … 0 \nN 10542 Pending 298 … 0 \n \nC. Management Node \nManagement node, as shown in the Figure 1, is in charge \nof the management of the whole system, especially of \ncompute nodes. In order to facilitate the management, a \nTable of node status, as shown in Table 3, is kept within its \nmemory. Every node is numbered and classified into ndifferent categories. And smooth changes within different \ncategories could be made to transfer the status and type of a \nparticular node. For each node, it could be turned on when \nneeded and off when it’s spare according to the user’s need \nwhich is specified in a detailed job script. live nodes are \narranged into three types. Storage and compute node and \nglobal directory node are active while backup node is \ninactive as sleeping. And a good utility usage of node could \nbe maintained by management node. As for its reliability, a ncarbon copy node is running as its backup. \nTABLE III.  NODE STATUS \nNode \nNum Status \nMemory \nSize \nUsed nNode Type Task ID \n0 Running 30% 0\(Management Management Storage and Compute Storage and Compute Backup Global Directory Storage and Compute way to treat memory as a temporary \ndata storage, this approach takes part memory of compute \nnode as a permanent storage based on a long term \nobservation, where large memory in each compute node of nhigh-performance computers is not efficiently made use of. \nIn this paper, a compute node is used to store data \npermanently and do the computation. In order to make a \npermanent storage in memory of a node, Ramdisk is chosen \nto materialize a tiny file system which, technically speaking, \nis transparent to the end users All in its memory file system \nis all data from the disk storage, specifically data set needed \nin later computing. And the volume of the file system is \ndetermined according to the common usage of the memory nthrough feedback. The remaining memory from the file \nsystem could be used as a provisional place for temporary \ndata as it always does. Future work could be to optimize an \nalgorithm to better determine the volume and adjust the \nvolume dynamically. From a perspective of the entire storage \nof compute node cluster many tiny file systems are \nconstructed with each could either logically independent \nfrom one another or interconnected with each other when \nneeded. When independent, parallel computing could be \nprocessed among different nodes. When interconnected, \ncooperation could be made and data exchanged through \nhyper-speed network. With the permanent residence in the \nmemory, repeated and redundant I/O could be greatly \ndecreased saving time and enhancing efficiency. The \nconsistency of the file systems is guaranteed by a lock \nnamespace in its directory which is derived from the ideal of \ntraditional distributed lock manager. And in order to reboot \nor replace a crushed memory file system, backup of the \ndirectory is kept in the global directory node. \nE. Global Directory Node \nGlobal directory node takes care of all the memory file \nsystems by keeping directory backups and the job of address \nmapping. Practically, there is a spare one as an active backup nrunning for reliability. What is in its memory file system is \nonly a global Table for address mapping, as shown in Table \n4. Whenever some storage and compute node break down, \nthe directory in the global directory 


node could be used for \nmanagement node to reconstruct the dead node or replace it \nwith a backup node. Few modifications will be done to the \nmapping Table and multiple mapping could possibly be \ncarried out simultaneously, thus taking paralleling up to a \nhigher level. \nTABLE IV.

Backup Node nBackup node is mainly prepared for storage and compute \nnode. And whenever breakdown happens, its status will be \nchanged to make a replacement. Concerning the choice of \nthe node, a LRU algorithm is applied to start a replacement. \nWith the help of the global mapping table and specified \ndirectory of memory file system of the broken node, the loss \ndata could be retrieved and restored in a memory file system \nof a selected backup node. After that, the global mapping \ntable in the global directory nodes and node status table in \nthe management nodes will be modified. \nIV. EXECUTION \nIn this paper, we give a detailed description of the nexecution by taking an example of real-time search in a \nmassive database, which is centered somewhere with ncountless potential users connected to it through Internet. \nA. Problem Scale \nIn this instance, there are text information for general \ndescription and some biologically characteristic information \nlike a fingerprint for each item. For fingerprint of a certain \nfinger, a picture and some values need to be stored, as shown \nin Table 5. \nTABLE V.  FINGERPRINT DATA \na Single Finger Resolution Size\(KB value - 1-2 \n \nTherefore, around 2MB storage is needed for each person \nwhere nearly 1MB is taken up by the fingerprint information \nof ten fingers while the rest 1MB is occupied by pictures or \ntext of general information. \nAs for the scale, we could assume a database of ten \nmillion items, which is a minimal estimation far from real. \nThe whole space required is as shown in Table 6. \nTABLE VI.  SIZE OF DATABASE \nItem Amount Size per Item\(MB TB the \nchampion of Top500 in 2010, features a heterogeneous \narchitecture, representing MPP \(massive parallel processing could possibly be a \nuseful instrument in confronting problems mentioned above.  \nTABLE VII.  TIANHE-1A nNumber of Compute \nNodes \nMemory Size per \nNode\(GB TB Single Task \nA single task in our example is identification in the \ndatabase of Table 6, which includes precisely indexing and \nmatching. Indexing is carried out only according to the \ngeneral information due to the unavailability of fingerprint \nwhile the ensuing matching is only determined by fingerprint \ninformation nAs shown in Figure 2, in order to search, related data \nshould be loaded into the memory first and information to be \nidentified, which includes information of fingerprint and \ngeneral information, should be submitted to the user node \nbefore indexing by general information begins. A match is \nonly necessary if the index doesn’t fail, otherwise the task \nwill be terminated. After the match, result will be returned.  \n nFigure 2.  Flow of a Single Task. \nDue to the large volume of data, the key problem lies in \nhow to meet the demand of quick-time response and \nunpredictable task flooding. Due to an unforeseeable data \nscattering in a vastly large disk storage, a bad locality to \naccess data in the disk is easily envisioned even with a nhyper-speed network inside the system, which would no \ndoubt be worsened by task flooding. \nC. Execution \nThe running process is as follows: \n1. Management node updates the table of node status and \nrearranges the idle nodes according to the problem \nrequirement. The distributed memory file systems will \nbe built within storage and compute nodes. And data \nfrom disk storage will be distributed and loaded into the \nmemory file systems according to its volume and a map \nis coming into being in the global directory node. As \nshown in Figure 3. \n n \nFigure 3.  Data Access. \n2. After user’s submission, the task would be put into a \njob pool and FCFS strategy is applied to maintain the \npool. And the submitted data of ready task will be \nforwarded to the storage and compute nodes for match \nas well as global directory node for indexing and \naddress mapping. \n3 With the index in its own memory file system, the \nglobal directory node carries out the indexing and then nmaps the disk address into memory address and node \nnumber with the help of the global address mapping ntable. After that, converted addresses will be forwarded \nto particular nodes to do the match or result be returned \nto user node if it doesn’t hit. It’s shown in Figure 4. \n \n \nFigure 4.  Indexing and Address Mapping n4. When addresses from the global directory node and \nsuspected data copy from the user node are received by ndifferent nodes, matching will be done simultaneously \nand parallelly within different nodes. Then results will \nbe returned to the user node. As shown in Figure 5. \n \n \nFigure 5.  Parallel Matching in Storage and Compute Nodes \nTherefore a task is finished and whenever new task \ncomes, the flow will be repeated. Moreover whenever an \ninsert is necessary, data will be written first into the memory \nand then to the disk for data consistency with the help of lock \nnamespace mechanism and corresponding directory of the \nmemory file system will be modified. \nV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS \nIn this section, we give a mathematical analysis in theory \nto get 


a view of the efficiency of our optimization.  \nAs in the case of search, the time to process a single task n\(excluded the submission time 1 compt t t t   \(1 transfer time \( transfert compt the following sum of two components shown in \(2 2 computing time for a single task, compt is \nthe sum of indexing \( indexingt  nAnd before comparisons are made, several assumptions \nto facilitate the analysis is as follows: \nz The related system has a Lustre[18] file system and \nbandwidth of Lustre is ? , regardless of read and write nwhich based on the fact that MPP with Lustre is typical \non Top500. \nz Total task number is N and every search could be found \nfor analysis simplification. \nz In the optimization, the number of storage and compute nnodes is m and the maximum number of parallel \nthreads is q. \nz Volume for a single item in the database is p and ?  for \na single address. \nz After the indexing, the number of items after \nelimination is ? . \nz The bandwidth of the hyper-speed network inside, \ndifferent from the Lustre, is?  . \nz The latency can be neglected for the high transmission \nspeed. \nTherefore, total time consumption for N tasks with a \npipeline maximizing data transmission and computing, \nltotaT can be expressed as \(3 matchT t t N   \(3 t . \nAfter optimization, with loading all data fro?m disk to \nall the memory-based storage beforehand, the total time \nconsumption for N tasks \( ?totalT 4 match\ntotal\nN t N t\nT\nq m\n  \(4 node is \n× indexingN t\nq\n while the entire \nconsumption for matching, which is paralleled in many \nindependent storage and compute nodes is × matchN t\nm\n and \ntime for addresses transmission after addresses mapping nis\np\n? ?\n?\n×\n×\n. \nAs ? is practically big and ? × w comparatively small?\np\n? ?\n?\n×\n×\ncould be neglected and we substitute \(3 4 5 5 match\nindexing match\n1 1\(1 1 6 6 Speedup>1, proving the optimization \nenhanced the performance. \nOne step further: if N reaches 102 or more, we can get \(7 1 1 7 nNoticeably, further performance gain can be achieved \nwith the increase of task. \nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper, a memory-based optimization of high-\nperformance solution is proposed for highly concurrent data-\nintensive problems. The proposal rearranges the compute \nnodes into storage and compute node global directory node \nand backup node. In every compute node, a tiny file system \nis constructed in its memory with the help of Ramdisk for \npermanent data storage to make better use of the memory as \nwell as eliminate repeated and redundant I/O transmission. \nWith directory backup of each memory file system in global ndirectory nodes and backup nodes, the reliability of storage \nand compute nodes is guaranteed. Parallel execution of \nmultitask is highly improved by the computing independence \nof each storage and compute node And a mathematical \nanalysis is given through an example to prove better \nperformance gain of our optimization. Yet we have further \nwork to do, namely the dynamic adjustment of a more \nflexible memory file system and better availability and \nreliability at run time. Further down the line, we will be \nlooking at other large scale computing applications that may \nbenefit from the use of a memory-based high-performance ncomputing environment. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work was supported by the National Supercomputer \nCenter in Tianjin, China. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Amarasinghe S, Campbell D, Carlson W, et al.

iterations properly. Hence that situation might change\nsoon. Hama’s BSPMaster, on the other hand, waits for all\nprocesses to ?nish but does not appear to have timely heartbeat\nnoti?cation built-in.\nThese ?ndings lead us to the recommendation that under the\nassumption of high probability of node failure and extreme\nlong running jobs, a conservative choice of frameworks is\nsuitable.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we presented a thorough study of modern big\ndata frameworks and their application to graph algorithms.\nWe selected the k-core algorithm and adapted it to each\nplatform. We executed the algorithm both in a distributed\ncloud settings as well as on CPU rich multicore machines. Our\n?ndings con?rm the validity of these improved frameworks.\nEach of them improves over Hadoop in terms of execution\ntime. However, from a programming paradigm point of view,\na vertex centric framework is the better ?t for graph related\nproblems. Not only is the ease of programming an important\npoint, as the focus can be close to the sketched algorithm. The\nperformance of vertex-centric frameworks is not matched by\nMap/Reduce-based frameworks, even by improved ones, such\nas Stratosphere Therefore, we clearly recommend one of the\nPregel-inspired frameworks for graph processing, although the\nresilience of those frameworks has room for improvements.\nCompared to Hadoop, Stratosphere enhanced the situation\nenormously, thanks to their ?exible programming contracts\nconcept. For graph algorithms, the MATCH operator as a\nmean to split input into worksets and graph input yields clear\nperformance gains. An important announced, but still missing\nfeature of Stratosphere will be the PACT compiler support\nfor worksets. With that feature available, Stratosphere might\nbe able to catch up to vertex centric frameworks, using highly\noptimized data?ows; however, the ease of programming might\nstill be an issue. We therefore recommend a re-evaluation at\nthat point.\nAnother outcome of this work is an improved dynamic\nprogramming algorithm, which greatly improves the runtime\nof k-core. Future work on graph algorithms might consider\nthe ?ltering concept as a possible source for improvements.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work has been partially supported by the EIT Activity\n“Europa” n. 12115 and by an AWS in Education Research\nGrant Award and by\n66\nREFERENCES\n[1] Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2  and A.

stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
