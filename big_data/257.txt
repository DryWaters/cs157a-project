to deal with quantitative attributes in time series databases This kind of rules named as Association Rules of Quantitative Movement Pattern AR-QMP can represent relations of movement patterns about quantitative attributes We first analyze the necessity of new association rules Secondly we design a model to describe the movement pattern and present implementation strategies based on this model In the end we propose further work to discover predictive association rules aboul movement patterns Keywords Association rules, association rules 
of quantitative movement pattern, AR-QMP quantitative attribute 1 Introduction Since the problem of mining association rules was introduced in I a large amount of work has been done to finc relations among attributes in various directions. The original application of association rules is market basket analysis using transaction databases from supermarkets and departmental stores R Srikant and R Agrawal named them as 223Boolean Association Rules\224 for the domains of attributes are restricted to boolean domains 
Srikant and Agrawal 3 proposed \223Quantitative Association Rules\222\222 to mine association rules from quantitative and categorica attributes To quantitative attributes R J Miller and Y Yang 4 presented a new definition of association rules They suggested to cluster quantitative attributes and then to generate rules according to the distances among clusters Those explorations can help users to find relations among quantitative attributes. Despite these efforts there is an important form 
of association rules which are useful but can not be discovered with the existing association rule mining framework For example the following rules are more interesting to people The rate of exchange of some stock rises 15 then its closing price may rise 10 The netprojit 
of a commodity will improve 5 to 10 if its discount is set to 5 In radiation experiments of patients the number of leukocytes will improve 2 in jive days caused by adding 10 dose of a medicament Unfortunately, current association rules mining over quantitative attributes cannot discover this type of 
rules If a quantitative attribute varies time its change may affect other attributes\222 movement like these rules given above Sometimes we care for quantitative rules much more than qualitative ones. While those existing methods focus on mining associations among attributes in the relational databases and they cannot discover relations among movement pattern of quantitative attributes Moreover rules mined by various methods should be available under some time restraint So dding time restraint to 
association rules will improve applicability and reflect objectivity of real life To deal with these shortcomings we present a new form of rules, association rules of quantitative movement pattern abbreviated as AR-QMP which inchde the following features comparing to classical association rules Consider relations among varying trends of quantitative attributes Consider available periods of time over rules 0-7Y03-7010-4/01/$10.0002001 1EEE 32 


We design a movement pattern model over which AR-QMP can be discovered By using this model we transform time series databases into changing ratio databases and then apply extended classical mining methods to find new knowledge In this paper we research the problem of mining AR-QMP We present a formal statement of the movement pattern model in section 2 In section 3 we propose the implementation of AR-QMP An experiment report is listed in section 4 Further work and conclusions are given in the end 2 Model statement Let S=<Pl Pz   Pj    Pk   be a quantitative sequence ordered by time Pj is the value of the jth element. We need to get changing ratio of each Pj over S Using variable Tgap to represent the length of a sliding window, each calculated element and its comparing object are in a sliding window simultaneously Definition 2.1 Let T,,=N MBi is the maximum from Ti-N+l to Ti i.e MBi  MAX Pi MAi is the maximum fiom i-N<j<i Ti to i.e MA  MAX pi  mbi is the minimum fiom T~-N+I to T i.e mbi  MIN Pi  mai is the minimum i<j<i+N i-N j<i from Ti to Ti+~-I i.e mai  MIN Pj  Definition 2.2 Let T,,=N is j<i+N 6MBi is the ratio of Pi compared to MBi and DMB is time distance between Pi and the nearest MBi to Pi if having several MBi i.e 4 MBi 6MBi  ___  DMB MBi Tj\(lfs  j  MAX\(k I Pk  MBi SMAf is the ratio of Pi compared to MA and DMBi is time distance between Pi and the nearest MAi to Pi if having several MAi i.e SMA  MAi  DMAi q Ti  j  MIN\(k I Pk  M4 MAi 6 is the ratio of Pi compared to mbi and Dh is time distance between Pi and the nearest mbi to Pi if having several mbi i.e 4  mbi mbt  7  Ddi=T-Tj\(iff j=MAx\(kIP mbi 6 is the ratio of Pi compared to mai and Dm is time distance between Pi and the nearest mi to Pi if having several mab i.e 9  mi 6 nuli   Dmi Ti Tj  j  MIN\(k I Pk mi Because 6 and D is closely related we put them into a unit Thus four kinds of units can be achieved which are  SMBi  DMBi   2iMi  Dmi   adi Dmb  and  Smai  Dmi  We denote them as a i fi i Y i and i which are available in the sliding window Tgap We can transform the original sequence S into four ratio sequences composedof ai Pi iand Xi Definition 2.3 Let T,,=N define mi 33

This type of association rules is abbreviated as AR-QMP According to these descriptions we give a definition to AR-QMP 3 MiningAR-QMP In order to mine AR-QMP first we need calculate the maximum or minimum changing ratio on quantitative attributes in a user-specified time window Secondly we should handle \223Quantitative Association Rules\224 on ratio sequences Considering these ratios are numeric and continuous, they need to be divided into several classes and each class is mapped to a boolean domain Ultimately the question is viewed as a 223Boolean Association Rules\224 We decompose the AR-QMP question into three sub-questions as shown in figure 1 I 1 I I I I Figure 1 AR-QMP decomposition We solve the problem of discovering AR-QMP in five steps Step 1 Data sorting.The database is sorted with sequencsid as the major key and time as the minor key The sequence-id may be transaction-id or other identifier-id such as stock-id in stock market data set customer-id in sales data set Step2 Time processing Some elements of a sequence occur at interval time but they are continuous. For instance, the stock market in China doesn\222t open in Saturday and Sunday The time difference between data on Friday and data on next Monday is 3 but we consider the time distance is 1 not 3 Thus under some condition we can\222t use true time difference to denote the time distance. So we propose two strategies to pre-process time Map time into a series of integer started from zero The smallest time in the series database is mapped into zero other time is mapped into difference between it and the smallest time Use record index in the database to replace occurring time starting from zero In the other steps we can get time distance by using the difference between two-mapped time while not considering they are true time or record index 34 


Step 3 Data changing ratio calculating.According to user-specified parameters i.e sliding window Jap base attributes attached attributes changing type a  B i d i or 1 i  we achieve the maximum or minimum changing ratios over base attributes and attached attributes in the scope of a sliding window And time distance is recorded also This step converts the original time series database into a database of quantitative movement ratios For instance to achieve the a sequence, supposing the sliding window is Tgap, attribute I is a base attribute the naive idea is 1 Scan the first Tgap find the maximum MBI on I Then the ratio is got by using the formula of tiMB  2 Move backward an element, repeat step 1 in the new window scope till reaching the end of database Obviously its efficiency is very slow A fast method is given as follows, which records each potential maximum element during scanning elements in the sliding window We use a queue to store potential maximum elements The queue has some features listed as follows Each potential maximum is a wave-top which value is larger than its previous and next elements When moving the window backward the verge points are processed as potential maximum elements whether they are or not The elements in the queue are descended-order from the point of value view and ascended-order from the point of time view The improving method is described as follows 1 Scan the first Tap and insert potential maximum elements nto the queue by a descending order When inserting a new element into the queue, its back elements will be removed from the queue That is to say each new inserted element will be set to the tail of the queue for its back elements cannot be maximum values For example the current queue is <15,12.4,8.3,5>, the element which will be inserted is 9 After inserting the queue is 15,12.4,9 2 Compute the changing ratio between the tail of Tgap and the head of the queue. Moreover calculate the time distance between the two elements 3 Move the window backward an element, and insert the new tail element of Tgap into the queue 4 Judge the head element of the queue whether is still in Tgap. If it has left the sliding window scope we need compare its next element in the database with the second head in the queue. Supposing its next element in the database is A the second head in the queue is B If A is larger than B then A will replace the head's old value Else B will be the new head in the queue For example the current queue is 15,12.4,8.3,5 After moving the sliding window 15 is not in the new window scope In the database if the next element value after 15 is 13.8 the queue is <13.8,12.4,8.3,5 But if the next element value after 15 is 12, the queue is 12.4,8.3,5 5 Repeat step 1\to 4 till reaching at the end of database Step 4 Data discreting To continuous attributes we cannot apply mining algorithms to discover association rules directly We need to divide the range of the-quantitative values into intervals and then map each attribute interval> pair to a boolean attribute For example attribute X is divided into three intervals XI X2 X X3 and X3  a If X,\200 X X3 then attribute X-1 is set to 0 attribute X-2 is set to 1 and attribute X-3 is set to 0 Some articles have discussed this task 13 We can select some classical clustering methods, such as Kmeans BIRCH 517 61 which can help us to divide continuous values satisfactorily 35 


Step 5 Mining rules with extended Apriori algorithrn.The elements in sequences a  B  6 or h have time distance After transforming them into a boolean database we can consider a boolean item as boolean-attritube, time distance> pair The extended Apriori algorithm can be applied on the transformed database These modifications list as follows When we join Lk.1 with Lk to generate candidate set C the joint conditions are that the first k-2 items are same and the time distances of two pair are equal also In counting each candidate of C on the transformed database we increase the count of a candidate if and only if all items and time distance of this candidate appearing in a record According to our requirements in discovering association rules the user -specified minimum support and confidence must be smaller than mining classical association rules But in reality these rules with time restraint have a wide application Parameter Description Number of Record Number of Stock Size of Data set Data Set 1 Data Set 2 107374 214963 141 277 12.7 M 25.4 M 5 In section 3 we propose AR-QMP which is discovered over changing-ratios sequences and represent relations among quantitative movement patterns. In the step of getting changing ratios we can see Each changing-ratio closely relates with time On different time points in the database a quantitative attribute has a relevant changing value The disperse changing-ratios of an attribute get together, which can reflect its movement trend at a whole Further work discovering prediction AR-QMP Based on this we present a shifting joint method to find predictive association rules After calculating sequences U  6 d or X of several attributes we connect them with shifting while not according to the original record indexes. Next applying extended Apriori on the new database to get predictive rules We use stock market data to verify our proposal Set the Tgap is 60 calculate d of exchanging rate and 1 of close price set both attributes to be base attributes. Then we connect the first data of Y to the seventh data of A shown in the figure 2 Applying the extended Apriori algorithm we get such rules as follows Change-B-Min 1 5 2 5  3 3 Close-A-Min  1 0 1 5  5,7 This rule can be interpreted as if the three-days improving ratio of exchanging rate is between 15 and 25 sup  5 5   Conf 8 0  seven days later the five-days improving ratio of close price is between 10 and 15 Step Calculation changing ratio Data cluster Transformation to boolean database Generation rules 36 Runnin time s Calculation chan in ratio Data cluster Running time s 327 1780 159 Transformation to boolean database 979 Generation rules 1958 


Such rules are predictive and now we are checking up their exactness and practicability in the histow data from the stock No Close A Min No 1 2 7 8 9    I I Figure 2 Shifting Connection 6 Conclusion and remarks In this paper we present more useful rules association rules for Quantitative Movement Pattern These rules can present relatives among quantitative movement trends of attributes Mining association rules for QMP is a computationally intensive problem which requires much more search efforts compared to the traditional association rule mining In order to find such rules easily we propose a mGdel to transform series database into ratio database On this model we can apply our time-constraint method We are modifying the computing model to mine prediction rules This work will be verified in the near future References 1 R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proc ACMSIGMOD Conference Management of Data pages 207-216, Washington D.C USA May 1993 2 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proc of the 20 Confireme on VeT 3 R Srikant and R Agrawal Mining quantitative association rules in large relational tables In Proc of the ACM 4 R J Miller and Y Yang Association Rules over Interval Data In Proc ACM SIGMOD Conference 5 R T Ng and J Han Efficient and Effective Clustering Methods for Spatial Data Mining Proc of VLDB 1994 6 T Zhang R Ramakrishnan, and M Livny Data Clustering System BIRCH and its Application 1997 Large Data Bases pages 478-499, Santiago, Chile, September 1994 SIGMOD Conference Management of Data pages 1 12 Montreal, Canada, June 1996 Management of Data pages 452-461, May 1997 37

is that this requirement is sufficiently performance oriented to meet the requirements for old installations according to the 1987 NEW Requires draw-out circuit breakers to be inserted and removed while in the open position and that if the design permits the control circuits be rendered inoperative while breakers are being inserted and removed stated in the Rules and requests that existing installations not be required to be modified to meet NESC APPA recommends that Section u 4 i which includes requirements for enclosing electric conductors and equipment to minimize unauthorized access to such equipment be modified to refer to only those areas which are accessible to the public Requires conductive fences around substations to be grounded Power Generation v Addresses guarding of energized parts  Fences screens, partitions or walls This section provides additional requirements and related work practices for power generating plants  Entrances locked or attended Special Conditions w  Warning signs posted  Live parts greater than 150 volts to be guarded or isolated by location or be insulated  Enclosures are to be according to the 1987 NESC Sections llOA and 124A1 and in 1993 NESC  Requires guarding of live parts except during an operation and maintenance function when guards are removed barriers must be installed to prevent employees in the area from contacting exposed live parts Requires employees who do not work regularly at the substation to report their presence Requires information to be communicated to employees during job briefings in accordance with Section \(c of the Rules Comments U APPA and EEI provide comments as follows Both believe that some older substations \(and power plants would not meet NESC as This paragraph proposes special conditions that are encountered during electric power generation, transmission and distribution work including the following Capacitors  Requires individual units in a rack to be short circuited and the rack grounded  Require lines with capacitors connected to be short circuited before being considered deenergized Current transformer secondaries may not be opened while energized and must be bridged if the CT circuit is opened Series street lighting circuits with open circuit voltages greater than 600 volts must be worked in accordance with Section q\or t and the series loop may be opened only after the source transformer is deenergized and isolated or after the loop is bridged to avoid open circuit condition Sufficient artificial light must be provided where insufficient naturals illumination is present to enable employee to work safely A2-17 


US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
