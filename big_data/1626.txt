Co-\nlocations or sets of spatial events which are frequently observed\ntogether in close proximity, are particularly useful for discovering\ntheir spatial dependencies. The computation of co-location mining\nis prohibitively expensive with increase in data size and spatial\nneighborhood. In this work, we propose to parallelize spatial co-\nlocation mining on distributed machines. A framework of parallel\nco-location mining based on MapReduce is presented.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe evolution of location sensing, mobile computing, and\nscientific simulation is generating huge quantities of rich\nspatial data. Examples of such data include geographic search\nlogs, GPS logs, environmental/climate measurement data and\ndisease occurrence records. Spatial association mining has\nbeen popularly studied for discovering certain association re-\nlationships among a set of spatial attributes and possibly some\nnon-spatial attributes [3]. A co-located event set represents a\nset of events which are frequently observed together in nearby\narea [4]. Because of complex spatial data types neighbor\nrelationships on continuous space and spatial autocorrelation,\nco-location mining presents challenges with increase of data\nsize. The major computational task is finding co-located in-\nstances having various spatial neighbor relationships from\na given spatial dataset. Although many co-location mining\nalgorithms have been developed, the computation involving\nin filtering co-located instances is inherently demanding in\nboth processing time and space requirements. In this work,\nwe propose to parallelize co-location pattern mining so as\nto deal with large-scale spatial data. Modern frameworks\nfacilitating the parallel and distributed execution of massive\ntasks are becoming increasingly popular since the introduction\nof MapReduce programming model, Hadoop run-time environ-\nment and distributed file systems [1]. In this work, we present\na framework of parallel co-location mining over MapReduce.\nII. A FRAMEWORK OF PARALLEL CO-LOCATION MINING\nGiven a spatial dataset, a neighbor relationship, and a\nminimum prevalence threshold, the proposed algorithm discov-\ners prevalent co-located event sets through three MapReduce\nphases. MapReduce [2] is a distributed parallel processing\nmodel and execution environment for processing large data sets\non clusters of commodity machines Fig. 1 shows our algorith-\nmic framework for parallel co-location mining on MapReduce.\nIn Phase I, the mappers divide input spatial objects according\n6HDUFKQHLJKERULQJREMHFWV\nQXOOQHLJKERUSDLU!\nSDUWLWLRQBQR\nREMHFW!\n*HQHUDWHQHLJ KERUKRRGWUDQVDFWLRQV\nUHIBW\\SH\nQHLJKERUSDLU!QXOOQHLJKERUSDLU!\nQXOOHYHQWREMHFW!\nQXOOQHLJKERUUHF RUG!\n QWVHW\nSUHYDOHQFH!QXOOQHLJKERUUHFRUG!\n0DS\n&ROOHFWFDQGLGDWH\nLQVWDQFHV\n5HGXFH\n XWHSUHYDOHQFH\nPHDVXUH\n VHW 0DS 5HGXFH\n0DS\n287387\n1HLJKERU\nGLVWDQFH\nSUHYDOHQFH\nWKUHVKROG\n&KHFNQHLJKERU\nFRQVWUDLQWV\n5HGXFH\n&RXQWWKHREMHF W\nLQVWDQFHV\n6HDUFKDOO\nQHLJKERULQJSDLUV\n$VVLJQDSDUWLWLRQ\nQRWRGDWDREMHFW\n1HLJKERUSDLUV\n0DNHDQHLJKE RU\nOLVWSHUREMHFW\n^?????????^Ž??\n^?????????^Ž??\n^?????????^Ž??\nSDUWLWLRQBQR\n>REMHFW@!\n$VVLJQUH IHUHQFH\nW\\SHWRQHLJKERUSDLU\nUHIBW\\SH\n>QHLJKERUSDLU@!\nFig. 1.

However, this naddressing is currently limited to one node. \nGAS Net supports the partitioned global address space \n\(PGAS model of programming with distinct shared and \nprivate memory regions \(as drawn in yellow in Figure 1 nprimarily focused on improved programmability across a wide \nvariety of cluster interconnects. However GASNet currently \ndoes not focus on data movement between accelerator and host \nmemory. Research into the Phalanx model [10] has extended \nGAS Net with a programming model approach for using GPUs \nand doing data transfer with GAS, but it is unclear if this GPU \nsupport will be merged back into the core GAS Net API. Also nboth GASNet and Phalanx are limited by their programming \nmodel that requires the use of UPC-style primitives to fully \ntake advantage of the underlying GAS model. The use of \nthese primitives may require substantial rewrites for business \napplications. \nFrom a virtualization perspective, the rCUDA project \(rep­\nresented as a software virtualization layer in Figure 1 data transfers using TCP/IP, InfiniBand, and NVIDIA's \nGPUDirect [11], but it focuses more on the computation aspect \nof GPU virtualization rather than a cluster-wide aggregation \nof resources. A closer analogue to our ideal GAS model for \nhost memory and accelerator memory can be found in the data \ntransfer support found in MEMSCALE \(also shown in yellow \nin Figure 1 project includes support for using \nGAS across host memory for standard transactional databases, \nand the hardware-supported GAS provided by the EXTOLL \nnetwork is used both by MEMSCALE and by On cilIa.

GAS GPU Cluster System Model \nrelated project, GGAS [12] uses EXTOLL and GPUDirect to \nsupport GPU-based GAS. \nAll of these projects provide different solutions for sup­\nporting data movement for multi-node applications, but they \nare typically focused on the high-performance community and \ndevelopers who already have a detailed understanding of data \nmovement APIs \(e.g., InfiniBand Verbs, MPI, TCPIIP sockets coordination of cluster VO, \nmemory, and network resources with an API that provides the \nsimplicity of NVIDIA's UVA, as currently supported on one \nnode. \nIII. SYSTEM MODEL \nAs shown in Figure 2, the generalized system model used \nwith an Oncilla-supported cluster combines the host memory \n\(DRAM resources accelerator memory \(GDDR Access to this aggregated memory in a high­\nperformance manner is supported by low-latency and high­\nbandwidth hardware that supports the one-sided put/get model. \nWhile overall application performance may be affected by the \nlocation of remotely allocated memory, application scaling is \nnot restricted by where the memory is physically located. \nOur implementation of this system model combines several \ndifferent hardware and software components to create a high­\nperformance and commodity solution for allocating remote \nmemory and sharing it more efficiently between cluster nodes. \nThe hardware supported GAS in our model is built around \nEXTOLL network interface cards \(NICs for \ndata allocation and movement and the Red Fox compiler for \ncompilation and optimization of data warehousing application \nkernels for the GPU. \nA. Red Fox compiler framework \nThe Red Fox compiler is designed to run complex queries \nwith large amounts of data for a heterogeneous cluster and \nis focused on optimizing computation kernels that run well \non highly parallel architectures, such as GPUs. As Figure 3 \nshows, Red Fox is comprised of: 1 Primitive CUOA \n?'----v----' \nCPU GPU \nHost Accelerator \nFig. 3. Red Fox Compiler Flow \noptimized query plan in the fonn of a graph of relational \naJgebra \(RA compiler to map these RA primitives to their corresponding \nGPU kernels using NVIDIA's CUDA language [13] 3 nkernel optimization component caJJed Kernel Weaver that \napplies Kernel Fusion/Fission \(KFF reduce \nthe amount of data transferred to the GPU and to overlap data \nmovement with computation [14] [15 nPrevious work has shown that database computation maps \nwell to GPUs due the parallel nature of many operations \n[16], and more recent work with Red Fox's Kernel Fusion \noptimization has helped to reduce the overhead of transferring \ndata over the local PCI Express \(PC Ie over the same input set. While \nKernel Fusion can help to mitigate some of the effects of Big \nData by limiting the number of PC Ie data transfers, the transfer \nof large in-core data sets to smaller GPU global memory is \nstill limited by the efficiency of data transfer between cluster \nnodes. The Oncilla runtime discussed in Section IV aims to \nprovide this efficient inter-node data movement mechanism. \nB. The EXTOLL Networking Fabric \nEXTOLL [17] is a network fabric that allows for the \noptimization of network characteristics to support speciaJized \nnetworking tasks, including the consolidation of resources \nand low-latency data transfer between nodes. The two most \nrelevant aspects of EXTOLL are its support of global address \nspaces \(GAS 


low-latency hardware path and one-sided \ncommunication with remote resources, global address spaces \ncan be spanned up across any number of nodes. From an \napplication's perspective, local and remote accesses cannot nbe distinguished based on location, but such details can be \nexposed in the programming model for locality optimizations. \nThese global address spaces can be used for dynamic resource \naggregation, thus breaking up the standard static resource \npartitioning associated with cluster computing. In particular \nin-memory data-centric applications like data warehousing \ncan benefit from the vast amount of memory provided by \nsuch aggregated resources [S]. In addition, both CPUs and \nother components like accelerators can access global address \nspaces for resource aggregation. As disaggregated memory \nresources cannot easily provide the capacity required for data­\nwarehousing applications, here we use global address spaces \nfor resource consolidation purposes to keep data as close to \nNode 1 Node 2 \n Source memo? \nFig. 4. EXTOLL Remote Memory Access Dataflow \nthe processing units as possible nWhile put/get operations are provided by many different \nnetworks, the one-sided communication operations in EX­\nTOLL are optimized for fine-grained communication schemes \nand high-core counts. First, the overhead associated with \nregistration/de-registration and initial communication costs \nare minimized. Secondly in-hardware virtualization supports \nmulti-core environments without intermediate multiplexing \nsoftware layers. Features that have proven to be beneficial for \nHPC applications also are useful for resource consolidation \npurposes: the need to keep memory ranges registered is low, \nas the registration process is very fast \( 2 f.LS vs. 50 f.Ls \ninitiaJ overhead for small memory ranges when compared \nto IE [IS registration requires pinning pages in main \nmemory, too many registrations can reduce the number of page nswap candidates and significantly impact demand paging and \nsystem-level perfonnance. Also, while many put/get semantics \nprovide few possibilities for notification about completed op­\nerations, EXTOLL provides notifications on both sides \(origin \nand target very little overhead. In this work, this feature helps to \nmaximize overlap among the various communication flows. \nThe EXTOLL NIC currently supports three styles of data \ntransfer: 1 SMFU  memory us­\ning put/get operations on pointers. 2 RMA operations using \nlow-latency pinning of pages as shown in Figure 4. The low­\noverhead Put/Get operations used with RMA are based on \na single-instruction dispatch of work requests [IS] and are \nhelpful to minimize communication overhead for fine-grained \nmessaging applications, thus maximizing overlap between \ncomputation and communication. 3 used to support MPI over the EXTOLL network. This work \nmakes use of the RMA unit to implement a GAS-supported naccelerator clusters, but SMFU or VELO could also be used \nto perform low-latency put/get operations across the GAS. \nDue to the API-based nature of one-sided transfers using \nthe EXTOLL RMA unit as well as the availability of the \nInfiniBand Verbs API for data transfer we refer to our model \nas a "managed" globaJ address space, since memory regions \nare indirectly accessed. This indirect access is mostly due to \nthe limitations of current hardware and software stacks, but \nthe aggregation of multiple, non-coherent regions across the \n?<?.d? ! ____________________________ _ Node N ? ----------\nI \n'Response \n: Control \nI Path \nI endS/ete I \n--------- ?---? -- ---?---" ' " ' , , \nI : ?? i-- --'--_+_{ I Path \nFig. 5. OncilJa Runtime and use of API \ncluster and the use of put/get operations both provides similar \nfunctionality to traditional global address spaces. \nIV. ONCILLA RUNTIME AND API \nThe Oncilla runtime is designed to abstract away the com­\nplexity of remote memory allocation and data movement while \nalso providing optimized data transfer between remote and \nlocal host memory and 110 memory \(on GPUs a control path and a separate \ndata path. The control path performs the request, allocation, \nand freeing of local and remote memory and is accessed by an \napplication through the "OnciliaMem" library. In this example na local allocation is serviced easily through standard memory \nallocation techniques \(malloc, or new remote allocation \ninitiates the allocation of pinned DRAM pages on the remote \nnode. Once the allocation takes place, the runtime keeps track \nof the state of the aJiocation and also any processes needed \non each node to set up and tear down memory buffers. This \ninformation is made available to the application via the library, \nand subsequent "oncilla copy" \(aka, oemJopy network layer. \nThe data path could consist of any high-performance net­\nwork, but this work focuses on the EXTOLL RMA network \ninterface due to its low memory registration costs, high \nbandwidth, and low latency for small messages. InfiniBand \nRDMA is a similar high-performance networking fabric that \nis evaluated alongside EXTOLL in Section VI-A. Regardless \nof the selected fabric, once the setup phase is complete, the \napplication relies solely on the library and network layer to \ntransfer data from a remote memory to local host memory \nor 


local GPU global memory. This abstraction exposes a \nlarge memory to the application developer without having to \noptimize for the specific network underneath. \nThis idea of abstraction is further defined by the On cilIa API \nwhich has the concept of "opaque" and "transparent" operators \nthat support either naive or explicit hints about remote memory \nallocation and data placement. These library interfaces allow \na developer to specify whether just a large chunk of memory \nis needed or whether a chunk of memory on a specific device \non a certain node is needed. For example, a naive allocation \nmight specify that 20 GB of host memory is needed but not \nthe location of this memory. \noncilla_alloc\(20 GR, DRAM GB of DRAM to \nbe allocated on the local node, across two nodes, or across four \nnodes. The developer in this case accepts the access penalty \nfor remote DRAM rather than using disk-based operations. \nAlternatively, a developer could specify allocation in a fashion \nthat is closer to traditional NUMA commands noncilla_alloc\(20 GR, nodel_ddr, node2_ddr, equaCalloc to \nGPU memory, and the Oncilla runtime helps to allocate and \nkeep track of more advanced allocation and data movement \noperations. While scheduling of computation and fair memory \nallocation decisions can also be incorporated into the runtime, \nthis work does not currently attempt to solve this problem. \nFuture work includes evaluating the Oncilla resource man­\nagement framework alongside existing scheduling frameworks nsuch as those found in [20] and [21]. \nA. Using Oneilla for Existing Single-node Applications \nAs Section VI will show, Oncilla can be used to enable \nmulti-node resource allocation and data movement for existing nsingle-node applications. This work has demonstrated a few \nkey steps that are useful to consider when using Oncilla: \n• Plan data partitioning: The most important step for \nmodifying applications to work with remote memory is \nto consider how input data should be partitioned. The \napplications discussed in this paper depend on aggrega­\ntion of large amounts of remote memory and the use of \none accelerator, but the use of multiple accelerators could \ninform what segments of data should be placed on each \nnode. \n• Support non-coherent memory accesses \(or not supports non-coherent put/get \noperations or include additional software layers to pro­\nvide consistency between shared regions. TPC-H is an \napplication that performs few data updates, so it conforms \nwell to this standard. \n• Use managed allocations Oncilla's oem_alloe can cur­\nrently be used to replace GPU allocations local DRAM \nallocations and remote host memory allocations with \nEX TOLL or InfiniBand. Besides having simplified copy \nsemantics with the oemJopy API call, allocation with \nOncilla allows the master node to keep track of exist­\ning allocations for more informed resource management \nacross the cluster. An oem_loealbuf API call provides \na standard C pointer to the On cilIa allocated buffer, \nminimizing code modifications. \n Define the data transfer model For aggregated data \nworkloads like data warehousing, data transfer with nOncilla is performed using multiple oemJopy calls to \nstream inputs from remote host memory to local accel­\nerators. Other applications may require small reads and \nwrites that could affect data placement strategies and the \nplacement of data transfer calls. \nFig. 6. Relational Algebra Complex Benchmarks \nV EXPERIMENTAL SETUP \nTwo different two-node systems are used to evaluate the On­\ncilIa framework. Each blade in the EXTOLL cluster includes a \nsingle-socket AMD CPU, a solid-state drive \(SSD network interface, and a NVIDIA GTX \n480 GPU with 1.5 GB of GDDR. Each node in the InfiniBand \ncluster contains dual-socket Intel CPUs, a standard 5400 RPM \nhard drive, 12 GB of DRAM, an InfiniBand ConnectX-2 VPI nQDR adapter, and a GTX 670 GPU with 4 GB of GDDR. \nThe main application workload used to simulate large \ndata warehousing applications is based on relational algebra \nprimitives like those that compose the queries represented \nin the TPC-H benchmark suite [22] These queries are also \nrepresentative of the types of operations that Red Fox aims \nto support for GPU acceleration. These primitives, including \nproject, select and join, have been optimized for the GPU \nto perform efficiently when compared to CPU-only primitives \n[13 However, the performance of these GPU primitives is \nlimited by two factors: 1 nrequired for inputs, outputs, and temporary data and 2 bus. \nAs shown in Figure 6, the tests include two simple op­\nerations, select and join, and three more complex operations \nthat incorporate select, project, and join primitives. The more \ncomplex microbenchmarks also have two variations that can \ntake advantage of Kernel Fusion [14] to reduce the impact \nof the PCI Express data transfer costs and to reduce each \nkernel's GPU global memory footprint. These variations are \nrepresented as nonfused or fused \(not pictured microbenchmarks are \ntransferred to the GPU either directly from a hard drive using \nstandard C++ file operators \(fread the hardware setup, input files are limited to \n24 GB, and each node can allocate up to 12 GB of data to \nbe accessed from local memory, RDMA, or RMA. The IE \ncluster is limited to 11 GB, so inputs are pulled from an 11 


nGB allocation, where 1 GB of input is reused. Data files are \nrepresented using binary format and are read sequentially from \ndisk or remote memory. \nAs a secondary application, the SHOC BFS benchmark [23] \nis used to represent a simple graph algorithm and to demon­\nstrate how OncilIa can be extended for HPC applications.

Two tests are conducted to \ndemonstrate the overhead of using OncilIa for remote memory \nallocation and data transfer - one where the input graph \nresides solely in local memory and one where the input graph nresides in remote memory. An ideal implementation of this \nbenchmark would use a multi-node, partitioned graph with \nOncilIa for data movement instead of software layers, such as \nMPI, but the standard for distributed graph implementations, \nGraph 500 [24], currently lacks suitable support for GPU­\nbased algorithms. For this reason, we focus on a simple \nevaluation of the performance aspects and programmability nof using the Oncilla model for this type of application. \nVI. RESULTS \nBefore evaluating the applications, we use the Oncilla \nframework to perform a characterization of the allocation and \ndeallocation characteristics of the EXTOLL and InfiniBand \nnetworks. These allocation and deallocation tests look at \ntiming statistics for the creation of symmetric local and remote \nbuffers, and they give insight into which fabric might be best nsuited for a certain type of allocation. \nA. Oncilla Control Path \nAs Figure 7 shows, the EXTOLL network excels at small \nallocations while the InfiniBand adapter provides quicker allo­\ncations of large memory regions. For the smallest allocation, \n64 B EX TOLL takes 250.75 fJs versus 1.35 ms in the IE case. \nHowever for a 4 GB allocation, EXTOLL takes 1.67 s while \nInfiniBand takes 40.54 ms. Since both adapters must register nor pin pages in the OS to provide non-coherent buffers for one­\nsided put/get operations, the difference in performance can be \n25 \n-EXTOLlPut \n20 -[BPut \n-EXTOLlGet ,/' 15 -[BGet \n/ 10 \n/ \n5 ? 0 \n"" ..

' ..... ....... \n"? \n... .. \n, \n0' .. \nSize \(8 nfound in the design and optimization of the respective kernel \ndrivers, including support for Linux features like huge pages. \nFor instance, the EXTOLL 4 GB allocation takes 94.89 ms to \nbe registered with the OS while the IB allocation completes \nthe registration process in 38.88 ms. However, for a 64 B \nallocation EXTOLL requires just 3.10 /-is as compared to 37.68 \n/-is for lB. These results indicate that EXTOLL is faster for nallocations smaller than 4-8 MB while IB is faster for larger \nallocations. \nFigure 8 shows timing for EXTOLL and IB allocate and \nfree operations as well as the overhead for making an Oncilla \nallocation for varying sizes of memory regions. EXTOLL takes \nfrom 242.66 /-is to 95.47 ms to allocate a local buffer and \nconnect to a remote allocation while InfiniBand takes between \n1.26 ms and 40.80 ms for the same memory region sizes nLikewise, teardown for EXTOLL takes between 59.12 /-is and \n73.28 ms to tear down a 64B or 4GB region while InfiniBand \ntakes between 30l.42 /-is and 42.15 ms. \nOn cilIa overhead for the allocation of remote memory nregions is consistently around l.18 ms for the two-node case \nwhile deallocation of memory regions takes from 1.45 to l.55 \nms. This overhead is due to the time taken for transmission \nof POSIX and TCP/IP messages that are sent between the \nOncilla daemons, so it is not affected by the one-sided setup \nand teardown that takes place for a server and client allocation. \nWhile this overhead is substantial for very small allocations, \nthe use of memory regions larger than 8 MB greatly amortizes \nthe Oncilla setup and teardown overhead. Local host and GPU \nallocations that use the Oncilla framework also incur a small \noverhead penalty, on the order of 1 ms, but this overhead \nallows for tracking of cluster-wide resource allocations by a \nmaster daemon that can then make informed decisions about \nallocation based on the available resources in the cluster. \nThe use of the Oncilla framework also allows for easy \ncomparison of hardware bandwidths for put and get operations, \nas shown in Figure 9. The EXTOLL network adapter is based \non an FPGA running at 156 MHz, so its realized bandwidth is \nlimited to 7-8 Gbps \(9-10 Gbps, theoretical realized bandwidth of \n20 Gbps \(32 Gbps, theoretical adapter, this diagram also illustrates \nits suitability for transmission of messages smaller than 8 KB, \nwhich is discussed in more detail in [17]. \n120 \n100 \n80 \nE 60 \n;:: \n40 \n20 \n120 \n100 \n80 \n? 60 \n;:: \n40 \n20 \nr nII. • .1 .1 I \nU I I IJ IJ ___ .... .

nallocation of resources and better support for a wide variety of \naccelerator and network resources, as opposed to optimizing \nfor one specific networking fabric. \nFinally, projects like RAMCloud [31] are focused on pro­\nviding large, in-core memory allocations using standardized \nprotocols. Currently, RAMCloud focuses only on host memory \nand does not incorporate accelerator resources. \nVIII. FURTHER OPTIMIZATIONS AND CLUSTER nSCALABILITY \nAlso important to the discussion of resource management \nis the use of Oncilla as a portability framework. The same \napplication code that is used to enable multi-node memory \naggregation on an IE-based cluster can then be moved to an \nEXTOLL-based cluster and run without any further modifica­\ntions. Similar to how open-source frameworks like OpenS tack \n[32] focus on running virtualized applications on a variety of nheterogeneous clusters, Oncilla provides a path for application \ndevelopers to design high-perfonnance applications that can \noperate on clusters with heterogeneous network architectures. \nOne example would be to use the Oncilla stack to choose, \nat run-time, the desired networking fabric on a per-allocation \nbasis dependent on application characteristics and on available \nnetworking fabrics. For instance, small allocations and put/get \noperations might work best with the EXTOLL RMA or VELO \nprotocols, while large, bandwidth intensive transfers might be \nmore suited for InfiniBand. \nTo this end, the Oncilla software stack must also be capable \nof optimizing data movement across host-to-host, host-to­\nGPU, and GPU-to-GPU data transfers as shown in Figure 13. \nFuture work with Oncilla will support CUDA 5 and related \ndevices, which can take advantage of the Peer-to-Peer API \nto transfer data directly from a NIC to the GPU and reduce \ninter-node overheads. \nExperimental results demonstrate that On cilIa provides a \nhigh-perfonnance abstraction for allocating memory on re­\nmote nodes and transferring it to accelerators, but many data \nwarehousing applications may scale to several terabytes of \ndata. While the test infrastructure is limited in its installed \nmemory, typical servers can be provisioned with between 256 \nand 512 GB of host memory. For clusters that are built around \na 3D torus interconnect, a node might have up to six nodes \none hop away and up to 30 nodes one to two hops away. \nThis translates to potentially having 3 - 15 TB of DRAM \nthat can be incorporated into the global address space and \nthat could contain many data warehousing applications in-core n[1]. Oncilla further improves the perfonnance and ease of use \nof these clusters through low-overhead a1locations and high­\nperformance data movement. \nIX. CONCLUSION \nThe Oncilla framework and associated managed GAS sys­\ntem model provide an important addition to existing research \ninto scheduling and data placement for emerging heteroge­\nneous clusters. Due to the growth of large data sets for Big \nData applications like data warehousing and the increasing \navailability of accelerator clouds, such as EC2, it is important \nto be able to manage both host and accelerator resources across \na variety of cluster infrastructures. This work focuses on two \nsuch networking infrastructures, EXTOLL and InfiniBand, and \nthe use of CUDA-based accelerators, but future heterogeneous \nclusters might include multiple networks and OpenCL, CUDA, \nor custom accelerators. In addition to future research into \nextending On cilia for use with the full Red Fox framework, \nfuture work will likely focus on the convergence of different \naccelerators in a single cluster as well as further research into \nhow to cooperatively manage the allocation of cluster-wide \nresources with scheduling for both standard and virtualized \napplications. \nX.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
