Abstract 
Attribute based signature ABS scheme is an important cryptographic primitive which provides a powerful way for user to control their privacy However the computational and storage cost of ABS is reasonable when the number of 
users involved in the system is huge In order to reduce the bandwidth needed to transmit attribute based signatures and the time needed to verify them we propose attribute based sequential aggregate signature ABSAS scheme The ABSAS scheme allows a set of players to sign the different messages compress into a short signature which can greatly decrease the store space In this paper we also formalize ABSAS scheme and prove the security of this scheme in the standard model The analysis shows that our ABSAS scheme has less signature length and need less verify computation than the traditional ABS which is more appropriate for the actual situation especially where bandwidth is a bottleneck

I I NTRODUCTION Cloud computing has drawn extensive attention recently from both academia and industry as a promising computing paradigm Data security is greatly concerned from users when they offten store sensitive information on cloud servers Attribute-based encryption\(ABE  is considered as a ne w public key primitive due to it can achieve both information security and ne-grained access control Compared with ABE scheme attribute based signatures\(ABS scheme pro vides a powerful way for user to control their privacy It also helps to provide ne-grained access control in anonymous 
Cryptography Attribute-based signature Sequential aggregate signature 
 
authentication systems The ABS scheme extends identitybased signature where the signer is associate with a set of attributes instead of a single identity string It provides a powerful way for users to control their privacy the user can choose the subset of their attributes is relevant for the speciìc scenario in signing a document For example the headmaster wants a professor at age 45 in the computer science department to sign the technical report In this scenario this technical report would be sign with access structure 
professor AND CS department AND age 45  Any user who has an attributes set that contain the all attribute above could issue the signature In some cases there are many users involve 
  
in a project Different users take charge of his owner part of the data In order to keep the integrity of project document different user should use his own attribute set to sign the part of data When the number of user involved in the project is huge it is difìcult for the data storage to manage such massive signature Also different user wants to sign a different document by using ABS and send to cloud center through wireless channel The cost of bandwidth needed to transmit to the cloud center and space needed to store in the cloud center is reasonable when the number of signing users is huge We want a scheme can reduce both the transmit cost and space cost in the cloud center A multi-signature scheme allows a set of players to sign 
the same message by generating a short signature which can be veriìed against the set of these players public keys Aggregate signature is a generalization of this notion which each player signs different message with their corresponding private key Reducing bandwidth and store space is especially crucial for low-energy devices such as RFID chips and sensors Such signature schemes could reduce the bandwidth needed to transmit signatures the space needed to store them and the time needed to verify them In this paper we propose a scheme called attribute based sequential aggregate signature\(ABSAS scheme in order to reduce the length of attribute based signature The ABSAS scheme allows a collections of signatures associate with at 
tributes to be able to compress these signature into on short signature This kind of signature have less signature length than the original one and it is more appropriate for the actual situation especially where bandwidth is a bottleneck 
In basic ABE scheme an important application of the Fuzzy Identity Based Encryption FIBE a user encrypts the plaintext with a subset of their attributes and the receiver succeeds decrypt the ciphertext with any set of attribute that has at least common attributes with the encrypt attribute set We call this scheme threshold attribute-based encryption  ABE for describe simplicity Yang et introduce a ne w crypto

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
