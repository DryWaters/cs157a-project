that require instantiating computing resources to serve customers need Despite the distinctions among the three commonly accepted service models i.e IaaS PaaS and SaaS any large scale cloud computing environment requires the instantiation of multiple VMs Virtual Machines in a coordinated manner For instance a company providing a cloud computing service e.g real time stock market data which is globally accessed by thousands or even millions of clients may need to scale to multiple VMs if a single VM is incapable of handling all requests These VMs may further need to be placed in geographically distributed data centers to allow clients to access close-by VMs based on their 
respective locations Accessing geographically closer VM has the beneìts of smaller response time higher network bandwidth hence better performance In practical deployments once a VM is placed and assigned users can be easily directed to the assigned VM via server redirection approaches such as DNS When multiple VMs need to be placed in different data centers there is an immediate question of which VMs are allocated in which data centers a problem we referred to as 
problem As the users i.e clients that access VMs for cloud services have different geographical locations placing VMs appropriately in data centers leads 
VM Placement 
to better performance experienced by the users Take the following example Assuming there are multiple data centers residing in major cities including Beijing and San Francisco and totally three VMs are needed to serve all users If two thirds of the users are located in San Francisco while the other one third of the users are located in Beijing then the best strategy of VM placement is to place 2 VMs in San Francisco and 1 in Beijing There is a further question of 
 that is for a particular user which VM should be assigned to the user 1  This question seems trivial 
VM Assignment 
as the straightforward way of VM Assignment is to simply assign the VM that is nearest i.e with shortest geographical distance to the user However as we will demonstrate in Section II such a straightforward solution often leads to sub-optimal VM Assignment and worse performance In this work we consider the above two problems of VM Placement and Assignment Speciìcally we consider a scenario where a xed set of users are served by multiple VMs We propose an efìcient and effective way of placing VMs in multiple available data centers and assigning VMs to the users To this end we rst consider two simple 
solutions that can be easily proposed Though an optimal solution is deemed being NP-hard we propose a solution that has close-to optimal performance while runs much faster Referred to as OCPA Opportunity Cost based VM Placement and Assignment the solution can achieve much better user performance i.e effective and the running time complexity is kept linear 1 In this work the two expressions of Users assigned to VMs and VMs assigned to users are used interchangeably

An alternative solution to the VM placement and assignment problem is to enable VM migration that is migrating running VMs across data centers to achieve better performance when current VM placement and assignment is suboptimal Such solutions have attracted intensive research and discussions recently However VM migration is associated with certain challenges including implementation complexities network cost service disruption and computing resource wastage Note that these VM migration solutions essentially work in an orthogonal dimension and it is straightforward to develop an integrated solution that combines both VM migration and VM placement/assignement Thus in this work we do not delve deeper into the discussions of comparing and integrating VM migration For the remainder of the paper we rst provide motivations for the problem in Section II We then present the detailed algorithm in Section III We perform performance evaluation and show the results in Section IV We also present related works in Section V And nally in Section VI we conclude the work and list our future activities II M OTIVATION We rst deìne the problem we study and then provide a cloud deployment scenario to motivate our design The problem context that we will study is as follows The assumption is that VM placement and assignment works in a particular cloud computing deployment Such a deployment scenario includes the following components as shown in Figure 1 i One or more data centers whose geographical locations are known ii One or more cloud users that comprise the xed user set and their geographical locations are known iii One or more VMs that are placed in the data centers and each of the VM has an upper bound of the number of users it can serve The following assumptions are also made to simplify the problem statement and solutions i All VMs are identical in the sense any VM can be placed in any data centers ii Data centers have enough capacity to place VMs iii Other than geographical locations data centers have identical relevant properties e.g price network bandwidth etc iv User experiences e.g response time available network bandwidth are dominated by the geographical distances v The distances between an user and a data center can be obtained e.g through Geo-IP With the above assumption and statement we now formally deìne the problem as follows The available data cent set is denoted by  user set by and VM set by  Each is associated with a capacity value  We also use to denote the distance between and  Note that though for easy description we use geographical distance as the performance metric it can be adapted to use network distance or any other meaningful metric The objective is to place the required in  such that the total or average is minimized Please note that the proposed solution can easily be adapted to accommodate scenarios where some of the assumptions do not hold For instance if some data centers have limited capacity in terms of number of VMs placed then these data centers can be removed from current considerations when capacities reach the limit We do not explicitly discuss these adaptations here due to page limit Also note that though we only consider the problem of VM placement and assignment other relevant problems/solutions such as VM migration can be easily integrated into a complete solution Consider a cloud deployment scenario where a global company would like to utilize a public IaaS providerês platform to deploy 2 VMs serving 4 users For ease of illustration we assume each VM can only serve up to 2 users The IaaS provider has 3 data centers located in different continents The locations of data centers and users are shown in Figure 1\(a The company is free to choose any data centers to place their VMs but apparently the nearer the user to the assigned VM the better performance Firstly letês consider two simple strategies to the VM placement and assignment In todayês practice these two strategies are widely employed by many cloud providers In Figure 1\(b we show the simplest strategy which randomly places VMs in data centers and also randomly assign VMs to users which is referred to as RPRA Random Placement Random Assignment At a glance we see that user experience is quite suboptimal due the fact that many VMs are not assigned to closer-by users Particularly if the users assigned to 1 and 2 were switched users would have better average performance So an improved strategy is to assign VM to nearest users subjecting to VMs capacity limit We refer to such a strategy as RPCA Random Placement Closest Assignment The result with this strategy is shown in Figure 1\(c We see that 2 are assigned to the two closest users of 3 and 4 As 2 reaches its capacity 1 and 2 are assigned to 1 As we show in Table I this strategy reduces the VM-User distance by about 20 Aiming to obtain even shorter VM-user distances we proposed a few design components that can help improve Strategy

a Locations of DCs and users b Random Place Random Assignment c Random Place Closest Assignment Figure 1 on the aforementioned two strategies These components can be combined into a single solution First the properties of users geographical distributions need to be considered when placing VMs We deìne a term of for data centers Speciìcally each user is associated to the nearest data center and a data center treats the assigned users as its  This design component places as many as VMs in data centers subject to the associated population We refer to this component as  The resulting assignment of this component is shown in Figure 2\(a Note that for this assignment if there are more users than a VM can handle the users with shortest distances to the particular data center are assigned to the VM We observe that this strategy results in another 12 reduction on VMUser distance than RPCA as shown in Table I Second we observe that the assignment shown in Figure 2\(a can be further improved by an assignment shown in Figure 2\(b The key observation leading to the new assignment is that assigning closest users to a VM may result in performance In other words simply assigning closest users to a VM may unnecessarily leave other users being punished harshly To understand this letês look at the assignments shown in Figure 2\(b Comparing to the assignment of Figure 2\(a we see that the assignments of 1 and 3 are switched Though 3 is assigned to 1 in Figure 2\(a  as 2 and 3 are nearest users to 1 in Figure 2\(b 3 is assigned to 2 instead The beneìt of such assignment change is that 1 now can have a much shorter distance to its VM i.e 1 in stead of 2 From the perspective of 1 the distance to 2isthe second largest distance to all VMs which is thus deìned as the opportunity cost of 2\(a The opportunity cost is a price Figure 2\(a actually has paid because 1 has exceeded its capacity after assigning 2 and 3 thus unable to take 1 Thus rather than assigning VMs to nearest users assigning VMs to users that have largest opportunity costs actually can help reduce the average VM-user distance Third we also notice that in order for the above two design components to work effectively the VM placement and VM assignment need to work in tandem as opposed to working independently in RPRA and RPCA The reason for this is that population-aware components works best when data centers populations are dynamically updated reîecting previous VM assignments For instance if the data center with largest population has placed and assigned a VM it may not be the data center with largest population anymore thus the next VM placement may need to start from another data center Motivated by the above observations we propose OCPA Opportunity Cost based Placement and Assignment OCPA consists of 3 major design components of Population-aware Coupled placement and assignment and Opportunity cost aware which are presented in Section III For the particular sample scenario applying all three components can achieve another substantial 25 reduction on VM-User distances over a single component of  as noted in Table I In the aforementioned VM placement and assignment problem in cloud computing deployment environment to this end we propose an effective and efìcient algorithm Referred to as OCPA the algorithm places VMs in data centers based on user population and assign VMs to users based on a novel metric of  Rather than always assigning VMs to the closest users OCPA assigns VMs to users that have larger opportunity cost For comparison in Section IV we not only evaluate the performance of OCPA but also consider other types of solutions III D ESIGN D ETAILS With the problem deìned in Section II we now describe the design of OCPA Compared to the straightforward strategies e.g RPRA and RPCA that randomly place VMs in

a\ware Placement b\A Figure 2 data centers OCPA has the following three major design principles i The VM placement is based on the perceived population of users with regard to data centers The perceived population of a data center is deìned as the set of users that have the particular data center being the nearest one A population-aware VM placement strategy determines the number of VMs placed in a data center based on the latterês perceived population In other words the more closer-by users the more VMs will be placed on the data center ii The VM placement is coupled with VM assignment Though separating VM placement and VM assignment simpliìes the strategy design as shown in Sections II and IV considering them in tandem brings certain beneìts iii The VM assignment strategy is uniquely based on the introduction of opportunity cost which denotes the distance to a userês second nearest data center In other words when assigning users to a VM by considering both the currently being assigned users and those left-over users OCPA can achieve even further beneìts OCPA runs in the following steps as shown in Figure 3 In lines 1-6 of block we deìne a few notations we use in describing the algorithm Particularly the major inputs are the sets of and  while the outputs are the set of with assigned users For ease of description every VM can handle a xed number of users Also each data center of maintains a state of user set Now we move on to the Algorithm block in Figure 3 to go through the detailed steps During the initial state all distance pairs of and are computed based on which the set is lled as described in Lines 1 and 2 In addition the opportunity cost of each users deìned as the distance between the user and the second nearest data center is computed as shown in Line 3 After that the algorithm consists of two parts The rst part runs when there are some data centers have more than unassigned users which indicates at least one VM can be placed and the VM can be assigned to users from the data centerês perceived population The second part runs when the unassigned users from a single data center can not ll a VM Thus two or more data centers need to combine their unassigned users to form a VM which is then placed in the data center with majority of the assigned users Now moving on to the rst part where a while loop Lines 4-10 will make sure all data centers that are able to place a full VM have the VMs placed starting from the biggest data center i.e with largest number of unassigned users In particular during the above process these placed VMs are also assigned to users based on their opportunity cost Speciìcally the assigned users are those with largest opportunity cost rather than those with smallest distances to the data center The idea behind this is simple if an user is not assigned to the nearest data center then the user will be assigned to a further-away data center the distance to which is at least the userês opportunity cost In the second part of the algorithm starting with the biggest data center i.e the one with biggest  VMs are placed and assigned one by one Each time a VM is placed it is always placed in the biggest data center The VM is assigned to all the unassigned users of the data center and also takes over some more unassigned users from other data centers to form a full VM The taking-over process is simply based on the distances This process loops until all users are assigned IV E VALUATION We conduct the evaluation with a at 2D area where the inputs of data centers and users are placed For repeatability and reality we x the locations of data centers while

a Two data centers b Four data centers Figure 4 randomizing the locations of the users Though such a setup is a rather simpliìed one we feel it is sufìcient to demonstrate the effectiveness of OCPA Speciìcally we rst consider a 1000 by 1000 map then evenly place a xed number of data centers For instance if 4 data centers are placed then their coordinates are 250 250 750 250 250 750 and 750.750 The set of users are uniformly placed in the 2D area We consider all the 3 strategies described in Section II RPRA RPCA and OCPA For simplicity we assume each data center can hold as many as VMs and the VMês capacity is xed We vary the following variables number of data centers number of users number of VMs The performance metric we choose is the average distance between a user and its assigned VM Since for all 4 strategies the data center set and user set are identical the number of VMs placed is also identical Thus the average user-VM distance is an appropriate indicator of performance to compare In the following we use and interchangeably with regard to an userês experience We rstly consider two scenarios with 2 and 4 data centers The number of users is xed at 20 while is 2 Thus totally 10 VMs need to be placed The results are shown in Figure 4\(a and b respectively We observe that RPRA causes the largest average User-VM distance and RPCA works much better than RPRA thanks to the assignment of VMs to closest users OCPA results in the smallest average User-VM distance For the two scenarios OCPA beats RPRA on the User-VM distance by 68 and 66 respectively Interested in more closely examining the speciìc performance of each user we plot the user-VM distance for all the 20 users in Figure 5 For all users RPCAês performance is not worse than RPRA This is because RPCA improves on the basis of RPRA by assigning a possibly closer VM to a user As far as VM-user distance concerned we observe  with RPRA being the worst and OCPA the best We further study the impact of data center set size on performance Intuitively with more data centers evenly distributed in the area the performance should be better as VMs can potentially be placed in a data center that is closer to each user We x the number of users to be 1000 and number of VMs 20 We then increase the number of data centers from 2 to 12 We measure the average performance for each of the four considered strategies The results are shown in Figure 6 We observe that with more data centers RPRAês performance actually becomes worse This is due to the fact that a random assignment of VMs causes inîated user-VM distance For other 2 strategies the performance becomes better with more data centers For all scenarios OCPA outperforms other strategies In particular with 12 data centers OCPAês distance is 50 shorter than RPCA or a 2X improvement Comparing to RPRA the de-facto practice by most cloud providers today OCPAês distance is 82 shorter or a 5X improvement V R ELATED W ORK VM migration which re-allocates VMs across data centers or physical machines has served as an alternative solution to accommodate sub-optimal placements of VMs Major OS and platforms including VMware and Solaris typically provide such options e.g VMotion and LDom In 4 se v eral design options for migrating OSes running services with liveness constraints are considered and a solution of migrating VMs on top of the Xen VNM is proposed and evaluated Similarly works 6 study v ar ious aspects of VM designs Many works 8 measures performance of certain VM migration strategies The problem of VM placement on physical machines has been studied in works  Most studies consider the different characteristics of physical machines rather than data centers The goal of optimizing VM placement thus is to save energy or computing powers Our work focuses on the VM placement across multiple data centers while the goal is to improve the VM users performance

Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earthís orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraftís orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the missionís product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
