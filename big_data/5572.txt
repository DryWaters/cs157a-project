ICCCCT10 806 Analysis of  Test Case Coverage Using Data Mining Technique   C.P.Indumathi Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science and Engineering Anna University of Technology,Tiruchirappalli India, inducp@gmail.com B.Galeebathullah Lecturer,Department of CSE Sona College of Technology Salem,India kalifathullah@gmail.com   O.Pandithurai PG Scholor,Department of CSE Anna University of Technology Tiruchirappalli         Abstract Coverage analysis defines the tracing of a program by test cases. It also helps in the testing process by finding the areas of a program not exercised by a set of test cases. Introducing new test cases to increase coverage, and determine the quantitative measure of the code, which is an indirect measure of quality Coverage analysis provides more benefit when applied to an application that makes a lot of decisions rather than data-centric applications, such as a database application. This paper will discuss the issues that make test case coverage analysis a complicated task and how those issues are being addressed. We will describe the  technique for improving the maximum coverage 


for test case of a program  by using a data mining technique called Association rule Mining  Keywords:  Software testing,coverage,test case,test suite Association-rule  1  INTRODUCTION Software testing is the process of executing a program or system with the intent of finding errors. As a part of any software development process, software testing represents an opportunity to deliver quality software and to substantially reduce development cost as much as 50% [1 As software testing is an expensive software development activity,the cost of testing to achieve certain adequency according to given criterion is also importance comparison of testing costs involves many factors ,one of the simplified measure of test cost is the size of an adequacy criterion Generally softwares are tested through a test case. A test case has components that describes an input ,event or action and an expected response A test case is usually a single step, or occasionally a sequence of steps, to test the correct behaviour/functionalities. A test suite is a collection of test cases that are intended to be used to test a software program to show that it has some specified set of behaviours. A test suite often contains detailed instructions or goals for each collection of test cases and information on the system configuration to be used during testing. A group of test cases may also contain prerequisite states or steps, and descriptions of the tests. As one test case can hardly satisfy all the requirements, it is usually required to use a suite of test cases to satisfy as many as possible requirements Intuitively, the more test cases are used, the more possible the requirements are satisfied. Practically, a test suite usually undergoes a process of expansion, as new test cases are inserted into the test suite to ensure the requirements being satisfied. As a result, a test suite may contain more than enough test cases for satisfying the requirements.In this paper we propose a technique for maximizing coverage of a test case using a Association rule mining from Data Mining.A set T consists of test cases t1,t2,t3,t4tm} which satisfy the requirements R set of requirements {r1.r2.r3.r4.rm} by desired testing coverage

The symbol x means satisfaction of a requirement by a test case. Here we find out which test case achives the maximum coverage.so that we can optimize the problem of repeated test case.[8    978-1-4244-7770-8/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE ICCCCT10 807 2. DATA MINING  Data mining sits at the interface between statistics computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning database management and data visualization. It is the process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately comprehensible knowledge from data that is used to help by crucial decision-making. The search for an optimal solutionin the test case generation problem has a great computational cost and for this reason these techniques try to obtain near optimal solutions. As a consequence, they have attracted growing interest from 


many researchers in recent years. So, we are trying to apply mining techniques  3.COVERAGE ANALYSIS Coverage analysis is the process of Finding areas of a program not exercised by a set of test cases Creating additional test cases to increase coverage and Determining a quantitative measure of code coverage, which is an indirect measure of quality An optional aspect of  coverage analysis is Identifying redundant test cases that do not increase coverage Coverage analysis is sometimes called test coverage analysis. The two terms are synonymous. The academic world more often uses the term "test coverage" while practitioners more often use "code coverage". Likewise, a coverage analyzer is sometimes called a coverage monitor  4.ASSOCIATION  RULE AND MAXIMUM TEST CASE COVERAGE Association rule mining finds interesting association or correlation relationships.The association rules are considered interesting if they satisfy both a minimum support threshold and a minimum confidence threshold among a large set of data items[3][4][2][6].The input to the Association rule is a set of transcation id and items set . In the test case maximum coverage problem the item id considered  as requirements.and item as test cases . We taken support count as 2 for the above problem. We taken support count as 2 for the above problem. Fig 1 shows that the architecture of a system.The test suite is given input to the Association rule  mining module. the association mining module finds strong relation/Correlation between the test cases and requirements.the output delivers a maximum coverage test cases

All the studied test suite reduction techniques are implemented on this PC by a single software engineer using C Languauage and all the executables run on Windows Vista Home Professional .Heuristic Greedy  and heuristic  Random  are simply implemented as C programs  5.2 Subject Programs and test cases  In our Experiment we tested 3 small C Programs these programs results  are shown in the table 2.We considered statement coverage as the primary requirement .To obtain the statement coverage adequate test suites for each program,we tested the triangle program for study .This program basically accepts three positive integer value as input.from users and determines whether it is a valid triangle or not.Finally on the basis of this input it displays corresponding messages as follows A triangle having  three sides are equal Equilateral Triangle A triangle of  any two sides are equal Isosceles Triangle A triangle having three sides of different lengths Scalene triangle  


totally fourteen test cases are developed using whitebox technique for validation purpose, from these experiemts t2,t3,t5} achieves a maximum coverage of test cases.similarly for other program also  4.3 Experiemental Procedure  In our experiment we use a coverage criterion as statement coverage .As there are usually some none executable statements in a program and some executable statements may not be covered by any used test cases, the number of requirements for each program is typically smaller than its number of lines of code  4.4. Subject Programs and test suite  Name of the Program Lines of code No of test cases No of require ments Maximum coverage of test cases Quadratic Equation 15 8 5 t1,t2,t4 Biggest Numbers 12 15 7 t1,t5,t7 Triangle Program 16 14 7 t2,t3,t5 


  Table 2.Results of maximum coverage of test cases  4.6. Experimental Results  From the experiment shows that the algorithm  proves maximum coverage of test cases based upon the requirements  5.CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  On the basis of analyzing the maximum coverage of test cases,we applied the Association rules for finding correlation/Strong realtion between test cases and requirements,coverage criteria is the requirements used here.The Association Mining can gives better result for the maximum coverage of the test cases. In order to determine the coverage we gave the support count as manually.From the above experiment we can conclude that the association rule mining approach will shows the optimize  with smaller test case itself.We would like to runs similar experiments on programs from a broader  range of programming languages,sizes and problem domains ,in order to capture how large programs can quickly lead to maximum coverage. Coverage analysis makes the test cycle more efficient       ICCCCT10 809 REFERENCES  1]  Boris Beizer,Software Testing Technique, Second Edition International Thomson Computer 1990 ISBN 1-85032-880-3  2] Cornelia Gy?rdi, Robert Gy?rdi, prof. dr. ing.

Table V gives the set of intervals in which the variations are not significant.

In order to notice the differences, all grayed cells are pruned thanks to the RSA education wage [6;7] [8;9] [10;13] [14;18 2.85; 4.70] 3 4 15 -22 4.75; 7.14] 1 3 8 -12 7.30; 12.67] -2 -3 1 5 13.00; 26.29] -1 -4 -25 30 TABLE VII ENHANCED CONTINGENCY TABLE OF VARIATIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATION \(EDUCATION-WAGE This table is the starting point of the consolidation process described below 39 


V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables 


where knowledge is synthetically summarized. The formed attractive and repulsive zones, based on human considerations and statistics, guarantee that potentially interesting knowledge will be discovered with decreasing by the way the search space REFERENCES 1] J.
