The results show that finding a closed itemset is a process of establishing a Galois contact and mining all the closed itemsets is the way  to find out all the fixed points of its closed Galois operator Keywords- Data mining; Association rule; Complete lattice Fixed point I.  INTRODUCTION In recent years, with the rapid development of information science and technology, people accumulate more and more data, but often fall into the situation of "wealth of data and poor in knowledge. It becomes increasingly important to use the sharp increasing data with a lot of important unvoiced information. Data mining technology emerged [1-2], whose aim is to identify potential rules and to extract useful knowledge from the data. At present, data mining has become a very active frontier area in computer science and has a successful application in market analysis financial investment, health, environmental protection product manufacturing and scientific research and made a very significant social and economic benefit The problem of mining association rules in data is an important research direction. Association rules, as an important branch of data mining, describe the data in the database items \(attributes, variables relationship. The association rule mining has become a key 


technology and been studied by many researchers. Currently there are many algorithms for mining association rules Agrawal et al. [3] first studied the customer transaction database and the relationship between sets of items from large databases. They proposed to mine association rules in databases. Association rules in databases have since been a research focus. Researchers in this field have made important contributions to the mining of association rules in databases and they proposed many meaningful data mining algorithms such as Apriori algorithm, AprioriTid algorithm, Apriori Hybrid algorithms, which are mainly carried out by repeatedly scanning the database, iterating until the entire set of data items to generate frequent itemsets, and thus this is the current focus of the research on association rule mining algorithms [4]. Although in theory the concept of lattice and the use of Boolean algebra are studied [5], in general, the theoretical basis of this line of research is relatively weak Based on lattice theory in the framework of fixed point theory, we analyzed some problems of the association rule in data mining and obtained some interesting results II. THE CONCEPT OF LATTICE THEORY Definition 1   Suppose all subsets of a set can be seen as composed by a set called the power set, denoted by 2A Definition 2   Suppose  a  set  A, ? A ,?? is a partially ordered set, if any two elements of which are supremum and infimum, then ? A ,?? \(referred to as  A lattice, the elements yx ?  and x  y as x and y respectively, are intersection and union Definition 3   Suppose ? A ,?? is a lattice, if any nonempty set S, there are both supremum and infimum, we say that? A ,??is a complete lattice In the ordinary set theory, the so-called a relation from A to B, defined as a subset R, BAR ? , denoted by BA R??? . For convenience, we have the following definitions Definition 4   Suppose A ,B are sets RBA  a triple and, BAR ? , Ax?  and By? ,accordingly, are called objects and attributes, usually denoted by xRy , that means "the object x has attribute y Definition 5   An itemset X is a closed itemset, if there is not an itemset Y satisfying: Y is a true superset of X and anything which contains X contains Y 


The support for an itemset can be determined by that only corresponding to a closed itemset, so that the closed itemset retains all information of the support in the database. In this sense, the set of all closed itemsets can be regarded as a clustering of the set of all itemsets Definition 6   An itemset is frequent if its support is not less than a given minimum support threshold Definition 7   Suppose A is a set. c the function defined between the power set of A, c : AA 22 ? , is called a closed operator, if the following properties hold 1  2   2010 International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences 978-0-7695-4270-6/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/ICCIS.2010.327 1322 3   Definition 8  Suppose R is a binary relation between A and B, if AX ? , BY ? , so XxandByyX ???=? ,, xRy YyandAxxY ???=+ ,, xRy Claimed that ?X  is the pole of X , +Y  is the pole of Y Definition 9   Suppose A and B are two partial-ordering set X  is the pole of X , Y +  is the pole of Y Mapping  they satisfy 1  1 2x x? ?? 1 2x x A 2 1 2,y y B 3   Obviously, ? ?? and ? ??  are closed operators, also known as Galois closed operator. The following theorem is equivalent to the condition in Definition 9 Theorem 1 [6] Suppose A and B are two partial-ordering set, then the mapping ? : A B A B when ? x A?  and ? y B? , then *y x x y III. FIXED POINTS AND ASSOCIATION RULES Mathematicians have proposed a number of fixed point theorems, there are three types being widely used 


thinking along the Brouwer-Kakutani fixed point theorem proved;  along the Hahn-Banach contraction mapping principle to prove the fixed point theorem, the idea of the advantage is that it not only proves the existence of fixed points, but also constructs the specific algorithm for the fixed point;  the idea that along the Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem for the series, the series of fixed point theorem can have access to the specific algorithm for fixed point, but also with the help of the universal properties of  Lattice, to be more widely used, especially in the field of logic. Because knowledge" can be expressed as "lattice", the basic calculus of logic can be expressed as "lattice If the ID set U in the transactional database and itemset I are taken as A and B in a relationship the binary relation between ID set and itemset as a relation R. So Relation. If to establish its Galois contact according to Definition 9, the mapping ? \(I things of its itemset , is an ID set, and ??? : 2 2I I?  and 2 2U U? are closed operator, that is, Galois closed operator. In fact, searching a closed itemset is a process of establishing Galois contact process Theorem 2   Suppose there is an itemset I, and ???  is the Galois closed operator, then the set{ }2 in transaction database Proof: Suppose there is an itemset X satisfying X definition of the closed itemset, there is an itemset Y which is a truth superset meeting with each affair containing X contains Y, this is  definition of the closed operator, ??? \(Y X Y the truth superset of  X . Now that X is a closed itemset On the contrary, the assumption that a closed itemset X is in transaction database. Because ???  is a closed operator so ??? \( X X to the definition of the ? and ? , that each affair containing X contains ??? \( X a closed itemset, so ??? \( X Definition 10   P and Q are two partial-ordering sets P?Q  is a mapping,  if a ?b , ? \(a b 


the mapping with order preserving Definition 11   Suppose P is a partial-ordering set P ?Q  is a mapping, a  P ,if ? \( a fixed point of By the Definition 11, we know that each itemset in mapping ? ?? . Therefore, to mine all the closed itemsets is equivalent to finding all the fixed points of the mapping According to the relation of inclusion in set theory, the set of all itemsets complete partially ordered set, and mapping s t  X IP , so X = ? ?? \( X a mapping with order preserving, its fixed point exists How to find a fixed point mapping is often very difficult However, all itemitems 2I  in the transactional database is a complete lattice, the closed operator ???  is a mapping with order preserving, and the following fixed point theorem could give a concrete fixed point of the mapping Theorem 3[7] \(Knaster and Tarski lattice, ? : P?P  is mapping with order preserving, then  Definition 12 P and Q are two lattices, when the mapping ? :P?Q  meets    Claimed that mapping ?  is a union of homomorphism similarly, when a mapping ?  satisfies    Claimed that mapping ?  is an intersection of homomorphism. If the mapping ?  is both a union of 1323 homomorphism and an intersection of homomorphism, it is said to be lattice homomorphism. If P =Q , we claim that the mapping ?  is automomorphic Theorem 4 [6]   P is a complete lattice, ? : P?P ,if and only if  ? is automomorphic with order preserving there is at least one fixed point In fact, as for a special mapping ? ?? on an itemset, all of the fixed points can be found with the existing algorithm 7] for mining closed itemsets IV. ONE EXAMPLE 


There is a transactional database in Table 1. Each ID corresponds to each item, so the itemset A ABD BC  is a closed itemset. The support for an itemset can be determined by that only corresponds to a closed itemset, so that the closed itemset retains all information of the support in the transactional database. In this sense, the set of all closed itemsets can be regarded as a clustering of the set of all itemsets. All of the frequent closed itemsets in Table 1 can be given in all of the frames of dotted line in Figure 1 TABLE I.  THE TRANSACTIONAL DATABASE \(MIN-SUPPORT IS 60 TID Item 1 A 2 ABD 3 ABCD 4 BC 5 ABCD   ABC ABD ACD BCD ABCD AB AC AD BC BD CD A B C D  Figure 1.  Lattics of Itemset The lattice of fixed point constructed by all fixed point set about mapping ???  are showed in Figure 2 ABC ABD BC A B  Figure 2.  Lattice of Fixed Point V. CONCLUSION The association rule is a relation which is constituted by the ID set in the transaction database and itemset and their binary relation, then with the relation the Galois contact can be established, and associated Galois closed operator be given. The closed itemset is a fixed point of the Galois closed operator in the association rule. All fixed point set construct a complete lattice according to the relation of inclusion in set theory, --the fixed point lattice. Existing closed itemset mining algorithm is to find fixed point 


method. As the closed itemsets retained the support information of all itemsets, the fixed point lattice retained the support information of all itemsets in the transaction database. To mine all frequent closed itemsets is equivalent to finding the node set with support constraint on the fixed point lattice. Some classic fixed point theorems on lattice theory confirm the existence of fixed points, and then can get a theoretical method searching for closed itemsets in transaction database; it is a theoretical method searching for the association rule  ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by the 085 project of Shanghai Education Commission \(No. Z08509008-02 REFERENCES 1] R.

Accuracy for K-mean clustering and rule-based classification In Fig. 2, we show accuracy values of each application78 after clustering and rule-based classification. The number of cluster \(k a particular application. This is because, the number of flows in each clusters decrease and mean square error reduces for each iteration. This causes flow data to be tightly clustered With mean square error diminishing, misclassified flows are eliminated from the application class. We can observe an increase in precision for all the application classes. However with the increase of the number of clusters the processing time also increases. After several runs, we noted diminishing returns when the number of clusters was greater than 300. In order to get the optimum accuracy, we have averaged it for all values of k between 300 and 500 However, there is a need to estimate the number of clusters k for each clustering run. As we know same application class observes different behavior, therefore the value of k cannot simply be equal to the number of application classes. Hence it is difficult to estimate the k value for each new dataset as well as to maintain high accuracy and precision. One of the reasons is that K-mean clusters are partitioned by mean values iteratively. The mean values of random selected centers converge to the appropriate cluster. Finally, we observe that the overall accuracy is poor with a combination of K-mean 


with transductive and rule-based classification. Hence, we have used Model-based clustering that as will be shown, solves both issues Fig. 3. Bayesian Information Criterion distribution From Fig.3, we observe that Mclust uses BIC to estimate models and number of clusters. Model-based clustering estimates the cluster contour. For Mclust, geometric features are determined by covariances ?k. Each covariance matrix is parameterized by eigenvalue decomposition in the form [6 k = ?kdkAkD T k where, Dk = orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors, Ak = diagonal matrix whose elements are proportional to the eigenvalues of k, ?k = scalar quantity In the model, orientation for ?k depends on Dk. Also, the shape of the density contours is determined by Ak. The volume of the corresponding ellipsoid is proportional to ?dk | Ak where d represents data dimension. The characteristics of the geometric features of the cluster ? orientation, volume and shape are estimated from the data. These can vary between clusters, or be equal for all clusters. Hence we are able to estimate cluster contour for achieving precise model-based hierarchical clustering In one dimension dataset, equal variance and varying variance is represented by E and V respectively. For multiple dimensions, geometric characteristics of the model such as volume, shape and orientation is taken into consideration The volume, shape and orientation represents clustering of flow data. In our case, VEV model represents volumes of all clusters as varying \(V E V an approximation to the Bayes factor. It adds a penalty term to the log-likelihood estimation depending on the number of parameters BIC\(k x|?, k k n where, k is the number of clusters, p is the conditional probability; pi stands for different variance-covariance structures and v\(k clusters and covariance structure ?; ? represents maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters in the model \(k and n is the number of observations. BIC for each model is 


evaluated, and model with the highest BIC is the best model for the flow dataset As shown in Fig. 3, the best estimated model is VEV. VEV indicates volume and orientation is variable \(V equal \(E in Fig.3 that BIC is strongest for VEV model for number of clusters equal to 9. The number of clusters is very close to the number of applications, as opposed to K-mean technique Note that to get the highest accuracy from K-mean, more than 300 clusters were required In Fig.4, it is clearly shown that the model based clustering has performed better than K-mean classification for both data sets. Model-based clustering produces strong application clusters in the data. The Apriori based association rule classifier finds stronger association between flow parameters. The rules with high lift and confidence value, represent stronger correlation to the application. Hence, the rule set help us derive behavior pattern for a particular application class. We trace back the flows to the main trace file and we observe a strong probability that those flows belong to a particular application class. The overall accuracy of this method is around 94%, thus much higher than K-mean clustering method. We tested our model for CRAWDAD data and achieved similar accuracy of 93%.79   http mail snmp dns irc 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 ModelbasedandRulebasedClassificationAccuracyGraph WAND Crawdad Application A 


cc ur ac y   Fig. 4. Accuracy for Model-based clustering and rule-based classification Fig. 5. Distribution of flow attributes in scatter plot matrix In Fig.5, the distribution of IP and ports for source and destination is depicted for Model-based clustering method. For HTTP \(blue traffic to few destination IPs. HTTP behavior is prominent because a number of source hosts are communicating with small number of destination hosts, i.e., HTTP servers. In DNS application, source hosts communicate with a set of DNS servers. Each host interacts with different domains such as www, .org and .net for resolving IP addresses. The DNS behavior is prominent because large group of source hosts communicate with small repeated set of destination IPs. In the IRC application, a group of hosts communicates with other group of hosts. There is roughly one-to-one correspondence between source and destination IP. This behavior is prominent because IRC \(cross with approximately equal number of destination IPs. Moreover, source IP and destination port distribution show that destination port numbers are in the range of 30000 for SMTP green where as HTTP and MAIL have destination ports number in lower range of 1000. Model-based clustering with the Apriori algorithm provides reliable and accurate classification model as compared to K-mean method. The association rules helps us predict flows for particular application with high confidence and lift values IV. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have presented a classification model that achieves high flow classification accuracy with application behavior profiling. The use of the K-mean algorithm for Netflow classification was shown to be inefficient. On the other hand, Model based clustering with association rule mining techniques provided a much better accuracy. Moreover the rule heuristics are produced automatically, making the algorithm modular and independent of the dataset. In addition 


our model is able to detect new behavior patterns for next generation applications.

denote the input attribute with the minimum integrated cost after the split, and let the set of allocated sample sizes, computed by the sample allocation method explained later, be ASM . Then DM | children are generated for the node M . For each child CHi, i = 1, . . . , |DM |, the associated query is QN ?{M = mi sample size is asi ? ASM , and potential splitting attributes is PSN ? M . The process of splitting is then recursively applied to children of node N In the process of calculating costs during the strati?cation process, we need to perform sample allocation, i.e., divide the parent nodes sample size among the potential children nodes This is required for calculating the integrated cost for the potential split. This is based on our sample allocation method, which we 328 describe next in Section IV-B. Furthermore, for calculating the integrated cost, the variance of target value ?2i and probability of output attribute A = a, ?i, for each stratum is computed based on the pilot sample Initially, the strati?cation process on the query space begins by calling Stratification\(R, null, F IA, n, null root node. The process of strati?cation would stop if there is no leaf node with integrated cost larger than a prede?ned threshold Each leaf node in the tree is a ?nal stratum for sampling, and the associated sample size denotes the number of data records drawn from the subpopulation of the stratum B. An Optimized Sample Allocation Method Now, we introduce our optimized algorithm for sample allocation which integrates variance reduction and sampling cost As introduced in section IV-A, integrated cost is de?ned by taking into account of variance of estimation and sampling cost The goal of our sample allocation algorithm is to minimize the integrated cost by choosing the sample size, ni, for each stratum In our algorithm, we adjust the value of SampCost and ?2s so that their in?uences on the integrated cost are in the same unit SampCost SampCost SmpCost\(r where SmpCost\(r entire population, and ?r denotes the probability of A = a being true for the entire population 2 2s 


2r where ?2r 2 n denotes the variance of estimation of the target value on the entire population The key constraint on the values of the sample sizes for each strata is that their sum should be equal to the total sample size A vector n = {n1, n2, . . . , nH} is used to represent the sample sizes, where the ith element, ni, is the sample size for the ith stratum By including sampling cost and variance of estimation into the integrated cost, our sample size determination task leads to the following optimization problem Minimize Cost\(n  i\(?s ni i v N2i niN2 2 i subject to  i ni = n 6 where Ni denotes the population size of data records under the space of A = a in ith stratum. Note that this value may not be known if A is an output attribute. However, the total number of records in the ith stratum is typically known, and can be denoted as DNi. Then Ni can be estimated by ?iDNi, and the population size of A = a on the entire population is estimated by N  i ?i DNi For ?nding the minimum of integrated cost, we utilize Lagrange multipliers, a well know optimization method. Lagrange multipliers aims at ?nding the extrema of a function object to constraints. Using this approach, a new variable ? called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced and de?ned by n n  


 i ni ? n If n is a minimum solution for the original constrained problem then there exists a ? such that \(n Lagrange function. Stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of ?\(n n,??\(n 7 In our problem, by conducting partial derivatives on Formula 7 a group of equations are yielded as follows s i v N 2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? = 0 i = 1, ..H i ni = n 8 where the solution n leads to the minimum value of integrated cost in Formula 5 However, it is dif?cult to solve the group of equations directly Thus, we use numerical analysis to approximate the real solution. Newtons method is utilized for ?nding successively better approximations to the zeroes \(or roots Given an equation f\(x x tive of function f\(x method iteratively provides, xt+1, a better approximation of the root, based on xt, the previous approximation of root according to the following formula xt+1 = xt ? f\(xt f ?\(xt The iteration is repeated until a suf?ciently accurate value is reached, i.g. |f\(xt In our problem of Formula 8, there are H + 1 equations F \(xt xt xt n1, .., nH , ?}, where the equations in F \(xt fi\(xt s i v N 


2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? i = 1, .., H fH+1\(xt  i ni ? n The Newtons method is also applied iteratively via the system of linear equations JF \(xt xt+1 ? xt xt 9 where JF \(xt H + 1 H + 1 equation system F \(xt vector xt. The entry JF \(i, j d\(fi\(x dxj where fi\(x xt x From the Expression 9, a better approximation xt+1 is obtained based on previous approximation xt. The iterative procedure would be stopped if ?i|fi\(xt threshold, and then the sample size ni is allocated for each stratum so that the integrated cost is minimized. In reality, we are required to pick an integral number of records from each stratum during the sampling step. Thus, we round down each ni to its nearest integer, ni + 0.5 In the example shown in Table I, suppose we set both weights v and ?s to be 0.5. Further, assume the variance of the entire population, ?2r , to be 80000. The probability of A = a over the entire population ?r is 0.242. By using the proposed optimized sample allocation method, the sample sizes for the three strata 329 are 162, 299, and 139, respectively. In this case, the variance of estimation according to the Expression 2 is 93.66, and the estimated cost is 1943.7. We can see that, compared with Neyman allocation, the sampling cost is decreased by 42.1%, but results some increase in variance. Overall, this example shows that we can achieve lower sampling cost by trading off some accuracy C.

EVALUATION STUDY We evaluate our sampling methods for association mining and differential rule mining on the deep web using two datasets described below US Census data set: This is a 9-attribute real-life data set obtained from the 2008 US Census on the income of US households. This data set contains 40,000 data records with 7 categorical attributes about the race, age, and education level of the husband and wife of each household and 2 numerical attributes about the incomes of husband and wife 


Yahoo! data set: The Yahoo! data set, which consists of the data crawled from a subset of a real-world hidden database at http://autos.yahoo.com/. Particularly, we download the data on used cars located within 50 miles of a zipcode address. This yields 30,000 data records. The data consists of 7-attribute with 6 categorical attributes about the age, mileage, brand, etc, of the cars and one numerical attribute, which is the price of the car Variance of Estimation is estimated for the target value \(i.e mean value in differential rule mining, and con?dence in association rule mining is calculated according to the Expression 2. Since variance of estimation reveals the variation of the estimated value from the true value, smaller variance suggests better estimation Sampling Cost is estimated by the number of queries submitted to data sources in order to acquire a certain number of data records containing target output attributes, i.e. A = a. Larger sample size implies higher sampling costs in a deep web setting where the queries are executed over the internet Estimate accuracy is estimated by Absolute Error Rate \(AER Small AER value indicates higher accuracy. For an estimator on variable Y with true value y and estimated value y, the AER of the estimator is calculated by AER\(y A. Association Rule Mining In this section, we present the results of our method for association rule mining. Using our overall approach, we have created four different versions, which correspond to four different sets of weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling costs. 1 the weight ?v = 1.0 and ?s = 0.0, 2 the weight ?v = 0.7 and ?s = 0.3, 3 v = 0.5 and ?s = 0.5, and 4 weights ?v = 0.3 and ?s = 0.7. In addition, we also compare these approaches with a simple random sampling method, which is denoted by Random We focus on the queries in the form of A = a ? B = b where A and B are output categorical attributes. Other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes Our goal is to estimate Supp\(A=a,B=b A=a association rules are randomly selected from the datasets. Each of the 50 association rules are re-processed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations result is the average result for 5000 executions 


In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
