The Empirical Research on the Relationships between Individual Differences and Psychological Contracts Using Knowledge Employees as Research Participants  JIE LIN YIN Economics & Management Institution Beijing Information Science & Technology University Beijing, China yinjielin0924@sohu.com XIN WU Economics & Management Institution Beihang University Beijing, China wuxin@buaa.edu.cn  Abstract 227This research examines the relationships between individual differences \(equity sensitivity and careerism\ and psychological contracts \(transactional, balanced, and relational using knowledge employees as research participants. We test the 
hypothesized relationships using hierarchical regression analysis with data from a sample of 452 knowledge employees from several big cities of China. The results show that equity sensitivity is positively related to transactional psychological contract and negatively related to balanced psychological contract, and careerism is positively related to transactional psychological contract and balanced psychological contract, and negatively related to relational psychological contract Keywords- equity sensitivity careerism; transactional psychological contract; balanced psychological contract; relational psychological contract I  
 I NTRODUCTION  The employment relationship has undergone a number of significant changes in recent years. In large part, this transformation has been brought about by the increasing globalization of business, by the dramatic rise in the number of mergers, restructurings, and layoffs, and by the increasing rate of change that permeates all of organizational life today [1   Since the notion of psychological contract between employer and employee has gained currency as a means of understanding changes in the employment relationship p s y c ho l o gi c a l  contract ha become increasingly important in helping to define the contemporary employment relationship [3   
Psychological contracts consist of the beliefs employees hold regarding the terms and conditions of the exchange agreement between themselves and their organizations [4   Although psychological contracts were first discussed by organizational scholars in the 1960s, only recently have these unwritten work agreements attracted widespread attention Much of this attention has been generated by the perception  that the employment relationship is undergoing a period of dramatic change and that psychological contract violations are becoming more commonplace [5 R e cen t r e s e ar ch  on  psychological contract has generally focused on two areas First, a number of articles have discussed the changing nature 
contents and the types of the psychological contract. Second another line of research has investigated the antecedents and negative consequences of psychological contract breach \(or violation\ on employee attitudes and behaviors. There is little attention given to the antecedents of different types of psychological contracts except some scholars\222 scattered works 6-8  A s t o  th e res e a r ch  p a rt i c ip an ts th e r e is n o  res e a r ch e r to  focus on knowledge employees by far. In the era of knowledge economy, knowledge employees are the most important resources of organizations. Therefore, studying issues related to knowledge employees has great practical meaning. Our paper aims to contribute to the psychological contract literature in the 
following area: investigating the relationships between individual differences and psychological contracts using knowledge employees as research participants II  P SYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT THEORY  Psychological contracts are an individual\222s beliefs regarding reciprocal obligations in an employment exchange relationship [9 h e s e be l i e fs ar e b a s e d o n  a n i ndi vi d u al 222s  perceptions that promises have been exchange and accepted by both parties. The psychological contract is found to serve as an important regulator of employer-employee relationships [9 10  E m e r gi ng e m p i r i ca l re s e ar c h sugge st s t h at t h e t y p e o f  relationships that individuals perceive they have with their 
employer have important consequences for how the individuals contribute to those relationships [1   Beginning with Macneil, scholars have proposed typologies for conceptualizing the forms that psychological contracts can take. Macneil conceptualized psychological contract on a relational-transactional continuum [4 R o ussea u  pr opo sed t w o  key facets that would help distinguish forms of psychological contract: time frame and performance requirements. Time frame is in reference to the anticipated duration of employment short-term vs. long-term\while performance requirements involve the connection between the rewards employment provides and performance demands \(low vs. highly specified 
performance-reward contingencies\.

facets to develop four types of psychological contract transactional, relational, balanced and transitional. She operationalized the framework in Psychological Contract Inventory \(PCI  Transactional contract refers to short-term or limited duration employment arrangements, primarily focuses upon economic or monetary exchange. In contrast, relational contract  involves a mutually satisfying relationship with openended arrangements that include socioemotional as well as economic terms  based upon mutual trust and loyalty. The third type, balanced contract, consists of an open-ended relational emphasis with the transactional feature of well-specified performance-reward contingencies and it is sometimes referenced as a type of “hybrid” psychological contract [13  Balanced contract expresses employee’s identification with his/her profession [8  Des p it e  co in in g th e n o ti o n o f t r an si ti o n al  contract as a fourth type of psychological contract, Rousseau indicated transitional contract was not a psychological contract but more of a cognitive state, which could be viewed as a total breakdown of an agreement between the employee and his/her organization reflecting the consequences of organizational change [12   A cco r d in g l y   t r an s a cti o n a l  rel a ti on al  an d  balanced contracts represent important types of psychological contract in employment situations Studies have confirmed the types of psychological contract assessed in the PCI in the United States, Singapore [12  L a t i n  America [14 an d C h in a  1 5   A d d iti on ally L e e et al   1 6  examined whether transactional, relational, and balanced contract types were relevant in China by formulating their own measure with the help of representatives from Hong Kong and the United States although they did t use the PCI. The findings of Lee et al. indicate the three forms of psychological contract in both countries and are consistent with the notion that contract types have similar meanings across the two  Based on above empirical researches, our study intends to use PCI to operationalize the psychological contract III  S ELECTION OF INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ANTECEDENTS  From the definition and formation of psychological contracts, we can see that cognition plays a very critical role Lewis, Goodman and Fandt define cognition as “the way that people experience, process, and interpret things around them and further point out, “cognition is not completely accurate because it is influenced by many factors including individual’s experience, demand, personality and education level. Since each one has his/her special cognition, different people have different ideas when they meet the same condition or information [17 Hu se m a n  Hatf ield an d Mile s also th i n k  that individual differences can lead the people to have different cognition when facing the same things because they have different preferen ccording to th eir v i e w points   psychological contracts can be influenced by employee’s characteristics since individual characteristic affects people’s cognition and the cognition plays a critical role in the development of psychological contract. In this paper, we select two most representative individual-level variables of knowledge employees which are different from ordinary employees’ and investigate the relationships between these variables and psychological contract types After analyzing the characteristics and demands of knowledge employees, we select equity sensitivity and careerism as individual-level variables which differentiate knowledge employees from ordinary ones The concept of equity sensitivity was first presented by Huseman, Hatfield and Miles in 1987 which suggests that individuals react in consistent but individually different ways to both perceived equity and inequity because they have different preferences for equity [18  P e op l e  w h o  ha ve  hi gh  equity sensitivity are outcome-oriented. They attach high importance to outcomes and they want to get more when paying the same. Knowledge employees pay much more on money, time and energy than ordinary employees since they spend more time on education and their losses of materials and chances are much more than ordinary employees’. Therefore they hope to get high rewards quickly even if the values of their work are not so much. Besides, knowledge employees think they are superior to others and exaggerate their abilities generally for they own enormous intellectual resources. Based on the above reasons, equity sensitivities of knowledge employees should be higher than that of ordinary employees Careerism refers to the degree that employees view employment with current organization as a stepping stone to another on div i d u als h i gh er on careeris m are more  likely to perceive their current employer as an instrumental stepping stone up the career ladder A s  w e kn o w  that knowledge employees’ need levels are higher, they care the acquirements of self-worth more and they are eager to get internal satisfaction and achievement from their jobs compared with ordinary employees. Once the current jobs are not attractive enough or lack of development and promoting room, they are easy to leave the current organizations and look for new career chances. Accordingly, knowledge employees should be higher on careerism than ordinary employees IV  H YPOTHESIS  As discussed above, those high on equity sensitivity put great importance on outcomes. They desire to get more than others when paying the same. However, those low on equity sensitivity put more importance on their contributions in the exchange relationship and they are less sensitive to equity O’Neil and Mone found that equity sensitivity was negatively related to job satisfaction and organizational commitment positively related to intention to quit [19 Su azo in v e sti g at ed  the relationship between equity sensitivity and psychological contract breach and the results suggested that they were positively related [20 T h u s  w e ca n co n c l u d e th a t e m p l o y ees higher on equity sensitivity treat and evaluate what happens in the organization more negatively and they take on fewer responsibilities at work according to reciprocity principle Since balanced psychological contract and relational psychological contract represent the positive views that employees are willing to take on more responsibilities and 


transactional psychological contract represents the negative view that employees are just willing to take on limited responsibilities in the exchange relationship with organizations, we hypothesize that   Hypothesis 1a. Equity sensitivity is positively related to transactional psychological contract   Hypothesis 1b. Equity sensitivity is negatively related to balanced psychological contract   Hypothesis 1c. Equity sensitivity is negatively related to relational psychological contract From the concept of careerism, we can see that employees higher on careerism are more likely to view employment with current organization as a stepping stone. They have high expectations for their organizations since their needs for career development and individual promotion are very strong Therefore, they evaluate what their organizations give them more negatively when treated equally. Besides, in order to find good excuses, they will pay more attention to negative information of their organizations according to information processing theory and cognitive dissonance theory because they are likely to quit the current organizations at any moment when finding a better job Employees high on careerism are not willing to keep a long and stable relationship with current organizations. They have no affective attachments with their current jobs. The responsibilities to their organizations are not beyond what the written agreements prescribe. However, employees high on careerism have strong commitments to the careers they are engaged in since they especially care career development and individual promotion. This is consistent with what the balanced psychological contract embodies - the identification with the career. Accordingly, we give the following hypotheses   Hypothesis 2a. Careerism is positively related to transactional psychological contract   Hypothesis 2b. Careerism is positively related to balanced psychological contract   Hypothesis 2c. Careerism is negatively related to relational psychological contract The hypothesized relationships are showed in Figure 1        Figure 1  The hypothesized relationships V  M ETHOD  A  Participates In this paper, the following two factors are considered when operationalizing knowledge employees: \(1\asks employees assigned are finished mainly in the office and \(2 employees must gain bachelor or above degrees Data were collected through a questionnaire survey distributed to 600 employees of some high-technology companies according with above requirements from several cities of China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hefei. In order to ensure the authenticity of responses, the questionnaire takes the form of anonymity. Out of the 600 employees surveyed, 452 employees completed the survey, a response rate of 75 percent. The sample was 36.5 percent female, 64 percent were under 30 years of age, 3 percent were over 40, 98.5 percent were graduates and above, the average total tenure was 5.2 years \(SD 4.16\ and the average tenure of the current job was 3.81 years \(SD 3.46 B  Measures All measures used a 5-point Likert type scale response format \(1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree\. The reported psychological contract was measured with the revised Psychological Contract Inventory developed by Rousseau which represented the three psychological contract types of transactional and balanced, relational [1 24 i t e m s w e re included \(4 items for transactional contract, 10 items for balanced contract, and 8 items for relational contract\. Equity sensitivity was measured using a 5-item measure developed by Huseman, Hatfield and Miles [18 C a re eris m  w a s m eas u r ed  using 5-item measure developed by Rousseau [9 VI  R ESULTS  Before testing the hypotheses, we examined the internal consistencies of all scales and confirmed the existence of the three psychological contract types. The Cronbach Alpha obtained for transactional psychological contract, balanced psychological contract, relational psychological contract equity sensitivity and careerism was 0.65, 0.91, 0.84, 0.70 and 0.54 respectively. We found that the Cronbach’s of careerism was much lower than 0.70. It was quite bad. The reason may be that two items of careerism measure adopt reverse-scoring and Chinese are not accustomed to answering reverse-scoring items After deleting two reverse-scoring items, the Cronbach’s  became 0.70 which was in the acceptable range. Therefore, the careerism measure just kept 3 items in practice. Though the Cronbach’s of transactional psychological contract was lower than 0.70 slightly, it could be accepted Then we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS 16.0 to confirm the existence of the three psychological contract types. We used CMIN/DF, CFI, GFI and RMSEA as key indicators of overall model fit. Values of less than or equal to 5 on the CMIN/DF, greater than or equal to 0.90 on the GFI CFI, less than or equal to 0.08 on the RMSEA indicate good fit 21   T h e C F A y i el de d ac ce pt abl e f i t i n di c e s  C M I N  D F  2  48   CFI=0.94; GFI=0.90; RMSEA=0.057.

The control variables were entered in step 1 of the equation. These included gender, education level, age, total tenure, tenure of current job, and times of converting jobs. Here it was necessary to point out that two dummy variables were introduced to represent bachelor degree and master degree of education level respectively Hypotheses 1a and 2a were tested by regressing transactional psychological contract on the control variables equity sensitivity and careerism. Hypotheses 1b and 2b were tested by regressing balanced psychological contract on the control variables, equity sensitivity and careerism. Hypotheses 1c and 2c were tested by regressing relational psychological contract on the control variables, equity sensitivity and careerism. Whether hypotheses were confirmed was through observing regression coefficients of equity sensitivity and careerism separately As Table 2 shows, equity sensitivity was positively related to transactional psychological contract 0.342, P 0.01 negatively related to balanced psychological contract 0.205, P 0.01\nd not related to relational psychological contract 0.006\. From Table 2, we can also see that careerism was positively related to two psychological contract dimensions - transactional psychological contract 0.185, P 0.01\ and balanced psychological contract 0.095, P 0.05\nd negatively related to relational psychological contract  0.245, P 0.01\herefore, hypothesis 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 2c were all supported and hypothesis 1c was not confirmed TABLE II  REGRESSION  RESULTS  PREDICTING  THREE  TYPES  OF  PSYCHOLOGICAL  CONTRACT  Transactional psychological contract   Balanced psychological contract  Relational psychological contract  Step 1 Gender 0.007 0.069 0.048 0.047 0.025 0.042 Diploma 1 0.096 0.091 -0.022 0.052 -0.190 0.102 Diploma 2 0.061 0.064 -0.021 0.049 -0.215 -0.137 Age 0.055 0.008 -0.067 0.059 0.027 -0.004 Total tenure 0.063 0.075 -0.016 -0.026 0.030 0.012 Tenure of current job 0.091 0.017 0.002 0.039 0.036 0.072 Times of converting jobs 0.020 0.005 0.037 -0.033 -0.089 -0.103 R 2  0.018 0.007  0.021 Step 2 Equity sensitivity  0.342 0.205 0.006 Careerism 0.185**  0.095*  -0.245 R 2   0.204 0.112  0.115 p<.05   **<.01     


VII  D ISCUSSION  This study served t following purpose: studying the relationships between individual differences and psychological contracts using knowledge employees as research participants 5 of 6 hypotheses were confirmed The only unconfirmed hypothesis is that equity sensitivity is negatively related to relational psychological contract. The result showed that they were not related. The reasons can be explained below. As discussed above, relational psychological contracts are based upon mutual trust and loyalty and express employees’ positive affections for their organizations However, employees high on equity sensitivity have a preference to calculate what they get and give in employment relationships and care for them very much. That is to say equity sensitivity is rather a rational construct whose relationship with affection-related factors is not close. The score on equity sensitivity is unable to influence the affections that employees have for their organizations. Moreover, social desirability may weaken the relationship between equity sensitivity and relational psychological contract when employees answer the questionnaires Finally, it is important to point out the study’s limitations The biggest problem of this study is that data were collected at a single point in time. Thus, the use of cross-sectional research design limits the ability to make firm conclusions about cause and effect among variables in the study. Future longitudinal research is needed to confirm the conclusions drawn by this study R EFERENCE  1  G. D.

compared to TCP Reno for both 0.0 and 1.0e-04 bit error rates As such we argue that connection-less transport layer protocols like UDP should be used to transmit medical imagery over 2-meter amateur packet radio networks However the correctness or quality of the medical imagery seen by the receiver is now at issue and will be discussed in the next paper section 6 IMAGE QUALITY MEASURES Concerning the ns-2 simulations discussed in the prior paper section no actual medical imagery were transmitted Thus image quality was not measured While gray scale color or multi-spectral medical imagery are not corrupted during transmission using connection-oriented transport layer protocols such as TCP Reno image quality is a concern when using connection-less transport layer protocols like UDP because data are susceptible to corruption When data corruption occurs the transmitted image is 1 statistically not equivalent to the original image 2 perceived by a human to be distorted compared to the original image or 3 both 1 and 2 occur Several image quality measures IQM are discussed in literature 5 7 Two general IQM classifications are subjective and objective Subjective IQM SIQM are numerical values based on a user's perception of the transmitted image's correctness compared to the original The primary advantage associated with using SIQM is that since a human is the end user utilizing human perception is acceptable as a quality metric The two main disadvantages associated with using SIQM include 1 the time required to query a user's perception of image quality and 2 the fact that the assessment concerns only the quality of the transmitted image Objective IQM OIQM are numerical values representing the difference that exist between the pixels in the original image and those in the transmitted image The main advantage to using OIQM is that good results are generated when image distortion is due to additive noise The primary disadvantage to using OIQM is that it does not account for the user's observed perception of the transmitted image 7 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we discuss the ns-2 simulated transmission of 64 KB 512 KB 4 MB and 32 MB files sizes using TCP Reno and UDP when segment sizes and bit error rates are varied Our data show that smaller segment sizes minimize file transmission times when the bit error rate increases Based on our results we advocate using connection-less transport layer protocols when transmitting medical imagery over 2-meter amateur packet radio networks We also discuss measures to evaluate the quality of medical imagery transmitted using connection-less transport layer protocols such as UDP Since the ns-2 simulator only simulates the transmission of files across a logical topology image quality measures were not applied to the data discussed in this paper However image quality measures will be used during future planned live tests of medical imagery transmission over actual 2-meter packet radio networks While the research presented in this paper discusses the transmission of medical imagery over Earth-based 2-meter amateur packet radio networks our results can be extended to medical imagery transmitted over packet radio networks on other terrestrial surfaces within our Solar System Specifically Mars and the Earth's moon where communication satellites are currently absent and High Frequency radio data transmissions which are use for voice and data communication on Earth suffer due to a minimal atmosphere or the lack of an atmosphere respectively 16 8 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author graciously thanks the following individuals for their important contributions to this paper First thanks to Heather Nikki Simmons for her input concerning image quality measures Thanks also to Allison M.D Wiedemeier Ph.D for reading several drafts of this paper The author's research is supported through funds provided by the Clarke M Williams Jr Endowed Professorship in Computer Science and the Howard Hughes Undergraduate Biological Sciences Education Program both at The University of Louisiana at Monroe As stated above the ns-2 simulator only simulates the transmission of medical imagery using UDP Thus we are unable to apply IQM to the data presented in this paper However we intend to transmit medical imagery over the physical topology shown in Figure 1 in the near future At that time we will evaluate the quality of transmitted medical imagery using specific IQM which have yet to be identified 6

6.2 Results  Figure 2 shows the overall average results of the BIA maturity assessments of the Belgium and Dutch participants. From this graph, some differences are immediately clear, specifically for skills  governance and scope and architecture Figure 3 shows the results on a deeper level. Based upon these differences, the following analysis can be made  Communications maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.0 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.9 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants do not show a lot of difference, also on the level of the individual assessment items shown in Figure 3. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Value measurement maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 2.7 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.9 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants on this variable show some difference. On the more detailed level, a substantial difference is shown on the item Formal assessments reviews The direction of the difference, however, is opposite to the expectation. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Governance maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.8 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.4 On this variable of BIA maturity, the results show the expected difference that the Belgium participants score higher than the Dutch participants. On the more detailed level it becomes clear that especially the prioritization process is scored significantly different The expected difference is therefore confirmed  Partnership maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.2 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.2 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants on this variable are equal. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Scope & Architecture maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.3 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.8 For this variable the expectation was undecided. The results show a remarkably higher score of the Belgium participants than of the Dutch participants. On the more detailed level this difference shows on all items  Skills maturity Average maturity of Belgium participants: 2.8 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.2 For this variable, the results show the expected difference that the Dutch participants score a higher maturity than the Belgium participants. On the more detailed level it becomes clear that this difference shows on all items, but most strongly on Ability to attract and retain and Change readiness The expected difference is confirmed  Table 5 shows the summary of the results of this exploratory study    0,00 0,50 1,00 1,50 2,00 2,50 3,00 3,50 4,00 4,50 5,00 Und e rstand i ng of b u sines s by IT Und ers tand ing of I T b y bu si n e ss Inte r/I ntraorg aniz ati onal lea rn ing K now led ge S ha rin g I T Metr i cs Business Metric s Bal a nc ed M et ric s Formal Assessments/Revie ws Conti n uous Im proveme n Budgetar y Cont r o l IT inves tm ent m a nage m en P riorit iz ation pr oces s Busin e ss per c eption o f IT val ue S hared  goals r isk, re w ards p e nalt i e s Re lat ions hip trus t st yl e Sta nd a rds Ar t iculatio n Ar chit ectu ral inte grat io n D isr upti on from Ch ang es Inn o vation  Entre p reneu rs hip Loc us of Po w er Cha n ge rea d ines s Ab i lity to attract a n d reta i n Netherlands Belgium Communications maturity Value measurement maturity Governance maturity Partnership maturity Scope & Architecture maturity Skills maturity  Figure 3.

Conclusions and limitations  The conceptual analysis of the potential influence of national cultures on BIA maturity provides indications that this influence is indeed more than likely and that its influence is consistent over the different dimensions of culture. Our first empirical exploration provided support for the existence of differences in BIA maturity between countries. More specifically, the differences in scores regarding the alignment domains governance maturity and skills maturity could be explained by Hofstede s cultural differences studies, with governance maturity scoring higher in Belgium and skills maturity scoring better in the Netherlands. One a more detailed level, it was expected and confirmed that the portfolio management process received better in Belgium and that Ability to attract and retain and Change readiness clearly received better scores in the Netherlands Our study did not, however, confirm all expected results. The domains communications maturity  value measurement maturity and partnership maturity did not show the difference in scores that were expected. In fact, the scores showed no clear substantial at all. A potential explanation for this result could be the small sample size. Therefore, further study should be made, based on larger samples, to further explore and study the impact of cultural differences on business and IT alignment scores. Such studies can expand the comparison between Belgian and Dutch results, but could also address cultural differences between other nations worldwide  References  1  A VOLIO   B  K AHAI   S    D ODGE   G. \(2000 E-leadership Implications for theory, research, and practice Leadership Quarterly, 11 \(4\, 615-668 2] B ATENBURG R. \(2007 E-procurement adoption by European Firms: A quantative analysis Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 13, 182-192 3  B IRGELEN   M VAN   R UYTER   K.D  J ONG   A.D    W TZELS M 2002 Customer evaluations of after-sale service contact modes An empirical analysis of national culture's consequences  International Journal of Research in Marketing, 19, 43-64 4  B OND M.H. \(1984 Hofstede's Culture Dimensions ; An Independent Validation Using Rokeach's Value Survey Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, Vol. 15, No. 4, 417-433 5  C HAN   Y.E  H UFF   S.L  B ARCLAY   D.W AND C OPELAND D.G 1997 Business Strategy Orientation, Information Systems Orientation and Strategic Alignment Information Systems Research, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 125-150 6  C HAN   Y.E. \(2002 Why Haven t we Mastered Alignment?

Figure 9 also highlights the difficulty in designing a dynamic algorithm that is stable for most network configurations For data point 5 and 9 jitter is difficult to predict based on the AR PRESET This variability is most likely a result of the tolerance mechanism presenting artifacts during certain network configurations If the algorithm chooses too aggressively for too many data flows the contention parameters are set more aggressively and performance in the network suffers Although jitter remains better than NoDiff for all data points in Figure 9 providing more consistent behavior should be a primary goal for future versions of the AA SD Video Jitter 0.07 0.06 0.05  0.04  0.03 0.02 0.01 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT and TS Nodes Figure 10 SD Video Jitter The average jitter for SD video is shown in Figure 10 This data represents a lower priority level and as compared to voice jitter in Figure 9 is able to provide better predictability The data still shows that performance for AA experiences greater variability than Normal but over most data points is better than both NoDiff and Normal HD video performance is similar to SD but has greater overall jitter and is therefore not shown Telemetry Jitter o 045 o 04 4 NoDiff Normal 0 035 AA 0 03 025 0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT Nodes 11 0.015 0.01 0.0050 Figure 11 Telemetry Jitter In Figure 11 which shows the jitter for Telemetry the data exhibits similar characteristics as the data for voice jitter Due to inconsistencies in the settling of the algorithm performance does not follow the same curve as NoDiff or Normal however for most data points the performance is better than NoDiff Figure 12 Command Round Trip Time The RTT for Command data is shown in Figure 12 Similar conclusions can be drawn from this data as have been discussed previously This data also exhibits greater variability than Normal and better overall performance than NoDiff The behavior of AA closely resembles that of AA in Figure 11 which reinforces the conclusion that the builtin hysteresis of the algorithm does not fully accommodate all network configurations Overall the Adaptive Algorithm is able to meet its goals of being a distributed way to dynamically manage priority and still perform similarly to static prioritization and better than no differentiation at all The self correcting characteristic of the algorithm leads to increased variability in performance which in some cases such as extreme network load causes the Adaptive Algorithm to perform significantly worse than static prioritization On the other hand network throughput is improved when the network is under-utilized because the Adaptive Algorithm is only engaged when performance requirements are not being met When viewed as a trade-off between simplicity of deployment and performance benefits over non-prioritized networks the Adaptive Algorithm can provide significant value to network architects and TS 


9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented an extension to 802.1l e that dynamically adapts the contention parameters to meet performance requirements of lunar communications We have explored the capacity of 802.1lg using dynamic 802.1le to handle VoIP command telemetry and video according to their respective QoS requirements The data presented here shows that the Adaptive Algorithm can be deployed in these scenarios to effectively manage priority without a complicated centralized infrastructure This capability will be essential for short-range lunar communications in that quick deployment will be a primary goal The prevalence of 802.11 hardware and the possibility of the 2.4GHz band to perform at long and short ranges make it a viable option for future lunar networks However priority will be a necessity especially if the network carries non-critical traffic alongside mission-critical VoIP and data Future work on the algorithm will include improvement to the tolerance mechanism to reduce added contention from over-adjustment It is possible that more testing with more conservative settings will result in less variable network conditions at the expense of faster convergence Although we feel that the algorithm presented here is important we believe it is not the total solution It has been shown in previous works that in general 802.1 le increases contention in the network which results in overall lower throughput The Adaptive Algorithm does alleviate this disadvantage for some scenarios but not all Other works show that 802.1 le under the HCCA can solve the problem of throughput at the expense of simplicity and rapid deployment Therefore we expect that many 802.11 e deployments will use a mix of pure EDCA and HCCA in addition to using EDCA as a backup measure for HCCA Having an efficient and simple way to use ECDA will provide network architects with greater flexibility and will further reduce dependence on proprietary network design as we move towards expansion beyond the Earth 10 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at Clemson University under the South Carolina Space Grant Consortium Research and Education Awards Program REAP and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 lb 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 IEEE 1999 2 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 le 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 Amendment 8 IEEE 1999 3 Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM Support for Multimedia Applications with Quality of Service in Wi-Fi Networks Wi-Fi Alliance September 1 2004 4 Swaminathan Arvind and James Martin 2006 Fairness Issues in Hybrid 802.1 lb/e Networks Consumer Communications and Networking Conference 2006 3rd IEEE Vol 1 Issue 8-10 50-54 5 Wietholter Sven and Hoene Christian 2003 Design and Verification of an IEEE 802.1 le EDCA Simulation Model in ns-2.26 TKN Technical Report Series Technical University Berlin November 2003 6 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 Dynamic Tuning of the IEEE 802.11 Protocol to Achieve a Theoretical Throughput Limit IEEE/ACM Transactions On Networking Vol 8 No 6 December 2000 785-799 7 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 IEEE 802.11 Protocol Design and Performance Evaluation of an Adaptive Backoff Mechanism IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications Vol 18 No 9 September 8 Chen D S Garg M Kappes K Trivedi 2002 Supporting VBR VoIP Traffic in IEEE 802.11 WLAN in PCF Mode Center for Advanced Computing and Communications ECE Department Duke University Durham NC Avaya Labs Research New Jersey 9 Siris Vasilios and Stamatakis George 2006 Optimal CWmin Selection for Achieving Proportional Fairness in Multi-Rate 802.1 le WLANs Test-bed Implementation and Evaluation International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking WiNTECH 06 10 He Dajiang and Charles Shen 2003 Simulation Study of IEEE 802.1l e EDCA Vehicular Technology Conference Spring 2003 Vol 1 685-689 12 ILREFERENCES

14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
