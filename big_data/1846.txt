Data Analysis and Mining in Ordered Information Tables Ying Sai Y.Y Yao Department of Computer Science University of Regina Regina, Saskatchewan Canada S4S OA2 E-mail yyao cs.uregina.ca Abstract Many real world problems deal with ordering objects in stead of classifying objects although majority of research in machine learning and data mining has been focused on the latte For modeling ordering problems we generalize the notion of information tables to ordered information tables by adding order relations on 
attribute values The problem of mining ordering rules is formulated as finding associa tion between orderings of attribute values and the overall ordering of objects An ordering rules may state that 223ifthe value of an object x on an attribute a is ordered ahead of the value of another object y on the same attribute then x is ordered ahead of y 224 For mining ordering rules we$rst transform an ordered information table into a 
binary infor mation and then apply any standard machine learning and data mining algorithms As an illustration we analyze in detail Maclean\222s universities ranking for the year 2000 1 Introduction In real world situations we may be faced with many problems that are not simply classification  1,7 One such type of problems is the ordering of objects Two familiar examples are the ranking of universities and the ranking of consumer products produced by different manufacturers In both examples we have a set of attributes that are used to 
describe the objects under consideration. Consider the ex ample of ranking consumer products Attributes may be the price warranty and other information The values of a particular attribute say the price naturally induce an or dering of objects The overall ranking of products may be produced by their-market shares of different manufacturers The orderings of objects by attribute values may not neces sarily be the same as the overall ordering of objects In this setting a number of important issues arise It would be in teresting to know which attributes play more important roles in determining the overall ordering and which attributes do

problem of mining ordering rules can be described as follows There is a set of objects de scribed by a set of attributes There is an ordering on values of each attribute and there is also an overall ordering of ob jects The overall ordering may be given by experts or ob tained from other information either dependent or indepen dent of the orderings of objects according to their attribute values We are interested in mining the association between the overall ordering and the individual orderings induced by different attributes More specifically we want to derive or dering rules exemplified by 
the statement that 223if the value of an object x on an attribute a is ordered ahead of the value of another object y on the same attribute then IC is ordered ahead of y\224 The notion of ordered information tables is introduced as a generalization of information tables As a starting point we focus on the dependency of attributes The notions of reducts and core which have been studied extensively in the literature of rough sets 6 are derivable from the de pendency of attributes and play an important role in 
mining ordering rules In mining ordering rules we first transform an ordered information table into a binary information, and then apply any standard machine learning and data mining algorithms Ordered information tables are related to ordinal infor mation systems proposed and studied by Iwinski 4 Order ings induced by attribute values in information tables were also considered by Greco, Matarazzo and Slowinski 2 31 They addressed the problem of finding ordering rules by approximating preference relations through dominance re lations They also discussed approach of transforming an ordered information table into a binary table and mining the 497 


corresponding binary table However they suggested that the method is not very suitable in some situations for deci sion making. Instead they proposed a method based on the approximation of a preference relation by dominance rela tions in which certain parameters must be determined by experiments. Although their method may be more general it does not provide a pure qualitative framework which may be important for the analysis of ordered information tables Furthermore, one may gain more insights by studying a less general model 2 Ordered Information Tables In many information processing systems, objects are typ ically represented by their values on a finite set of attributes Such information may be conveniently described in a tabu lar form 6 The rows of the table correspond to objects of the universe, the columns correspond to a set of attributes and each cell gives the value of an object with respect to an attribute Definition 1 An information table is a quadruple IT  U,At Va I a E At I I a E At where U is a finite nonempty set of objects At is a finite nonempty set of attributes Va is a nonempty set of values for a E At I  U f V is an information function For simplicity we have considered only information ta bles characterized by a finite set of objects and a finite set of attributes Each information function 1 is a total function that maps an object of U to exactly one value in Va An information table represents all available information and knowledge about the objects under consideration Objects are only perceived, observed or measured by using a finite number of properties An information table does not consider any semantic re lationships between distinct values of a particular attribute By incorporating semantics information we may obtain dif ferent generalizations of information tables  121 General ized information tables may be viewed as information tables with added semantics In this paper we introduce order re lations on attribute values Definition 2 Let U be a nonempty set and  be a binary relation on U The relation  is a weak order fit satisjies the two properties Asymmetry  x  Y  Y t x   Y Y  z  x   Negative transitivity  An important implication of a weak order is that the fol lowing relation x  Y  5  Y Y  XI 1 is an equivalence relation For two elements if x w y we say x and y are indiscernible by t  The equivalence relation N induces a partition U on U and an order relation  on U can be defined by  Y   y 2 where XI is the equivalence class containing x Moreover t is a linear order Any two distinct equivalence classes of U can be compared It is therefore possible to arrange the objects into levels with each level consisting of indis cernible elements defined by t For a weak order x t y can be written as y x or 5 5 y which means y  x or y  x For any two elements x and y we have either x  y or y  x but not both Definition 3 An ordered information table is a pair OIT IT a a 200At where IT is a standard information table and  is a weak order on V An ordering of values of a particular attribute a naturally 3 where I denotes an order relation on U induced by the attribute a An object x is ranked ahead of another object y if and only if the value of x on the attribute a is ranked ahead of the value of y on a The relation fa has exactly the same properties as that of a For a subset of attributes A G At we define induces an ordering of objects, namely for x y E U z a Y  Ia\(z a Ia\(y z A Y  a E A[Ia\(x a Ia\(y  A Ia\(z a Ia\(y  n a  4 aEA aEA That is x is ranked ahead of y if and only if x is ranked ahead of y according to all attributes in A The above defini tion is a straightforward generalization of the standard def inition of equivalence relations in rough set theory, where the equality relation  is used 6 Mining ordering rules based on order relations is a concrete example of applica tions of our earlier studies on generalizations of rough set model with non-equivalence relations l 1 131 For simplicity we also assume that there is a special at tribute, called the decision attribute The ordering of objects by the decision attribute is denoted by to and is called the overall ordering of objects 498

It is interesting to note that  Ic,d is not a weak ordex That is the intersection of two weak orders may not produce a weak order This suggests that rules using simple condition AaEA I x a I y might not be very useful 3 Analyzing Ordered Information Tables In an ordered information table OIT an atomic expres sion over a single attribute a is defined as either a  or a 5 For a set of attributes A  At an expression over A in OIT is defined by AaEA e\(a where e\(a is an atomic expression over a The set of all expressions over A in an ordered information table 017 is denoted by E\(A In gen eral we may also consider expressions connected by other logic connectives such as 7 and V For simplicity we re strict our discussion to only A In an ordered information table we deals with pairs of objects We will not consider the object pairs x,x The universal set is thus given by U x U  U x U   z z 1 z E U   x, y I x y E U x  y The meanings of the expressions are given as follows m\(a  z z,Y E U x U I Ia\(x a la m\(a 5  2 E U x U I la\(x ia Ia\(y m A e\(a  n m\(e\(a QEA aEA An object pair z,y satisfies an expression 4 written x,y k 4 if the order as specified by the expression q5 is x y The set m\(q5 consists of all object pairs that sat isfy the expressed  For the set of expressions E\(A the family m  8 I q5 E E\(A forms a partition of U x U denoted by P\(A Each object pair satisfies one and only one expres sion from E\(A Definition4 An attribute set B depends on another at tribute set A or A determines B written A  B ifand only if P\(A is afinerpartition of P\(B namely for each equivalence class X E P\(A there exist an equivalence class Y E P\(B such that X C Y Suppose B depends on A For any expression  E E\(A if an object pair IC y E U x U satisfies 4 i.e z y k 4 then there exists a corresponding expression  E E\(B such that IC y k  The ordering of objects by A determines the ordering of objects by B Definition 5 Two attribute sets A B ifandonly ifP\(A  P\(B At are equivalent Two sets of attributes A and B are equivalent if and only if A depends on B and B depends on A The ordering of objects by A determines the ordering of objects by B and vice versa Regarding the ordering of objects A and B con tain exactly the same information Definition 6 An attribute a E A is dispensable in A ifand only ifA and A  a are equivalent; otherwise a is indis pensable in A Definition 7 An attribute set A is an independent set ifand only if every a E A is indispensable; otherwise A is a de pendent set Each attribute in an independent attribute set contributes to the ordering of objects Definition 8 A subset B 5 A is a reduct of A ifand only if B is an independent set and is equivalent to A 499 


A reduct B G A is a minimal subset of A in the sense that it does not contain any dispensable attributes and pro duces the ordering of objects as given by A Typically a set of attributes may have many reducts The set of all reducts of an attribute set A is denoted by RED\(A Definition 9 The set of all indispensable elements of A is called the core of A and is denoted by CORE\(A An attribute in the core must be in every reduct Thus we have CORE\(A  nRED\(A 5  The set of attributes CORE\(A are so essential that they can not be eliminated without losing the ordering informa tion provided by A The core may be empty Definition 10 An attribute a E A is absolutely dispensable in A if it does not belong to any reduct namely a E A  U RED\(A An absolutely dispensable attribute does not contribute at all to ordering of objects based on A Example 2 Let U  5 y z and A  a b c Consider the order relations induced by the three attributes a c XI a YI a zl I c YI c XI b 1.1 b 27Y17 For the entire set of attributes we have b c  a  A b 3 A c 31 a 3 A b 3 A c I a 5 A b  A c     For clarity we only explicitly give the expressions whose meanings are nonempty sets of object pairs The corre sponding partition P a b c is given by m\(\(a1 A b 5 A c 5  z Y 5 z Y z m\(\(a15 A b 5 A c   Yl z m\(\(a 3 4  A c   z,z Z1Y For the subset of attributes a b we have E b  a  A b 3 a 3 A b 3 a 5 A 4 I 222 I which induces the partition P  a b m\(\(a1 A b 5  z Y z z Y z m\(\(a 5 A b 5  Y,Z m\(\(a15 A b   z x 2  Since P\({a b c  P\({a b the attribute sets a b c and a b are equivalent It can be easily ver@ed that P\({al b  P\({a and P\({a b  P\({b Thus, the attribute set a b is an independent set and is a reduct of A Another reduct is given by b c We have RED\(A  a b b c and CORE\(A  b There is no abso lute dispensable attribute The concepts of dependency, dispensable attributes and reduct capture the connections between attributes with re spect to ordering produced by a set A They provide us with a basis for analyzing and simplifying an ordered in formation table by removing certain attribute without loss of information In some situations it is necessary to study relationship between attributes relative to the overall order ing of objects In what follows we consider an ordered information table with a decision attribute 0 i.e., the overall ordering of objects All the concepts developed so far can be easily extended Definition 11 Let A For an expression  E E\(A we say o depends on A de noted by A  0 if and only ifm m\(o or At be an attribute set m\(4 c 740 5 While dependency of attributes show global connection between attributes, +-dependency shows local connection Assume o depends on A If any two objects satisfy the particular orderings specified by  on A one can tell their ordering by 0 Definition 12 Let A B 2 At Two attributes sets A and B are equivalent with respect to 0 ifand only if U MJ4  U M0\(4\222 6 EE\(A d\222EE\(B where Mo\(q5 is defined by If A and B are equivalent with respect to 0 any two ob jects that can be properly ordered on o according to A must be properly ordered according to B and vice versa Definition 13 An attribute a E A is dispensable with re spect to o ifand only ifA and A  a are equivalent with respect to 0 otherwise a is indispensable with respect to 0 Definition 14 An attribute set A is an independent set with respect to 0 if and only if there is no dispensable attribute in A with respect to 0 Definition 15 A subset B C A is a reduct of A with respect to 0 ifand only if B is an independent set and equivalent to A with respect to 0 500 


A reduct B C A with respect to o is sometimes called a relative reduct of A with respect to 0 It consists of a minimal subset of attributes of A that provides the same ordering of objects on o as A itself A set of attributes may have more than one relative reduct The set of all relative reducts of an attribute set A is denoted by RED,\(A Definition 16 The set of all indispensable elements of A with respect to o is called the core of A with respect to o and is denoted by COREo\(A Similarly, the core of A with respect to o is called a rela tive core The relative core of A is the intersection of all its relative reducts CORE,\(A  n RED,\(A 8 A relative core may be empty Attributes in a nonempty relative core play essential roles in describing the overall ordering induced by 0 Example 3 Let U  x y z A  a b c and At  A U o Consider order relations induced by attributes given by For the set a b c we have The relationships between orderings induced by a b c and o can be seen as follows For the subset a b we obtain E bl  a  A b 3 a I A bI a1 5 A b 3 a 5 A b   M 4 41 42 We have 7442  Y c do I 44  z c 40  d4  I z SI z Y c m\(o,3 m\(42  Y,Z c m\(o and U MO@\222  U x U d\222EE\({a,b Since U+EE\(A MO\(4  UqEE\({a,b attribute sets a b c and a b are equivalent with respect to 0 It is easy to check that a and b are not equivalent to A i.e the attribute set a b is an independent set and is is a relative reduct One can also show that c is the other relative reduct of A Hence we have RED,\(A  a b c and CORE,\(A  0 4 Mining Ordering Rules Data mining in an ordered information table may be for mulated as finding association between orderings induced by attributes One is interested in finding associations be tween two arbitrary subsets of attributes A and B Definition 17 Consider two subsets of attributes A B c At For two expressions 4 E E\(A and 1c E E\(B an ordering rule is read 221\221$4 then 1c 222\222 and denoted by 4   The expression 4 is called the rule\222s antecedent, while the expression 1c is called the rule\222s consequent An ordering rule states how orderings of objects by at tributes in A determines orderings of objects by attributes in B For example an ordering rule can be re-expressed as x a y A d{b Y  x c y That is for two arbitrary objects x and y if x is ranked ahead of y by attribute a and at the same time 2 is not ranked ahead of y by attribute b then x is ranked ahead of y by attribute c We adopt conditional probabilistic interpre tations for ordering rules A systematic analysis of proba bility related quantities associated with rules was given by Yao and Zhong  161 We choose to use two measures called accuracy and coverage lo 501 


Definition 18 The accuracy and coverage of an ordering rule 4   are dejned respectively by where I  I denotes the cardinality of a set The quantity accuracy   gives a measure of the correctness of the rule, and coverage\(4   gives a mea sure of the applicability of the rule In the extreme case if accuracy  1 the ordering by 4 would determine the ordering by  If coverage  1 the rule states something about the entire ordering by  The accuracy and coverage are not independent of each other, as both are related to the quantity Im\(4 A  It is desirable for a rule to be accurate as well as to have a high degree of coverage In general, one may observe a trade-off between accuracy and coverage A rule with higher coverage may have a lower accuracy, while a rule with higher accuracy may have a lower coverage Example 4 From the data in Example I we can get for example two ordering rules b,3 A c 3  0,517 c I  0  accuracy  1.0 coverage  0.615 accuracy  0.625 coverage  0.714 To mine ordering rules from an ordered information ta ble we transform an ordered information table into a binary information Any standard data mining algorithms can be immediately applied In the binary information table we consider object pairs x y E U x U The information function is defined by Statements in an ordered information table can be translated into equivalent statements in the binary information table For example x a y can be translated into la\(x U  1 In the translation process we will not consider object pairs of the form z z as we are not interested in them In our approach, the interpretation of an ordered infor mation table and the translation to a binary information ta ble are crucial. Once we obtain the binary information table any existing data mining algorithm can be used to mine or dering rules. For example, using Rosetta a rough set toolkit for analyzing data one can obtain a set of minimal order ing rules from reducts with certain properties 9 A well known machine learning system C4.5 can also be used to learn ordering rules  81 abcd 1011 0010 0010 0100 0000 0000 0000 0100 1001 1001 0000 0100 1001 1011 0011 0100 1001 1011 0011 0010  0  1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0  Table 2 A binary information table derived from an ordered information table Example 5 Consider the ordered information table in Ex ample I It can be transformed into the binary information table, given by Table 2 For this table we obtain a reduct consisting of  b c Examples of rules are given by RI  h 5 A c 5  0,5 accuracy  1 coverage  0.615 R2  R3 c   0  6   0 I accuracy  0.625 coverage 2210.714 accuracy  0.5 coverage  0.286 For Rz it can be paraphrazed as saying that ifx tC y then x o y with accuracy 0.625 and coverage 0.714 One may use other types of translation methods. For ex ample we may consider two strict order relations  and 4 instead of  and 5 Alternatively, one may translate an ordered information table into a three-valued information table corresponding to  4 and  Greco Matarazzo and Slowinski used graded preference relations which pro duce a multi-valued information table 3 By translating an ordered information table into a multi-valued information table, one may consider magnitudes of attribute values. Un fortunately it may be difficult to interpret these magnitudes They must be obtained from either experts or experiments 502 


For this reason we focus on the binary information table approach It is important to realize that the framework pre sented in this paper can be easily applied with very simple modification 5 A Real World Example To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model we analyze the data from the Maclean\222s universities 2000 ranking 5 The Maclean\222s ranking compared universities with similar structures and man dates All universities in Canada are classified into one of three categories MedicallDoctoral universities Com prehensive universities and Primarily Undergraduate uni versities Maclean\222s ranked 15 MedicalDoctoral universi ties based on 22 performance measure that are divided into six groupings namely Student Body 22%\Classes \(17 Faculty 17 Finances \(12%\Library \(12  and Repu tation 20 where the weights in the parentheses indicate the contributions of the measures to the overall ranking Ta ble 3 summarizes the ranking measures The 22 performance measures produce 22 individual rankings and an overall ranking suggested by Maclean\222s The details can be found in the November issue of Maclean\222s 5 Using data analysis and data mining method introduced earlier we can find reduct\(s and the core of the ordered information table We can also induce ordering rules which state association between the overall ranking and the rankings by 22 performance measures For our experiment we used the Rosetta a rough set toolkit for analyzing data 9 We found that there are sev eral reducts for this information table One reduct with the minimal set length for explanation is cl f3 fi3,14 rl s2 s5 This suggests that one can use seven measures to pro vides the same overall ranking of universities as given by Maclean\222s. The total weight of the seven measures is only 30.8 In addition, measures in this reduct do not necessar ily have the highest weights among performance measures The number of measures in the reduct and the total weight are less than 1/3 of the ones used in the entire table We also find that the core is empty, which means that there does not exist a measure that is absolutely essential for producing the overall ranking. These observations are interesting as they indicate that some measures used by Maclean\222s may not be necessary and moreover the weights may not necessarily reflect the importance of measures in producing the overall ranking Another interesting observation of the the reduct cl f3 fi3 14 rl s2 s5 is that it contains at least one measure from each of the six categories Many ordering rules were found by using Rosetta As examples we list some rules with accuracy 1 and the high est degrees of coverage RI  f4  A fi3  A 2   0  coverage  0.6 coverage  0.590476 R2  f2  A f23  A 1   0  R3  f23  A rl  A s2   0  R4  f 1  A fG  A SI  0 Il R.5  f4 coverage  0.590476 coverage  0.580952 A 2  A 2   0  coverage  0.580952 R6  f4  A fi31 A 31   0  coverage  0.571429 All the rules use only three performance measures Even using such a small number of measures one can correctly state close to 60 of the overall ranking Although the preliminary results obtained from the Maclean\222s university ranking may need further study in depth analysis and careful interpretation they at least present another point of view to look at the important is sue of university ranking An added advantage is that our method is of qualitative nature without considering any quantitative information 6 Conclusions Ordering of objects is a fundamental issue in human de cision making and may play a significant role in the design of intelligent information systems. This problem is consid ered from the perspective of data mining The commonly used attribute value approaches are extended by introducing order relations on attribute values A data analysis model is thus proposed to describe properties of ordered information tables Mining ordering rules is formulated as the process of finding associations between orderings on attribute val ues and the overall ordering of objects These ordering rules tell us or explain how objects should be ranked according to orderings on their attribute values The proposed solution for mining ordering rules is sim ple Our main contribution is the formulation of the prob lem and the translation of the problem to existing data mining problem.

Such a small mod ification to the original HPA algorithm could improve the linearity substantially 4.6 Effect of increasing transaction Figure 13 shows the effect of increasing transac tion database sue as the number of transactions is increased from 256,000 to 2 million transactions We used the data set t15.14 The behavior of the results does not change with increased database size The minimum support value was set to 0.4 The num ber of processors is kept at 16 As shown each of the parallel algorithms attains linearity 5 Summary and related work In this paper we proposed four parallel algorithms for mining association rules A summary of the four database size Sizeup 0 I 0 500 loo0 1500 uxw amount of transaction thousands Figure 13 Sizeup curve algorithms is shown in Table 5 In NPA the candi date itemsets are just copied amongst all the proces sors Each processor works on the entire candidate itemsets NPA requires no data transfer when the supports are counted However in the case where the entire candidate itemsets do not fit within the mem ory of a single processor the candidate itemsets are divided and the supports are counted by scanning the transaction database repeatedly Thus Disk 1/0 cost of NPA is high PDM, proposed in 6 is the same as NPA which copies the candidate itemsets among all the processors Disk 1/0 for PDM should be also high The remaining three algorithms SPA HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets over the memory space of all the processors Because it better exploits the total system's memory, disk 1/0 cost is low SPA arbitrarily partitions the candidate itemsets equally among the processors Since each processor broadcasts its local transaction data to all other pro cessors the communication cost is high HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets using a hash function which eliminates the need for transac tion data broadcasting and can reduce the comparison workload significantly HPA-ELD detects frequently occurring itemsets and handles them separately which can reduce the influence of the workload skew 6 Conclusions Since mining association rules requires several scans of the transaction file its computational requirements are too large for a single processor to have a reasonable response time This motivates our research In this paper we proposed four different parallel algorithms for mining association rules on a shared nothing parallel machine and examined their viabil 29 


Table 5 characteristics of algorithms ity through implementation on a 64 node parallel ma chine the Fujitsu AP1000DDV If a single processor can hold all the candidate item sets parallelization is straightforward It is just suf ficient to partition the transaction over the proces sors and for each processor to process the allocated transaction data in parallel We named this algo rithm NPA However when we try to do large scale data mining against a very large transaction file the candidate itemsets become too large to fit within the main memory of a single processor In addition to the size of a transaction file a small minimum support also increases the size of the candidate itemsets As we decrease the minimum support computation time grows rapidly but in many cases we can discover more interesting association rules SPA HPA and HPA-ELD not only partition the transaction file but partition the candidate itemsets among all the processors We implemented these al gorithms on a shard-nothing parallel machine Per formance evaluations show that the best algorithm HPA-ELD attains good linearity on speedup by fully utilizing all the available memory space which is also effective for skew handling At present we are doing the parallelization of mining generalized association rules described in 9 which includes the taxonomy is-a hierarchy Each item belongs to its own class hierarchy In such mining associations between the higher class and the lower class are also examined Thus the candidate itemset space becomes much larger and its computation time also takes even longer than the naive single level association mining Parallel pro cessing is essential for such heavy mining processing Acknowledgments This research is partially supported as a priority research program by ministry of education We would like to thank the F\221ujitsu Parallel Computing Research Center for allowing us to use their APlOOODDV sys tems References l R.Agrawal T.Imielinski and ASwami 223Min ing Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Manage ment of Data pp207-216 May 1993 2 R.Agrawal and RSrikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.487-499 September 1994 3 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223An Effec tive Hash-Based Algorithm for Mining Associ ation Rules\224 In Proc of the 1995 ACM SIG MOD International Conference on the Manage ment of Data SIGMOD Record Vo1.24 pp.175 186 June 1995 4 H.Mannila H.Toivonen and A.I.Verkamo 223Ef ficient Algorithms for Discovering Association Rules\224 In KDD-94:AAAI Workshop on Knowl edge Discovery in Databases pp.181-192 July 1994 5 A.Savasere, E.Omiecinski and S.Navathe 223An Effective Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 21th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.432-444 September 1995 6 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223Efficient Parallel Data Mining for Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 4th International Conference on In formation and Knowledge Management pp.31 36 November 1995 7 T.Shintani and M.Kitsuregawa 223Considera tion on Parallelization of Database Mining\224 In Institute of Electronics Information and Com munication Engineering Japan SIG CPS Y95 88 Technical Report Vo1.95 No.47 pp.57-62 December 1995 8 T.Shimizu T.Horie and H.Ishihata 223Perfor mance Evaluation of the APlOOO Effects of message handling broadcast and barrier syn chronization on benchmark performance-\224  In S WO PP 22292 9.2 ARC 95 Information Processing Society of Japan Vo1.92 No.64 1992 9 R.Srikant and R.Agrawal 223Mining Generalized Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 21th Inter national Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.407-419 September 1995 30
