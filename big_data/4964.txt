analytical solution for the problem of the average distance of the SCC graph We divide the cost of a route in the SCC graph into three components and show that one of such components is affected by the routing algorithm being used Three routing algorithms for the SCC graph are presented which respectively employ random greedy and minimal routing rules The computa tional complexities of the algorithms and the average costs of the paths they produce are compared, Finally we discuss how the algorithms presented in this paper can be used in association with wormhole routing 1 Introduction An interconnection 
network is characterized by four dis tinct aspects topology routing,jlow control and switching  111 The topology of a network defines how the nodes are interconnected by links and is usually modeled by a graph Routing determines the path selected by a packet to reach its destination and is usually specified by means of a rout ing algorithm Flow control deals with the allocation of links and buffers to a packet as it is routed through the net work Switching determines the mechanism by which data is moved from an incoming link to an 
outgoing link of a node e.g store-and-forward, circuit switching, virtual cut through and wormhole routing are examples of switching techniques found in parallel architectures In this paper we continue the study of topological and routing aspects of the star-connected cycles SCC intercon nection network lo which was recently proposed as an attractive extension of the star graph  11 An SCC graph is related to a star graph in the same way a cube-connected This research was supported in part by Conselho Nacional de Desen volvimento Cientifico e Tecnol6gico CNPq  Brazil under the grant No 200392/92 1 0-8186-'7683-3196 05.00 0 
1996 IEEE cycles graph I21 is related to a hypercube Namely an SCC graph is formed from a star graph by replacing the nodes of the latter with cyc:les or rings of nodes The SCC graph constitutes an efficient architecture for execution of parallel algorithms which include broadcasting 2 and FFT  141 Mesh algorithms are ailso supported in SCC graphs via embeddings 3 The SCC graph inherits many of the in teresting properties of the star graph  11 while employing at most three VO ports per node This last 
aspect catego rizes the SCC graph as a bounded-degree network other examples arc in 12 151 Networks with bounded degree favor area-efficient VLSI layouts and scale more easily than variable-degree networks Previously known topological aspects of SCC graphs in clude degree symmetry di ameter and fault-diameter and were derived in 4 101 Here we continue the study of these by investigating the average distance or average diameter of SCC graphs Our interest in this property is twofold 1 to obtain a metric for comparing the performance of routing algorithms and 2 to provide continued characterization 
of the graph theoretical aspects of SCC networks In the absence of other network traffic, modern switching techniques e.g., wormhole routing achieve a communi cation latency which is virtually independent of the selected path length I 11 In this ideal environment, the two factors which contribute to the communication latency experienced by a packet are the start-up latency and the network latency  111 In a realistic environment in which congestion oc curs however a third factor known as blocking time also contributes to the communication latency Regardless of the flow control and switchingmechanisms being used in the network congestion can usually be mini 
mized if fewer links are used when routing apacket  For communication-intensive parallel applications, the blocking time \(and, consequently the communication latency is ex pected to grow with path length In such cases a routing algorithm should ideally compute paths whose average cost matches the average distame of the network In this paper we show routes in an SCC graph may contain up to three classes of links which we refer to as lateral links MI local links and MB local links see Sec 3 for definitions Exact expressions for the average number 443 


of lateral links and MI local links between two nodes in an SCC graph and an upper bound on the average number of MB local links are derived When combined these expressions produce a tight upper bound on the average distance of the SCC graph We show that the number of MB local links is affected by the routing algorithm being used, and propose three dif ferent algorithms for the SCC graph random greedy and minimal routing The proposed routing algorithms are com pared according to criteria such as computational complexity which affects their implementation in hardware and aver age routing cost for which figures were obtained by means of simulation The results obtained with the minimal rout ing algorithm provide exact numeric solutions for the aver age distance of SCC graphs Our simulations indicate that the greedy routing algorithm performs close to the minimal routing algorithm while requiring a smaller complexity We show that the random routing algorithm presents the small est complexity among the three algorithms described in this paper, and provide average and worst-case routing cost met rics for it. Finally we discuss how the three algorithms can be implemented in combination with wormhole routing 6 2 Background 2.1 The star graph An n-dimensional star graph, denoted by S contains n nodes which are labeled with then possiblepermutations of n distinct symbols In this paper, we use the integers 1    n to label the nodes of Sn A node a  pl   pa  pn is connected to n 1 distinct nodes,respectively labeled with permutations ai  pi    pi-1p1pi+l   pn 2 5 i 5 n i.e a is the permutation resulting from exchanging the symbols occupying the first and the ith position in a l Each of these n  1 possible exchange operations is referred to as a generator of Sa Two nodes a and ai of S are connected by a link iff there is a generator gi such that a  gi  ai The link connecting T and ai is referred to as an ith-dimension link and is labeled i S has n  1  n!/2 links S is a regular graph with degree S\(Sn  n  1 and diameter 4\(Sn  3\(n  l S is vertex- and edge-symmetric and has hierarchical structure The degree and diameter of S are sublogarithmic on the size of the graph l which makes the star graph compare favorably with the hypercube 2.2 The star-connected cycles SCC graph An n-dimensional SCC graph, denoted by SCC is a bounded-degree variant of S lo SCC is formed by replacing each node of S with a supernode i.e a ring of n  1 nodes The connections between nodes inside the same supernode are referred to as local links Each supernode is connected to n  1 adjacent supernodes using lateral links inherited from S  Figure 1 shows SCC Nodes in SCC are identified by a label i a where i is an integer such that 2 5 i 5 n and a is a permutation of n symbols Two nodes i a and i\221 w\221 are connected by a link  i a i\222 T\222 in SCC iff either 1 i a i\222 T\221 is alocallink,i.e T  a\222andmin\(~i-i\222~,n-l-~i-i\222  1 or2 i T i\222 a\222 is alaterai link i.e i  i\221 and a differs from a\222 only in the first and the ith symbols such that a\(1  222\(i and i  222\(1 3,34121 II 13.1243 2,41231 3.1342 12.4132 4,31421 14,2143 Figure 1 The SCC graph For similarity with S the label of the supernode con taining nodes 2 a   n T is T Also the lateral link connected to node i a is labeled i For simplicity supern ode and lateral link labels are not shown in Fig 1 SCC contains n  1 n nodes n  1 n local links and n  1  n!/2 lateral links Thus the size of SCC is comparable to that of Sn+l Local links account for 2/3 of the links of SCC and can be laid out very efficiently due to the ring topology of the supernodes Moreover SCC has about n times fewer lateral links than Sn+l which further reduces the complexity of a VLSI layout for SCC when compared to Sn+l SCC is vertex-symmetric and has degree S\(SCC  2 for n  3 and S\(SCC  3 for n 2 4 In addition, the diameter of SCC is given by  101 for n  3 for even n 1  n  4  3n  S for odd n 2 5 3 Average distance of the SCC graph 3.1 Preliminaries Let the cost of aroute P between node i a and theiden tity node io ag  2,12   n in SCC be d  lat  Zoc where lat and loc respectively denote the number of lateral links and the number of local links in P Because SCC is vertex-symmetric its average distance can be computed by finding minimal cost routes to the identity from every node in the graph and averaging those over n  1  n 444 


Before we can derive the average distance of SCC  some definitions related to lateral links are needed We may organize the symbols of permutation a as a set of r-cycles\222  i.e cyclically ordered sets of symbols with the property that each symbol\222s desired position is that occupied by the next symbol in the set In this paper r-cycles are written in canonical form 8 i.e the smallest symbol appears first in each r-cycle For example, a permutation a  265431 can be written in cyclic format as 1 2 3 4 Note that a symbol already in its correct position appears as a 1-cycle Let Ci  io   I be an r-cycle in a 2 5 r 5 n Let R  Ri be the permutation produced from a by moving the symbols in Ci to their correct positions The execution of an r-cycle Ci is by definition a minimal sequence of lateral links2 Ri leading from supernode a to supernode a  note that local links are not an issue here Ri can be expressed by 7,9 2 if io  1  i0,i1,...,ir-1,i ifio  1 In the case io  1 Ci can actually be executed with r different sequences of lateral links 7 91 Hence for j  0 4 r  1 such sequences can be expressed as ill iz    I Ri  ijmodr i\(j+l l i\(j+r-l ijmodr 3 The minimum number of lateral links in a route from supernode a to a0 does not depend on the order chosen to execute the r-cycles in a and is given with  11 if a\222s first symbol is 1 4  222 2 if a\222s first symbol is not 1 lat  where c is the number of r-cycles of length at least 2 in a and m is the total number of symbols in these r-cycles Routes in SCC often consist of sequences of lateral links interleaved with local links In what follows we give some definitions that relate to local links Recall that loc denotes the contribution of the local links to the total cost of a route P from i a to io TO loc can be further divided into two components which we denote by MI\(loc and MB\(loc and define as follows MI\(loc  the number of move-in MI local links existing in the route from i a to io TO By def inition, these are local links that must be traversed between two lateral links belonging to the execution sequence of an r-cycle in a MB\(loc  the number of move-between MB local links existing in the route from i a to io no By definition MB local links are 1 local links that must be traversed between the executions of two consecu tive r-cycles in a 2\local links that must be traversed r-cycles provide a convenient means to represent permutations 8 and should not be confused with physicul cycles or rings which constitute the supemodes of SCC  2Throughout the paper, we distinguish the notation of an r-cycle from that of a sequence of lateral links by using commas in the latter in supernode a and are required to move from i a to the lateral link that initiates the execution of the first r-cycle of a and 3 local links that must be tra versed in supernode TO and are required to move from the lateral link that finishes the execution of the last r-cycle of a to io  TO Thus d  lat  loc I lat  MI\(loc  MB\(l0c AS an example, consider routing from 3,34125 to 2,12345 in SCCs The cyclic representation of permutation 34125 is 1 3 2 4 5 One possible route uses the sequences of lateral links 2,4,2 and 3 Figure 2 shows the MI local links and the MB local links in such a route Supernode labels  A 5 21 5 2 5 2 5 21 5 21 Legend a Sourcenode 81 Destination node  Lateral link _ MI local link  MB local link Figure 2 Types of links in a route in SCCB Note that from the topological viewpoint there is no dis tinction between MI and MB local links A particular local link used by a route in SCC is considered to be either an MI or an MB local link depending on the conditions stated above. Therefore the same local link can be classified as an MI local link for some routes and as an MB local link for others The cost components lat MI\(loc and MB\(loc ex ist in any route in SCC although in some short routes one or more of these components may be null Due to vertex symmetry one cain derive the average distance of SCC by computing the average numbers of lateral links MI local links and MB local links in a route from i a to io  a We denote such average numbers by lat MI loc and MB loc respectively The average distance of SCC denoted by 4\(SCCn can then be expressed by   qqSCC  lat  MI\(l0C  MB\(l0c 5 Finally the average number of local links existing in a route from i a to io TO in SCCn is by definition    lac  MI\(l0C  MB\(l0C 3.2 Average number alf lateral links The number of lateral links in the route between any node of SCC and the identity node is exactly equal to the cost of the corresponding route in the underlying n-star graph  101 Therefore lat is exactly equal to the average distance of S which is given by  11  2 lat  n t H   4 n where H  CL is the nth Harmonic number 8 445 


3.3 Average number of MI local links The number of MI local links in a route in SCC can be calculated as follows Consider routing from i T to the identity node io TO and let the number of r-cycles of length at least 2 in T be c Let Ci  io  I be one of these r-cycles and let Ri be an execution sequence for Ci Eq 2 Moving between two consecutive lateral links i ib in Ri requires d\(i ib MI local links where lo d\(ia1ib  min\(li  ib1,n  1  li  ibl 7 The total number of MI local links that must be tra versed during the execution of C denoted by MI\(loc Ci is therefore the sum of the distances d\(i ib between all pairs of consecutive lateral links i ib in Ri Lemma 1 The number of MI local links that must be tra versed in a route between any two nodes of SCC is inde pendent of the order chosen to execute the r-cycles existing between those nodes Proof We first show that MI\(loc Ci does not depend on the sequence of lateral links Ri chosen to execute C If io  1 there is only one such sequence Eq 2 If io  1 there are r different possible sequences Eq 3 However due to the cyclic nature of these sequences they all have the same cost MI\(loc Cz Eq 8 By extension, the total number of MI local links in the route MI\(loc must also be an invariant 0 An immediate consequence of Lemma 1 is that the num ber of MI local links between two nodes of SCC can be derived without further considerations about routing As suming of course that routing is accomplished in adherence to Eqs 2 and 3 as is the case with all routing algorithms presented in this paper As an example, consider an r-cycle C  2 6 4 and let n  7 C can be executed with a sequence of lateral links R  2,6,4,2 The number of MI local links required in the execution of this sequence is MI\(loc C  d\(2,6  d\(6,4  d\(4,2  2  2  2  6 Theorem 1 The average number of MI local links that must be traversed in a route in SCC is Proof The average number of local links that must be traversed between two adjacent lateral links is The average number of local links that must be traversed in the execution of an r-cycle Ci  io   I is MI\(lOC,Ci   d\(1oc r  2 if io  1 if io  1 11  d\(1oc  r Over all n possible permutations of n symbols and for each integer T 2 5 r 5 n there is a total of n  l r-cycles that include symbol 1 io  1 and n!/r  n  l r-cycles that do not include symbol 1 io  1 The average number of MI local links over all n permutations is therefore 3.4 Average number of MB local links Recall that MB local links are needed to move between execution sequences of adjacent r-cycles 2 5 r 5 n to move into the first lateral link and to move out of the last lateral link in a route in SCCn Theorem 2 The average number of MB local links that must be traversed in a route in SCC under a random ordering of r-cycles is H,\(n  1  2 n2  3n  2 MB\(loc rand  Proof Over all n possible permutations of n symbols and for each integer r 2 5 r 5 n there is a total of n!/r r-cycles The total number of r-cycles of length at least 2 in the n Dossible Dermutations of n svmbols is. therefore N  x:=2\(n!/rj  n  H  1 I The average number of r-cycles 2 5 r 5 n in a per mutation of n symbols is F  N,/n  H  1 The average number-of MB local links that must be traversed between these r-cycles is MB\(loc mid  T-l doc  n-2 Let il n be the source node and the first lateral link in the route be ik 2 5 ik 5 n The average number of local links that must be traversed between i n and ik T   is d\(in   1 Cy=2 d\(i 2  k1 1W n-1 n-1  I   A  Note that d\(in differs from d\(loc Eq lo since to compute d\(in we must consider the case i  ik Simi larly, the average number of local links that must be tra versed between the last laterallinkin the route and the destination node is d\(out  d\(in Then the average number of MB local links that must be traversed in a route in SCC assuming a random ordering of r-cycles  446

in Tds to their correct posil.ions using the minimum number of lateral links given by Eq 4 In practice, the constraints placed on the number of vertices by the heuristics of Alg 3 i.e., the estimated minimum number of local links Mi limit the width of the search tree considerably Simulations car ried out for 4  n  9 revealed that a very small number of vertices is enabled at each step which makes the maximum width of the tree virtually proportional to m Figure 3 illus trates an example of the search tree constructed by Alg 3 The main computations incurred upon creation of a vertex of the

locally by the routing circuit of a node Because the routing algorithm is invoked multiple times while a packet is being routed the routing decision must be taken as fast as pos sible From this viewpoint it is important that the routing algorithm can be easily and efficiently rendered in hardware which favors the random routing algorithm over the greedy and minimal routing algorithms Besides being the most complex algorithm discussed in this paper the minimal routing algorithm includes a feature which precludes its distributed implementation in associa tion with wormhole routing namely its backtracking mech anism Distributed versions of the random and greedy al gorithms, however, can be used in combination with worm hole routing A near-minimal distributed routing algorithm which supports wormhole routing can be obtained by re moving the backtracking mechanism from Alg 3 Such an algorithm is likely to have computational complexity and average cost that lie between those of the greedy and the minimal routing algorithm Due to its non-deterministic nature the random routing algorithm also seems to be a good candidate for SCC net works employing distributed adaptive routing  1 I Adap tivity is desirable for example if the routing algorithm must dynamically respond to network conditions such as conges tion and faults Some degree of adaptivity is also possible in the greedy and minimal routing algorithms which in some cases can decide between paths of equal cost 7 Conclusion This paper compared the average cost and the complex ity of three different routing algorithms for the SCC graph We divided routes into three components \(lateral links MI local links and MB local links and showed that only the number of MB local links may be affected by the routing algorithm being considered Exact expressions for the aver age number of lateral links and the average number of MI local links were presented Also an upper bound for the average number of MZ local links was derived considering a random routing algorithm As a result a tight upper bound on the average distance of the SCC graph was obtained Simulation results for a random a greedy and a minimal routing algorithm were presented and compared with theo retical values The complexity of the proposed algorithms is respectively O\(n O\(n2 and O\(n3 where n is the dimensionality of the SCC grap.h The results under mini mal routing produce exact numerical values for the average distance of SCC for 3 5 n 5 9 Results for the greedy algorithm match those of the min imal algorithm for 3 2 n 5 4 The greedy algorithm also performs close to minimality for 5 5 n 5 9 and is an in teresting choice due to its O\(n2 complexity The random routing algorithm has an O\(n complexity and performs fairly well on the average but may introduce additional MB local links in the route under worst-case conditions Finally we discussed how each of the routing algorithms can be used in association with the wormhole routing switch ing technique Directions for future research in this area in clude an evaluation of requirements for deadlock avoidance e.g number of virtual channels References l S B Akers,D.

The data flows in continuously and is processed daily Mining association rules dynamically has the following benefits 267  223Real-time\224 data mining, that is, the rules are drawn from the latest transactions for reflecting the current commercial trends 267  Multilevel knowledge abstraction, which requires summarizing multiple partial results. For example association rules on the month or year basis cannot be concluded from daily mining results. In fact multilevel mining is incremental in nature 267  For scalability, incremental and distributed mining has become a practical choice Figure 3: Distributed rule mining Incremental association rule mining requires combining partial results. It is easy to see that the confidence and support of multiple rules may not be combined directly. This is why we treat them as \223views\224 and only maintain the association cube, the population cube and the base cube that can be updated from each new copy of volume cube. Below, we discuss several cases to show how a GDOS can mine association rules by incorporating the partial results computed at LDOSs 267  The first case is to sum up volume-cubes generated at multiple LDOSs. Let C v,i be the volume-cube generated at LDOS i The volume-cube generated at the GDOS by combining the volume-cubes fed from these LDOSs is 345   n i i v v C C 1  The association rules are then generated at the GDOS from the centralized C v  214  The second case is to mine local rules with distinct bases at participating LDOSs, resulting in a local association cube C a,I a local population cube C p,I  and a local base cube C b,i at each LDOS. At the GDOS, multiple association cubes, population cubes and base cubes sent from the LDOSs are simply combined, resulting in a summarized association cube and a summarized population cube, as 345   n i i a a C C 1   345   n i i p p C C 1  and 345   n i i b b C C 1  The corresponding confidence cube and support cube can then be derived as described earlier. Cross-sale association rules generated from distinct customers belong to this case In general, it is inappropriate to directly combine association cubes that cover areas a 1 205, a k to cover a larger area a In the given example, this is because association cubes record counts of customers that satisfy   customer product merchant time area Doe TV Dept Store 98Q1 California Doe VCR Dept Store 98Q1 California customer product merchant time area Doe VCR Sears 5-Feb-98 San Francisco Joe PC OfficeMax 7-Feb-98 San Francisco customer product merchant time area Doe TV Fry's 3-Jan-98 San Jose Smith Radio Kmart 14-Jan-98 San Jose Association   population      base          confidence      support cube               cube                cube         cube                cube LDOS LDOS GDOS 


the association condition, and the sets of customers contained in a 1 205, a k are not mutually disjoint. This can be seen in the following examples 214  A customer who bought A and B in both San Jose and San Francisco which are covered by different LDOSs , contributes a count to the rule covering each city, but has only one count, not two, for the rule A  336  B covering California 214  A customer \(e.g. Doe in Figure 3\who bought a TV in San Jose, but a VCR in San Francisco, is not countable for the cross-sale association rule TV  336 VCR covering any of these cities, but countable for the rule covering California. This is illustrated in Figure 3 6  Conclusions In order to scale-up association rule mining in ecommerce, we have developed a distributed and cooperative data-warehouse/OLAP infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to generate association rules with enhanced expressive power, by combining information of discrete commercial activities from different geographic areas, different merchants and over different time periods. In this paper we have introduced scoped association rules  association rules with conjoint items and functional association rules as useful extensions to association rules The proposed infrastructure has been designed and prototyped at HP Labs to support business intelligence applications in e-commerce. Our preliminary results validate the scalability and maintainability of this infrastructure, and the power of the enhanced multilevel and multidimensional association rules. In this paper we did not discuss privacy control in customer profiling However, we did address this issue in our design by incorporating support for the P3P protocol [1 i n  ou r data warehouse. We plan to integrate this framework with a commercial e-commerce system References 1  Sameet Agarwal, Rakesh Agrawal, Prasad Deshpande Ashish Gupta, Jeffrey F.
