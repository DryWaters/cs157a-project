  Fuzzy-based Methods for Privacy-Preserving Data Mining   R. Mukkamala V.G. Ashok Department of Computer Science, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA    Abstract As more and more organizations are collecting and sharing data about their customers, there is a growing concern about violation of customer privacy. While some of the sharing is for the benefit of general public such as to understand disease behavior in medical research individuals are concerned about violation of their privacy. The middle ground is found through privacy 
preserving data mapping. Here, sensitive attributes of data are mapped to another domain so that original values are not revealed and yet the original associations are retained. In this paper, we compare a set of fuzzybased mapping techniques in terms of their privacypreserving property and their ability to retain the same relationship with other fields. In particular, our contribution is on four fronts: \(i\ modification of the fuzzy function definition; \(ii\ introducing seven ways to combine the different functional values for a data item into a single value; \(iii\ using several similarity metrics to compare the original data with the mapped data; \(iv 
measuring the effect of mapping on derived association rule. The paper presents preliminary results in this direction and proposes future work in this area  Key Words association rules, data correlation, data mapping, sensitive data, similarity measures   1. Introduction  With the increased data collection and data analysis activity in all aspects of life, there is a fear of losing individual privacy m port a n t l y   organizations are increasingly collaborating to collectively analyze the data that they have collected 
Even in such collaborations, individual member organizations are cautious about sharing sensitive attributes of their data with others. One alternate is to map sensitive attributes of data to another domain such that its relationship with other attributes remains unaltered \(e.g association with other non-sensitive attributes\ and providing the altered data for sharing [1 r ex a m p l e  when U.S. Census Bureau periodically collects data from the public, it provides privacy by only asking users for a range \(e.g., salary range\her than specific salary. This 
also encourages individuals to provide such information 9, 10, 11  However, there are other situations where the data collector \(e.g., hospitals, insurance companies, credit card companies, etc.\ave the exact data about their clients but they cannot share some of the data attributes \(e.g., social security number, date of birth, etc.\e to their own privacy policies or privacy polices enforced by a Federal agency \(e.g., HIPAA, FERPA\. However, such sharing may benefit to identify underlying problems or relationships among a problem and the associated attributes of an individual with those problems. For 
example, if certain population is suffering from severe depression, then the underlying causes could be found by identifying attributes that they all share. These attributes could be maintained by individual organizations that may consider them as private In such cases, one of the solutions that has been suggested is to perturb or map the data [1 h ile s u c h  mapping should not enable the receiving party to derive the original values from the mapped values, they should also be able to retain the same association with other attributes as the original data. Such challenges also 
frequently arise when a data owner decides to offload the data mining activity to a third party such as a cloud operator. Here, the data owner needs to provide data to the cloud operator with a risk of losing privacy over the sensitive data. So, it is best for the data owner to transform the sensitive fields and provide the modified data to the cloud operator. However, there should be a straight forward and computationally simple means for the data owner to map the association rules derived from the modified data to those that apply to original data 
In summary, the problem of privacy-preserving data mining deals with two conflicting issues during the mapping: \(i\mapping should not reveal the original data value \(ii\ped fields should retain their original relationship with other attributes Several approaches have been suggested for this mapping In particu l ar, recen tl y  fu zz y mapping has been suggested to preserve privacy [5, 6  Here, the sensitive value range is partitioned into different segments and a function is defined on each segment.

this way, a given data value may be mapped to different values depending on which of these functions are applicable to it. From these values, the authors randomly pick a value In this paper, we expand on their work [5, 6 by  proposing different means to combine these functions instead of randomly picking up one of the values. We determine the efficacy of each of the combining functions based on their correlation between the original data and the final mapped values The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide a brief overview of the previous work. Section 3 describes our extension to the previous work. Section 4 summarizes some results from the extended functions Finally, section 5 summarizes the contribution of the paper and explains scope for future work  2. Previous work  One of the earliest work in the privacy-preserving data mining is by Agrawal and Srik e au t h ors investigate how different privacy preserving perturbations affect the association rules. In particular, they investigate how the original data distribution can be estimated based on the perturbed data. They have considered three types of perturbation: Value class membership where every data value corresponding to a class \(e.g., bin in a histogram\ is assigned the same value. They also look into value distortion where data is perturbed by a random number They determined that such random perturbation with Gaussian distribution is most effective. The random perturbation idea was further explored by Kargupta et al  T h ey obs erv e t h at random pert u r bat i ons do n o t  necessarily preserve data privacy.  Clifton et al summarize different techniques for privacy preserving  o m e h i gh l e v el te ch n i q u es are s u g g e s t ed f o r  solving the problem. In a more limited context of encrypted data mining, Singh et al suggest the use of Jaccard similarity function to derive relationships between attributes [4 Our work mainly concentrates on three recent papers  H e re, t h e au t h o r s propos e a f u zz y bas e d  mapping to map sensitive numerical data to another domain for privacy-preservation. Similarly, they propose a decision-tree based approach for mapping categorical data values. In this paper, we concentrate on the numerical data and fuzzy-based mapping Let us take a brief look at their method. If the sensitive field values are in the range min-max, then this range is divided into k fuzzy sets. Each data value is mapped into one of these five fuzzy sets. In order to distinguish one value of the set from another, a numerical affinity \(they refer to it as intensity\ term is used. In other words numerical data is mapped into different fuzzy sets, yet retaining their value in terms of an affinity value.  In order to show the efficacy of their mapping, they compute a correlation coefficient that relates the original value to the fuzzy set and the intensity. Their mapping functions are defined as follows  f 1 x 0.99   if x=min m 2 m 2 min if min < x < m 2 0.0   if x 000 m 2  f i x\ = 0.0   if x 000 m i-1  x-m i-1 m i m i-1 f m i-1 x < m i  0.99   if x=m i  m i+1 m i+1 m i f m i x < m i+1  0.0   if x 000 m i+1   f k x\ = 0.0   if x 000 m k-1  x-m k-1 max-m k-1 f m k-1 x < max  0.99   if x = max  Here, k is the number of fuzzy sets, min and max are the minimum and maximum values of x, respectively, and m 1 m 2 m k are the mid points of the k fuzzy sets. In other words, \(min…m 1 m 2 fuzzy set 1 m 1 m 2 m 3 s fuzzy set 2, …, \(m k-1 m k max\ is fuzzy set k. Each function determines the affinity of a data value to each fuzzy set. Based on the above definition, it is clear that a data value may belong to one or more fuzzy sets To be more specific, let us take an example set of data values in the range \(0 to 100\with k = 3.  Here, min=0 max=100, m 1 25, , m 2 50, and , m 4 75. So \(0..50\ is fuzzy set 1, \(25..75\uzzy set 2, and \(50..100\uzzy set3 with mid points of 25, 50, and 75, respectively. If we consider x=5, it is clearly in fuzzy set 1. As per the above mapping f 1 5\50 or 0.9. However, x = 45 falls in two fuzzy sets 1 and 2. Here, f 1 45\50 or 0.1 and f 2 x\25 or 0.8.  Further, to distinguish elements in one fuzzy set with another, the authors add the corresponding fuzzy set number to the affinity value. For example, for x=5, the mapped value will be 1+ f 1 5\imilarly x=45 may be mapped to either 1.1 or 2.8. The authors do not state whether the choice between these is random, the highest, the lowest, or the average In order to ensure that the mapping does not lose the relationship of this mapped sensitive attribute with other attributes, the authors comp ute a correlation coefficient between the original data and the mapped value However, they do not investigate the degree of privacy offered by the resulting mapping In this paper, we extend this work by modifying the mapping function. We also propose several methods to determine the final mapped value when a data value belongs to different fuzzy sets.  In addition, we compare these methods in terms of the resulting association rules they produce and the similarity between the original data and the mapped data, in each case

3. Proposed mapping  When we look at the above function, it may be observed that when values lie in the min-m 1 or m k max they are mapped to only one fuzzy function. Yet, the above mapping function maps them to different affinity values. In some sense, affinity is a proxy to the probability with which a data value is likely to belong to a fuzzy set. So if a data value belongs only to one fuzzy set its affinity to that set should be 1.0. If we assume that the range of each fuzzy set is equal \(i.e., m 1 min = m 2 m 1  max-m k m i+1 m i then we may observe that the total affinity being 1 is valid for all ranges of x except the ones in 0..m 1 and m k max, where k is the number of fuzzy functions. To rectify this deficiency, we suggest the following mapping function  f 1 x 1.0   if min 000 x < m 1 m 2 m 2 m 1  if m 1  000 x < m 2 0.0   if x 000 m 2  f i x\ = 0.0   if x 000 m i-1  x-m i-1 m i m i-1 f m i-1 x < m i  1.0   if x=m i  m i+1 m i+1 m i f m i x < m i+1  0.0   if x 000 m i+1   f k x\ = 0.0   if x 000 m k-1  x-m k-1 m k m k-1 f m k-1 x < m k 1.0   if m k  000 x 000 max  The new function overcomes the deficiency of the earlier method These functions basically assume equal-sized ranges However, this may not always be feasible. To see the need for non-uniform ranges, we need to go back to the basis on which the ranges of fuzzy functions have been defined in the first place. Suppose a data owner has run association rules on the original data and found that the ranges of interest for x are: 0-20, 10-40, 20-60, and 80100. For example, it was found that persons in the age 020 and in the range 80-100 are more prone to accidents similarly, persons in the range 10-40 are more prone to depression; and persons in the age 20-60 are more prone to ocular disease. In this case, it makes logical sense to define the fuzzy functions in line with the ones identified by the association rules. Accordingly, in this example, we could define four fuzzy functions as follows: f 1  000  0,1.0 2 10,40 000 0,1.0 3 20,60 000 0,1.0 4 80,1 000 0,1.0   T he  m i d p o i nt s o f t he s e fo ur  fu nc t i o ns a r e  m 1 10, m 2 25, m 3 40, and m 4 90, respectively. Here, the fuzzy functions are defined independently depending on the underlying association rules. We should notice that the range of values 60-80 are not covered by any of the four functions. So we define a fifth fuzzy function f 5  000 0,1.0 i t h m 5 70.   In case, some of the x ranges are not covered by any of the defined ranges, then we need to define additional fuzzy functions to cover these ranges also. In this example, the fuzzy functions would be as follows  f 1 x\  = x/10   if 0 000 x < 10   20-x\/10  if 10 000 x < 20  0.0   if x 000 20  f 2 x x-10\15  if 10 000 x < 25   40-x\/15  if 25 000 x < 40  0.0   if x 000 40 f 3 x x-20\20  if 20 000 x < 40   60-x\/20  if 40 000 x < 60  0.0   if x 000 60 f 4 x x-80\10  if 80 000 x < 90   100-x\/10  if 90 000 x < 100  0.0   if x 000 100 f 5 x x-60\10  if 60 000 x < 70   80-x\/10  if 70 000 x < 80  0.0   if x 000 60  Of course, there are several variations of these. For example, we could replace the linear function used here with a non-linear mapping function. However, due to space limitation, we do not discuss these alternatives in this paper Having defined the fuzzy functions, the next step is to map the functions into appropriate values. Using the method in e ca n co nv ert each  fun c tion  v a l u e b y  adding a distinct integer for the affinity value. For example, if we consider x=15, f 1 x\d  f 2 x These values are represented as 1.5 and 2.33, respectively by the previous work. The question now is how to convert this value into a single value. Since earlier work did not suggest any particular method for combining these two functions into a single mapped value, we suggest the following seven methods  i Arithmetic average Take the average of the different values. In the above example, the mapped value would be 1.5+2.33\ or 1.915 ii Normalized average If we consider the affinity as a probability, then we should first normalize the affinity values so that they sum to 1.0. In this case, 0.5 and 0.33 will be normalized to 0.5/0.83 and 0.33/0.83 or 0.60 and 0.40, respectively. We can now take the weighted average 1.60*0.6+2.4*0.4\r 2.0 iii Weighted average Take weighted average of different values. For example, in the example, take weighted average of 1.5 \(with a weight of 0.5\d 2.33 weight of 0.33\. This will be \(1.5*0.5+2.33*0.33\/0.83 or 1.83 iv Higher affinity value Take the value with higher affinity. In the example it would be 1.5 v Random pick Randomly pick one of the values. In the example, it would be either 1.5 or 2.33. But this seems 
350 


like the least desirable alternative vi Maximum value Pick the maximum value. For example, between 1.5 and 2.33, pick 2.33 vii Minimum value Pick the minimum value. In the above example, pick 1.5  Another important extension that we propose is the metrics by which the relationship between the original data and the mapped data are compared. The earlier authors suggested correlation coefficient as a method. But we extend it by proposing the use of other similarity measures particu l ar  w e c h oos e t h e f o llo w i ng measures, in addition to the correlation coefficient. First we define the following  a 015Ì\022:\0072 013Ü\000\003 005Û\000\003\0073 013Ü\000\003\000\003 013 013Ü\013@\0135 022  b 015Ì\022:\0072 013 005Û\000\003\0072 013Ü\000\003\000\003 013 013Ü\013@\0135 022  c 015Ì\022:\0073 013Ü\000\003 005Û\0073 013Ü\000\003\000\003 013 013Ü\013@\0135 022  d 003 0072 013Ü\000\003 013 013Ü\013@\0135  e 003 000\003\0073 013Ü\000\003\000\003 013 013Ü\013@\0135    Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0074\015L\000\003 013_\013?\022:\013b\005Û\013c\022;\002\000\013l 013q\013o\013p\013r\022@\013`\013?\013b\005 014Z 014d 022A\005Û\013q\013o\013p\013r\022:\013a\013?\013c\005 014 014d 022 1 Jaccard similarity measure 007,\015L 013_ 013`\013>\013a\013?\013_ 2 Dice similarity measure 007&\015L 0136\013_ 013`\013>\013a  3  Cosine similarity measure 007%\000\003 015L 013_ 013q\013o\013p\013r\022:\013`\005Û\013a\022 4  4. Results  In order to check the efficacy of the proposed mapping, we have evaluated the methods using several data sets available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository \(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml Since the previous paper have chosen the Adult set http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult\ith 32561 instances, we start with this set We have conducted two types of tests to evaluate the effect of mapping on data mining. First, we have computed the similarity of the original data to the mapped data. For this we have used the four similarity measures mentioned above. Second, we have compared the association rules derived from the mapped data with the ones derived from the original data. In the following, we summarize our results  4.1. Similarity measures  In order to compare the similarity of the original data with the mapped data, we have used the four metrics defined in \(1\\(4\ we summarize the results for the 7 mappings First, consider the correlation coefficient measure with the original mapping suggested by the authors as well as the ones derived by our mapping. We have evaluated the correlation with all seven combining methods.. We consider three function with ranges: f 1 ranging from 0-50 f 2 ranging from 25-75, and f 3 ranging from 50-100 with mid points as 25, 50, and 75 respectively.  The results are summarized in Table 1. Row R1 represents the correlation coefficient with earlier mapping o w R 2 repres en t s  results with our mapping. It should be noted that the two mappings defer in the regions 0-50 \(due to f 1 d 50-100 due to f 3 Not surprisingly, the minimum value choice M7\d the random choice \(M5\ have the lowest correlation coefficients in both mappings. In addition, it may be observed that correlation with our mapping is smaller than that of the earlier ma h en  w e are  attempting to hide the data from the data miner for privacy purposes, it is best to have small correlations between the original and the mapped data. So we claim that the privacy offered by our mapping is better than the earlier scheme m a y  als o be obs erv e d th at the  maximum choice \(M6\ has the highest correlation and hence won’t be so suitable for preserving privacy Let us now look at other similarity measures--- Jaccard similarity \(J\imilarity \(D\d Cosine similarity C\hese are summarized below. Interestingly, all the proposed similarity measures show results similar to the correlation coefficient measure. However, the variation is not as distinct as the correlation. This means that we need to do further investigations to determine the right similarity measures for this mapping   M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 R1 0.88 0.89 0.94 0.84 0.61 0.97 0.56 R2 0.73 0.90 0.81 0.75 0.54 0.94 0.21 J1 0.05 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.05 0.07 0.04 J2 0.06 0.05 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.07 0.05 D1 0.10 0.11 0.11 0.11 0.10 0.12 0.08 D2 0.11 0.10 0.11 0.11 0.11 0.12 0.09 C1 0.96 0.99 0.99 0.98 0.96 0.99 0.95 C2 0.97 0.98 0.98 0.98 0.95 0.99 0.93 Table 1. Similarity of mapped data with original data computed with original and proposed mappings  In the current case, the original ranges values of age range from 1-100 while the mapped ones range from 1-4 Thus, in computing the similarity measures, using \(1\-\(4 the P values \(original values\ will be much higher than the Q values \(mapped values\o ensure that both are in the same range, we normalize them and recomputed the measures. The metrics for the normalized values are shown in Table 2. These are prefixed with N to indicate that they are derived from normalized values. Obviously 
351 


the correlation coefficient is unaltered with the normalization. But there is a significant difference in the values of other metrics. But the overall relative difference among the measures remains the same as before. We are currently investigating this aspect and attempting to determine which normalization helps us better understand the similarity  M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 NR1 0.88 0.89 0.94 0.84 0.61 0.97 0.56 NR2 0.73 0.90 0.81 0.75 0.54 0.94 0.21 NJ1 0.95 0.97 0.97 0.92 0.81 0.94 0.63 ND1 0.98 0.98 0.99 0.96 0.89 0.97 0.77 NC1 0.98 0.98 0.99 0.96 0.90 0.996 0.81 NJ2 0.89 0.76 0.78 0.94 0.92 0.81 0.99 ND2 0.94 0.86 0.88 0.97 0.96 0.90 0.997 NC2 0.97 0.90 0.92 0.99 0.97  0.91 0.998 Table 2. Similarity measures with normalized values for both original and mapped data  4.2. Effect on derived association rules  One of the primary motivations for doing the suggested mapping is to hide sensitive attribute information from the data miner. To be more specific, let us take a scenario where the data owner collects data \(e.g., credit card company\ and intends to derive association rules by data mining the data. Due to lack of expertise and computational resources, the data owner outsources the data to an outside agency \(e.g., cloud operator\. However to protect the privacy of the sensitive attributes \(e.g., Age in Adult data set\ose attributes are mapped to another domain. When the data miner receives the modified data it derives association rules \(for example\ponding to the presented data and returns them to the data owner The data owner now remaps the mapped sensitive attributes in the association rules back to the original domain. This process is illustrated in Figure 1. Only the remapped rules are meaningful to the data owner However, the main question that arises is: how accurate are the remapped association rules? In other words, did the mapping affect the semantics of the association rule mining? If so, to what degree? This is another measure of success of the privacy-preserving mapping. Here, we summarize the results we obtained with adult data set considered above        Figure 1. Privacy preserving data mining process For simplicity, we continue to consider age alone as the sensitive attribute. Suppose we have picked the random choice for mapping. Then, the association rules derived from the adult data set using Weka h o w n i n  Figure 2. Each rule has LHS and RHS. It also specifies how many records satisfy LHS \(i.e., support\ and how many satisfy both LHS and RHS. The number of RHS/number on LHS is referred to as the confidence That is also shown for each rule. The sets only shows those rules involving the age attribute \(e.g., 9, 12, etc                                            Figure 2.

Now, suppose the data owner is provided with these rules he needs to map them back to the original domain for age attribute. Since the data owner knows both the original values and the mapped values, the conversion should not be difficult. For example, when we select one particular rule, say age='\(1.77055-2.513 edu cat i o n  S o m e c ol l e g e 5098 native-country=United-States 4685    conf:\(0.92  This can be mapped to the original domain as age={17-71} education=Some-college  ==> nativecountry=United-States Table 3summarizes the results with the seven mappings  Sl# Type Age LHS RHS RHS LHS 1 Original data 17-37.5 4275 3905 0.91 2a Arithmetic mean 2 6453 5949 0.92 2b 17-53 6453 5949 0.92 3a Normalized  1.5 3934 3590 0.91 3b 17-35 3934 3590 0.91 4a Weighted average 1.8752.406 6074 5598 0.92 4b 17-49 6074 5598 0.92 5a Higher affinity 1.5212.140 5428 4992 0.92 5b 17-44 5428 4992 0.92 6a Random 1.7712.514 5098 4685 0.92 6b 17-71 7221 6673 0.924 7a Maximum 2-2.5 5428 4992 0.92 7b 17-44 5428 4992 0.92 7a Minimum  1.7712.514 4815 4413 0.924 7b 17-71 7221 6673 0.924 Table 3.

Conclusion and Future work  Privacy-preserving data mining has become an important issue in today’s highly information analysis based research and marketing. This is an issue not only when data mining needs data mining requires data from different organizations \(sources\t also when data mining is delegated to a third-party such as a cloud operator. While much work is done in terms of Kanonymity di v e rsi t y 10], an d t cl os en e s s 11 While the initial work in this area started with data perturbation, the fuzzy-mapping approach is reasonably new [5,6,7 In th is p a p e r w e h a v e e x p a n d ed th eir i n itia l  work in three fronts: \(i\ied the fuzzy function definition; \(ii\ introduced seven ways to combine the different functional values for a data item into a single value; \(iii\sed several similarity metrics to compare the original data with the mapped data.

Members endowments Familys endowments Attitude of families to IT Attitude of neighbours to IT Adoption attention Fig.1.Information technology adoption model based on farmers endowments From the results above, age, education, family income family communication cost and job type affect farmers capacity of information technology adoption. Moreover perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude of neighbors to techniques affect farmers intention. Therefore the data mining of association rules behind will use these 9 factors to study farmers endowments impact on information technology adoption behavior and their adoption mode C. Mode of farmers information technology adoption based on association rules 1 Association rules are to look for the relationship among different variables in the database, and find out the frequent mode [11 Definition 1: Let   be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let transaction T be a subset of I i.e. I?T . Let  be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID. Let A be an itemset, and transaction T contains A, i.e. TA Definition 2: A rule is defined as an implication of the form BA? ?where IA ? , IB ? ,and ??BA ? . The sets of items A and B are called antecedent \(left-hand-side or LHS and consequent \(right-hand-side or RHS respectively Definition 3 : When BA?  is a rule in database D, it has to satisfy the minimum support S and minimum confidence C Support is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contains the itemset, i.e BAPS Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability  ABP Association rules generation is usually split up into two 


separate steps Step 1: minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database Step 2: these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules 2 In 1994, Agrawal with other scholars worked out Apriori algorithm. The core principle is that the subsets of a frequent itemset are still frequent itemsets and the supersets of an unfrequent itemset are still unfrequent. Moreover, Apriori is a kind of iterative algorithm which is based on a two-stage mining thought for frequent itemsets. In detail, Apriori uses a bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time \(a step known as candidate generation groups of candidates are tested against the data. From L1 to Lk the algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. But one attention of Apriori is that when searching for frequent subset Lk from Lk-1, connection and pruning will be done in the process. And finally association rules will result from the frequent itemsets[12 3 With software Weka3.5.8, some association rules between three information techniques \(call centre, SMS and network platform under the condition of probability=0.5, confidence=0.4 Therefore, some strong association rules with high confidence have been listed typically in Table.2 TABLE II.

SMS = yes a technique while job=farmer, family communication channels middle, family communication cost = middle and family income =middle. The association rules reflect weak relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation. However farmers are still afraid of getting fake information b technique while age = young, job = planting, breeding and selling production, family income = high and public communication channels = wide. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers job, age and family income. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, this technique costs much c 


while age=young, education=high, family communication cost=middle and family income=high. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, farmers are still worried about the attitude of neighbors around to their behavior 4.CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION From the mining results, we bring forward following conclusions A. Build various communication channels and provide differentiation information technology Farmers who have few communication channels dont want to adopt new techniques because of their limited family economic ability. We suggest government should try to reduce the risk and cost of technique adoption, promote various communication channels with different charging standards or provide some benefits of different degrees B.  Intensify farmers education and improve farmers certification of techniques Government should undertake some temporary training courses to instruct farmers some new information technologies for rural areas and let farmers be acquaint with these techniques. In this way, first farmers certification and then the information technology adoption rate will be improved C. Reduce technique cost and improve service quality It will do well in the technique promotion when the technique charging is lower and techniques are more various Moreover, considering that the service quality will influence farmers technology adoption intention and behavior information service institutions should try to perfect the quality through better satisfying farmers information demands and more reducing service cost. In this way, farmers information technology adoption will be promoted ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper is sponsored by Beijing forestry university Scientific and Technological Innovation Project BLRW200922 REFERENCES 1] Artesyn technologies: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Phone Covered 99.8% of Administrative Villages While Broadband Covered 96% of Villages and Towns. 3      December  2009. 20 June

Our literature survey discovered an association between them such that rs256871 SNP is part of SEPT8 gene, and, in turn the SEPT8 gene is known to be accountable for tuberculosis among Asians [12 Nonetheless, most of the rules found in this study were difficult to interpret, because, out of more than 660,000 SNPs used in the study, very small numbers of such SNPs had been subject to research for  3 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218008T 4 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218014Q 322 determining the relations with particular traits such as population and geographical region.

Rules extracted from the third experiment where the associations between SNP genotypes and geographical regions are identified The M and m refer to major and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively  6. Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
