The Curious Identity of Michael Field and its Implications for Humanities Research with the Semantic Web Susan Brown University of Alberta  University of Guelph Implementing the New Knowledge Environment Text Mining  Visualization for Literary History Edmonton Canada susan.brown@uoguelph.ca John Simpson University of Alberta Implementing the New Knowledge Environment Text Mining  Visualization for Literary History Edmonton Canada john.simpson@ualberta.ca Abstract This paper uses the case of author Michael Field the shared writing identity of two late Victorian women to consider the implications of embracing the semantic web for humanities research It is argued that the ontologies prevalent today reveal a lack of nuance when it comes to the complex relationships that are the focus of much humanities research such as the connection of names to persons particularly with respect to authorship Further the current state of ontology use aside even the sophisticated use of OWL SKOS or ontology alignment techniques for linking big semantic web collections stands to hinder humanities research by hiding rather than exposing difference We use the outlier Michael Field to highlight what much of the valuable work of the humanities is about and in doing so bring to the fore the challenge of formalizing complex social meanings that can otherwise be overlooked or dismissed as a trivial technicality As a solution the humanities community is encouraged to begin engaging more directly in the construction of semantic web tools and infrastructure Keywords ontologies semantic web humanities Michael Field pseudonyms I H UMANITIES S CHOLARSHIP AND THE S EMANTIC W EB Humanities scholars have long recognized the potential of linking datasets to allow illumination of subject areas via computer-based analysis and for providing new forms of access to the vast array of texts and other materials where much of our intellectual and cultural history resides While the majority of primary and secondary material collections in digital form remain effectively siloed immense strides have been made towards freeing these over the past few years enabling us to begin investigating the kinds of humanistic phenomena that appear only at scale The path to the current state of affairs began with coining semantic web in 2001 and since then the number of data sources available in formats suitable for linked open data has increased exponentially In 2007 there were just 12 data sets published as linked open data but by 2011 this number had increased to 295 As of writing August 2013 the CKAN data hub currently boasts 6,136 data sets meant to be connected and shared After a period of caution we are now witnessing a decided increase in the uptake of linked open data standards and semantic web technologies for humanities research This uptake is expressed in three sorts of contributions aggregations of humanities relevant information specialty topic explorations and tools 7 Aggregator projects collect together massive amounts of information providing a one-stop-shop of sorts for information attached to a particular theme or topic They archive a wide range of historical materials for aggregation and discovery such as Europeana or PELAGIOS or provide a more focused but no less extensive collection of materials by type or theme such as is done by NINES There also exist much smaller projects that stand out because of the special attention that is given to curating the information that they hold What they lack in breadth they attempt to make up for with depth and/or prototyping alternative ways to interact with the information they present Linked Jazz and InPhOare exemplars of this sort of humanities contribution to linked data and the semantic web More generalized tools are also being built to allow humanists to contribute to interact with and contribute to semantic web materials including Pundit SharedCanvas AustESE and CWRC-Writer These tools have all been developed in relation to humanities or memory institution projects These sorts of projects unify like-minded communities reîecting the premises of the semantic web  Semantic W e b i s b uilt up from small like-minded communities that can nd agreement on terms amongst themselves Applications then can and do interact without attempting to achieve global consensus There is no requirement for global ontologies instead an application need only map the terms relevant for a particular transaction into a common vocabulary Of course though agreement need only be local adoption of existing vocabularies facilitates data sharing and integration 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE 


What humanists ultimately want from the semantic web is not only access to all material and only that material of interest to a particular inquiry but also the ability to extract from the massive aggregation of separate datasets new leads connections or insights That is they subscribe to the hope that it will be possible to use the semantic content and structures of semantic web data to produce knowledge that could not be arrived at by other means To address these demands requires a balancing act between collecting as much as we can and ignoring what is not of interest between errors of admission and errors of omission and between taking too much and taking too little Currently we are erring on the side of taking too much as we gather together masses of information in the twin hopes that we can sort out what is of value later and that the aggregation itself will produce information of value Such are the drives of the big data movement Within this context we consider how the development of the semantic web is shaping up for the humanities Much of what is offered here emerges from work being done to connect a signiìcant humanities datastore with the semantic web The datastoreÑpublished as Orlando Womenês Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present  is a born-digital reference and research resource comprised of more than 1,300 detailed biocritical entries capturing over 27,000 individual people plus extensive historical and bibliographical detail 8 The prose within each entry has been marked up using XML to identify information related to authors lives and writing careers contextual material timelines sets of internal links and bibliographies  W ith the inte gration of the Orlando Project data with the semantic web as the background for this inquiry we rst summarize one major shortcoming of current approaches to building humanist data stores for connectivity to either the linked data cloud or the semantic web After brieîy outlining the particular importance of naming and the representation of identities we then provide the speciìc example of the late Victorian writer Michael Field exploring the challenges it poses to the treatment of personal identity within a semantic web context We argue that even the most sophisticated use of ontologies like OWL or SKOS or the use of ontology alignment techniques will not allow linked data and the semantic web to meet some fundamental requirements of humanities researchers The current approach to the semantic web with its background assumptions and practical implementations actually runs counter to the achievement of our long-term goals This problem can be solved at least in part we argue if humanities researchers revise both our expectations and the direction of the development of data repositories inference engines and ontology standards II T HE E ROSION OF D IFFERENCE T HROUGH A GGREGATION Granting that linked open data and the semantic web are both still in their relative infancy or just past what the Gartner Group refers to as the peak of inîated expectations  37 there are still elements about the current state of affairs and its future tendencies that are of concern to humanists Indeed both the potential and the shortcomings of existing large data sets for much humanities research have received much attention particularly as manifest in the concepts of distant reading and culturenomics  38 While there are man y challenges to inte grating humanities data with the semantic web the focus here is on the erosion of markers of difference through aggregation Humanists research diverse aspects of human culture and cultural processes on both large and small scales with a particular emphasis on the relationship of cultural processes and products to their connections with human agents To the extent that RDF is built to work with and through machineprocessable ontologies the implications for knowledge representation and knowledge construction are massive and are a major source of the attraction to linked data frameworks For the humanities the move to linked open data and the semantic web is potentially paradigm-shifting presenting a tantalizing prospect of the opportunity to access investigate and make sense of human culture on an unprecedented scale The exibility of linked data technology lies in the fact that each datastore can be given its own vocabulary and ontology to suit its needs and link out to other datastores as desired at least in principle  However linking up datastores often means connecting different vocabularies and ontologies This in turn brings with it a pressure towards generalization rather than speciìcity because of the deep complexities involved in both generating and aligning ontologies of any non-trivial sophistication While there are sophisticated ontologies being developed and implemented for speciìc domains and projects the norm by far for most semantic web projects including humanities ones is to cherry-pick terms from existing ontologies that strike them as generally useful for cobbling together their own vocabulary 46 In the actual implementations of most semantic web datastores and aggregators precision and richness are often foregone in favour of matching up with widely-used ontologies This translates into generalization and loss of speciìcity making the aggregated data less useful for humanities inquiry than it might otherwise be Dominic Oldman of the British Museum eloquently summarizes the situation  y link ed data points lack the quality to be more than basic information jukeboxes that in turn support applications with limited usefulness and shelf life In short the current cultural heritage linked data movement concentrating on access a fundamental objective may have ignored some of 78 


reasons for establishing networks of knowledge in the rst place The rationale for linking data he implies includes not merely ease of access the low-hanging fruit enabled by the consolidation of datasets but the larger prize of seeing culture otherwise than we can with our current data and methods It is certainly true that a little semantics goes a long way b u t t o h a v e more than catalogues that erase the speciìcs of difference in the interests of aggregation we need a little bit more than a little semantics Difference as in distinctions of particularity speciìcity and locality of meaning provides us with the ability to make sense of the complexities of human records and human lives Difference also means difference from the norm the marginalization and anomalousness associated with categories such as race gender or nation are registers of difference Difference is key to understanding how literature culture and ideas develop The semantic web as a tool for connecting and representing human knowledge and understanding on a massive scale is poised to either promote or hide difference and differences in approach matter Consider a couple of the most widely used ontologies FOAF the Friend of a Friend ontology that was originally intended as a supplement/alternative to social networking websites describes what constitutes a person thus The Person class represents people Something is a Person if it is a person We donêt nitpic about whether theyêre alive dead real or imaginary The Person class is a sub-class of the Agent class since all people are considered agents in FOAF This no nitpicking approach ensures that the ontology is exible enough to appeal to many users by covering all possible understandings of personhood A similar move towards broad generalization is made in the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative an ontology directed to w ards capturing the relationships that persons have to the things that they create Here there are only two roles which can be assigned to a person they must either be a creator or a contributor DCMI does this to maximize its applicability to a wide range of works and to simplify the application of these properties to the persons involved There is no need to decide if a person is an artist or an author or an architect they are all brought together under one or the other of these two terms Clearly neither of these two highly generalized approaches reîects the kind of differences routinely recognized by humanists in the course of scholarly inquiry If we presume that such distinctions are fundamental to humanist work it is clear that the mountains of data we are amassing using such ontologies will support only very limited types of inquiry or inference III W HAT  SINANAME  Names are important because the act of naming allows us to differentiate the particular from the general in our thoughts and ideas Names thus produce affordances with which we are able to separate capture and manipulate tokens from a sea of types As Hope Olson argues in her critical study of library subject representation Naming is the act of bestowing a name of labelling of creating an identity Indeed much of the po wer of the semantic web comes from the ability to name entities and to link materials across disparate sources Olsonês observation of naming as an act of identity creation suggests an important bridge between naming and personhood through the concept of identity In many instances naming is a foundational act of creating persons speciìcally because it provides an identity where there previously was none a simultaneous creation of an individual and an extension of the group bestowing the name At times this act of naming leads the way to personiìcations that challenge our understanding of personhood in complex ways consider how the naming of both corporations and stuffed animals leads us to lean towards treating them both as persons in potentially controversial ways Our concern here is that personhood is both a complex and a crucial characteristic that ontologies must be designed to capture appropriately lest some of our understandings of the world fail to be addressed What is at stake in such designs is the ability of the resulting ontology to capture adequately not just the nuances of a relationship between persons organizations objects and other such things but for these relationships to be captured in ways that are even broadly correct As a trivial example consider an ontology that merged FOAF and the DCMI a reasonable assumption since these are two of the most popular ontologies In doing so an ontology designer would be left with only two roles in the DCMI to equate to the people captured in FOAF they could be either a dc:contributor or dc:creator Regardless of how this combination is pitched it amounts to a attening out of relationships that makes detailed inquiry into authorship and reception an extremely difìcult prospect This attening is not so much a matter of mistaken ontology combination as it is poor ontology selection For poor ontology combination in action let us consider the case of Michael Field IV M ICHAEL F IELD Humanists have been at work for more than two decades since the days of the earliest graphical browsers to populate the web with more diverse content about women writers A major aim of the Orlando Project for instance was speciìcally to increase the representation of women both on the web and in literary history This concern goes beyond academia the Rewriting Wikipedia Project initiated in May 2013 tackled the well-known gender gap in the most commonly used encyclopedia in the world particularly with respect to women from marginalized groups 20 So there remains a strong impetus to attempt to rectify the 79 


omissions and biases of history and of mainstream culture by promoting knowledge of womenês achievements Women also constitute a particularly good class of people through which to consider relationships between names and identities given that the institutionalization of womenês name changes through marriage in many Western countries means that an individual woman often uses several names over the course of a lifetime This makes it hard to connect all the different names to the same historical individual presenting a long-standing problem with respect to library cataloguing census research and other indexing systems Women writers present an even better test case for testing the ability of semantic web representations to handle complex relationships between names and identities Virginia Woolf remarked in 1928 I would venture to guess that Anon who wrote so many poems without signing them was often a woman 45 and considered it an indication of the extent to which writing has been fraught for women in Western European culture Much inquiry into the gendering of the eld of literary production and reception has focused on the extent of the reasons underlying and the impact of the adoption of anonymity and pseudonymity by female authors 34 16 30 The author Michael Field was the product of an artistic collaboration between Katherine Harris Bradley and Edith Emma Cooper during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Bradley and Cooper are marginalized and outliers in several ways An aunt and niece by marriage they were avowed lovers in a historical period in which lesbianism even less than homosexuality was without a public name or identity They represent an unusual type of authorship having written together under the name and the shared identity of Michael Field after rst publishing under the dual pseudonyms of Arran and Isla Leigh These tw o biological and historical entities operated as a single author but they carried their shared pseudonym also over into their private life in which Katherine was Michael and Edith variously Field Henry Hennery Henny or Hennie-boy Then there is their relationship to the name of Sappho the ancient Greek poet at the head of the lyric tradition of Western poetry whose name was becoming a rallying point for an emergent lesbian subculture Sappho s remaining fragmentary texts a potent example of the extent to which humanities data can never be complete were literally incorporated into the lyric poems of the Michael Fieldês Long Ago in such a way that as Yopie Prins argues Bradley and Cooper appropriate Sappho as a name simultaneously proper and improper their own and not their own Fieldês name is thus layered and complex in its relationship to historical personhood in addition to Bradley and Cooper there is also Sappho about whom so little is known that she is almost as much of a construction as Michael Field and the familiar variants of the pseudonym used by the two women in everyday life The properties of Field are equally complex in relation to both gender and number Holly Laird uses a female pronoun while Lisa Prins  and Orlando  use the third-person plural and yet the name was clearly chosen by the women as a singular masculine authorial identity invoked as him Male pseudonyms adopted by women are interestingly bisexual in that they carry in their motivations traces of the socialized femininity of the author even as they publicly perform masculinity The singularity of the pseudonym however might equally also be applied to the female union of Bradley and Cooper who considered themselves married As Lorraine Y ork notes this pronomially irregular relationship led Robert Browning to send via a mutual friend of Field greetings to both of him A unifying vie w i s manifestly wrong So too is a divisional view And like much of humanities research saying that the truth is somewhere in between is of no help at all As Laird comments Field in fact anticipates the feminist historicizing scholar the scholar who seeks representations of women and gender in the fracturing mirror of past texts in order to put the fragments together in her own documents  In other w ords to smooth out and create a uniìed identity from the differences embedded in the signature of Michael Field would be to miss the point of that signature and erase history Let us turn then to the view of Michael Field that we gain from existing linked data DBpedia is a Linked Data project based on structured information derived from Wikipedia entries 12 Looking at the DBpedia entry for Michael Field visualized as network graph in Figure 1 begins to reveal the sorts of problems that can arise in using RDF to describe such a complex entity Figure 1 DBpedia sends Michael Field to College In the representation provided in DBpedia Michael Field takes on interesting properties based both on what is said and on what is not said To begin Field is asserted to be identical with Bradley This makes it the case that any property that is attributed to her gets attributed to Field because OWL deìnes the sameAs relationship as satisfying the strongest identity claim possible DBpedia goes further  reaching outside itself and linking to Freebase another RDF 80 


based knowledge store Freebase asserts that Field went to Newnham College and is female Of course neither of these is true It was Bradley who went to NewnhamÑa full ten years before her collaboration with Cooper produced Field and Field is not female at least not female with the certainty asserted here by DBpedia/Freebase given the complexities outlined above Further based on the DBpedia representation a reasonable take-away would be that Field is the actual person and perhaps Bradley is the artistic creation But note that not even inverting these assertions makes things right because the DBpedia approach does not include the contributions of Cooper at all Even a scholarly literary resource dedicated to the history of difference has trouble capturing Field The scholars behind Orlando privileged the publishing persona that arose from the collaboration between Bradley and Cooper and therefore produced a lengthy entry on Michael Field rather than entries on each woman individually This entry is marked up with XML using the projectês bespoke schema However while the prose captures the complex nature of Field as an entity the XML does not As translated into RDF from the Orlando schema Field ends up being born twice and dying twice and is made out to be female when the intention behind the partnership was to allow the women to operate as male within the literary scene of the day So the RDF extracted from the entry is both factually inaccurate and impoverished The network graph captured in Figure 2 should make the limitations clear Figure 2 Orlando allows that Michael Field was born and died twice V I MPLICATIONS FOR THE H UMANITIES AND THE S EMANTIC W EB At this point it may seem that the problem here is that the wrong schemas and ontologies are being used or that there is no real issue here because Field is such an outlier that invoking himÑor herÑor themÑamounts to scholarly nitpicking Michael Field might also be seen as the sort of problem that can be solved by some alternative use of the tools at hand e.g not using owl:sameAs or some other simple/clever technical solution We urge caution against comfortably settling into any of these dismissive conclusions Not every problem that has arisen from this process is amenable to a technical solution The author Michael Field brings to the fore the extent to which the construction of ontologies poses a real challenge While Field could be shoehorned into existing ontologies as either a pseudonym or a corporate author we contend that neither is an adequate representation of the relationship even in combination Indeed Field has been pretty much shoehorned into the DBpedia ontology with the results outlined above Though it is in some respects highly unusual in other ways Fieldês case is far from unique Fuzziness with respect to the relationship between names and cultural creators entangles authorship and personhood in ways that result in confusion and outright error in numerous semantic web representations The case of Field is not a mistake that can be easily cleared up it is not as if someone has mislabeled a dog sh as a dog Rather the problems arise because the DBpedia Freebase and Orlando Project ontologies apply properties related to personhood in commonsensical and normalizing fashions that are inadequate for capturing the complexities of Field Field is in sum an entity who challenges the very concept of personhood We get by with our everyday understandings in life and in most Linked Data contexts because most cases do not give rise to the kinds of strangeness we see in the RDF representations of Field We could take the FOAF no nitpicking route and just let everything in but that avoids the problem Field is the ontological equivalent of approaching the speed of light a fringe case beyond everyday experience indicating that our common sense understandings and knowledge may not be as perfect as we treat them as being both within a semantic web context and elsewhere An adequate representation of the particular kind of personhood and authorship embedded in the signature of Michael Field seems to us impossible within the terms of existing bibliographical ontologies or other more general ontologies Nor is this a case of sloppy popular ontologies vs rigorous expert ontologies neither the widely employed FRBR Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records nor PRO Publishing Roles Ontology is a help in tackling this problem Even constructing a new ontology to account for the particular challenges posed by Field would only serve to address the symptom rather than the underlying cause the messiness hidden behind our everyday ontological assumptions Any nuance that might be built into a new ontology moreover would likely be obscured if that data were brought into use alongside other data sets since in that context it would likely be generalized to match up with the limited 81 


vocabulary of a more standard ontology such as Dublin Core An example of this kind of effect is that in the Virtual International Authority File VIAF a major resource comprised of the records of leading national libraries worldwide twenty-ìrst-century editor Sharon Bickle shows up as coauthor with Michael Field the Victorian author she edited  Sappho and composer Johann Strauss Jr are also listed as co-Authors This is not an insigniìcant problem on a small scale and if Swoogle is to be believed and there are really over 10,000 namespaces as part of the semantic web  the problem is an ything b u t small 1 Again it may be tempting to assert that this is merely a technical problem that can be solved by the appropriate use of an ontology like SKOS the clever use of OWL or even the creation of a new ontology custom built for the purpose of making such problems go away What such solutions really amount to are acts of ontology integration and while technically plausible in theory in practice they present signiìcant challenges that only well funded projects have the capacity to pursue Ontology integration is a well-known and growing problem on the semantic web for which there are no general solutions that come without costs The most robust of these solutions is what Pinto et al count as integration proper  This approach assembles a n e w purpose-b uilt ontology from the pieces of other ontologies The connective logic is worked out at each step and a new ontology results Understandably there is a great deal of work and reîection that needs to go into this process and so this approach is not undertaken lightly if accuracy is even remotely important A second approach discussed by Pinto et al is merging Here existing ontologies are combined together in a way that produces a new ontology but without dismantling the original ontologies OWL offers two ways to do this use owl:imports or use owl:sameAs  Again both come at a price owl:imports amounts to taking the union of all the ontologies that fall under its scope Of course this opens the door to serious problems not the least of which is that it fails to allow for ltering of any sort simply accepting other ontologiesÑand any uses they have made of owl:imports  outright paving the way for ontology explosions owl:sameAs allows a property from one ontology to be equated with another in the strictest sense Using this powerful declaration brings with it all the problems of the owl:import but with the additional inheritance of the features of each property into the other There are other approaches but they all amount to the same thing nding new ways to relate terms used within one context to the terms used in another What is important to note here is not that potential solutions already exist in the database and knowledge base communities but that the 1 Even if the more conservative estimates of others 10 29 are more accurate the challenge of integration remains signiìcant humanities community is not engaging with these solutions on any signiìcant scale Rather the humanities community is focused on building large repositories and continues to choose the assert the most threadbare vocabularies as the means of enabling this goal As suggested earlier the consequence of this will be information juke boxes repositories that are able to dish up preselected information through generic interfaces but little more If we are really interested in making the semantic web a tool which will allow us to see interesting things that we could not perceive otherwise then we need to recognize that limiting the complexity of vocabularies and ontologies so that we can easily collect as much information as possible together will not achieve this end What the humanities community needs to be doing on a larger scale is the following 1 Constructing more custom ontologies directed at capturing humanities-relevant information rather than adopting those built by other communities for other purposes 2 Pursuing the ontology integration techniques already developed to address the challenges of integration despite their complexity and the real possibility that they will not work 3 Designing inference engines speciìcally for humanities research What these activities amount to is engaging in the practice of building and contributing to the infrastructure of the semantic web rather than the practice of adding new repositories to an already existing infrastructure The erosion of difference as a result of the tendency towards homogenization that is evident in large data aggregations is not the only challenge that humanists will need to overcome in order to work meaningfully with the semantic web Others include overcoming the assumed facticity and completeness of the information that is being aggregated and the limitations of the deductive logic framework that is assumed by the majority of ontologies and inference tools available If we do not engage with the complexity of the challenges facing us with respect to data aggregation then we should not be surprised when the joy of being able to do faceted searches in a one portal rather than many wears off leaving us wondering what happened to the promise of the semantic web to allow us to discover that which we did not already know to help us plumb the speciìcities of our vast stores of knowledge for new insights VI C ONCLUSION In sum the semantic web ontologies prevalent today reveal a lack of nuance when it comes to the complex relationships between names and persons particularly with respect to authorship Moreover the generalizations required to link semantic web collections risk weakening the ability of their data representations to reîect the complexities of 82 


cultural artifacts and processes Tim Berners-Lee stresses the extent to which linking across speciìc vocabularies in his view takes precedence over speciìc vocabularies The library community has historically seen the Semantic Web as primarily about metadata While that is important it is only one aspect of the larger picture There is nancial data chemical data biotechnology data experimental data geographic data and more All of these domains have their own vocabularies with few explicit points of connection The Semantic Web is aimed at bridging those gaps and allowing links across elds Libraries have long understood the importance of established vocabularies and have led in their development To the extent that data can be encoded in common syntaxes like RDF and described with public vocabularies they can be more accessible and more useful People and applications can draw better correlations better connections better inferencing and these can lead us to more effective use of information Public here really equates to a standardized vocabulary or linked to a standard vocabulary which in effect means that local vocabularies need to be equated or generalized to standard vocabularies in order for the promised amelioration to take place RDF is clearly emerging as a standard that is effecting signiìcant changes in how data is represented exchanged and used on the web and it relies on standard ontologies to serve as the bridges between specialist vocabularies Standard ontologies can thus enable technological progress but those devising and employing them need also to be mindful of the negative impacts of standardization powerfully articulated by Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh Star Information scientists work every day on the design delegation and choice of classiìcation systems and standards yet few see them as artifacts embodying moral and aesthetic choices that in turn craft peopleês identities aspirations and dignities 4 While many standards particularly technical ones and ones associated with the natural sciences have arisen without the kind of attentiveness to difference outlined above the critique of such standards is growing witness the recent success of Melissa Terras in having the Text Encoding Initiative guidelines which previously embedded the encoding of women literally as the second sex revised Other related initiatives consider how best to model uid difference along with explorations of how encoding practices can leverage established standards without acceding to their terms Such work intersects with the Orlando Projectês attempt to translate into RDF its tagset for encoding cultural formation which is attentive to historical and cultural speciìcity related to such identity categories as sexuality ethnicity race and colour and linguistic roots More theoretically  Tara McPherson has begun investigating the ideological implications of the base technologies such as the UNIX operating system that are shaping our digital work in the humanities The questions raised here are important given the increasing uptake of semantic web technologies by research projects in the humanities and by resource providers such as libraries and museums As part of this process of adoption many existing ontologies initially developed for other technologies and purposes are being translated into semantic web form to enable the leveraging of existing metadata in a semantic web context XML schemas in particular are susceptible to such translation and there is increasing production of RDF based on existing XML markup Indeed the W3C offers the ConverterToRdf tool meant to facilitate such translations whether the migration is to RDF or to the ongoing exposure of XML data in RDF form Moreover resources are increasingly being interlinked not by human beings but by algorithms For instance in late 2012 a VIAF bot successfully added 250,000 links to Wikipedia The result will be a much more densely interlinked and one hopes interoperable semantic web than the current one but its structure will be increasingly determined by its own vocabularies and ontologies which will in turn increasingly determine what can be represented meaningfully on the web If this sounds circular thatês because it is The case of Field helps to lay bare the assumptions about the nature of authorship in relation to personhood that operate quite naturally as culturally-speciìc ideological systems do within our understanding of literary relations and the challenges that the humanities interest in the unique the outlier and the limit cases of culture pose to a semantic web framework This preliminary examination of the limitations of existing ontologies both the one that we are deriving from Orlando s bespoke XML markup and well-established ones like Dublin Core suggests that they will not adequately handle border cases despite the fact that marginality and uniqueness are what humanities scholars often seek to discover and analyse We are still in the initial stages of investigating the implications of semantic web representations for humanist research particularly as concerns the ability of such representations to reîect humanist epistemologies or ways of knowing adequately The representation of basic names of persons within the semantic web of their relationships to other names to properties

After many tweaks and focused discussion outside of the full PSRP the OPALS CBCS matrix was approved for Phase 2 As Phase 3 approaches, all agreed-to verifications of hazard controls must be performed, documented, and submitted Any deviations from the agreed-to verifications must be documented and approved by members of the PSRP In addition to the Flight Safety Reviews \(FSRs\und Safety Review schedule is also negotiated and a package is submitted.  This process is very similar to the PSRP one, but the scope of the hazards is limited to ground operations at the launch and processing facilities The key to successfully passing the FSRs has been constant early, and open communication with the PSRP. It has allowed for the quick identification of hazards and it has prevented the project from locking itself into designs that either could have adversely impacted safety or could have made compliance significantly more difficult. The PSRP and everyone involved in the safety side of the interface have shown great flexibility in allowing OPALS design freedom to ensure its mission success while enforcing a high standard for the safety of the ISS and those inhabiting it 5  D RIVERS   C ONSTRAINTS  AND R ESULTING I MPLEMENTATION  OPALS is no exception when it comes to facing the typical challenges that most space flight projects have to overcome throughout their lifecycle. Cost and schedule always seem insufficient. The workforce is sometimes stretched thin. All these challenges create constraints, end up driving the decision-making process and inescapably shape the final product. There are, however, many aspects that set OPALS apart from the average space borne instrument, and they too came with their own drivers and constraints Overall, the drivers and constraints can be classified as internal and external, with each category further divided into process- or technically-flavored This section is dedicated to examples, spanning each of those categories, of drivers and constraints that have in one way or another influenced the implementation of the project Internal, Process-Derived Drivers and Constraints The aspects falling under this section refer to those whose common denominator is the internally-mandated JPL process. The most influential and prevailing of these processes are documented in the JPL Design Principles and JPL Flight Project Practices. These documents provide guidelines on everything from cost, schedule reserves and technical margins to the pedigree of the parts and components used by the flight article and the level of documentation required Class D 227The biggest impact on the project, second only to the stringent cost cap, was the decision to implement it as a Class D payload risk classification per NASA NPR 8705.4 This decision was less of a constraint than it was a driver and it ultimately gave the project more flexibility in making decisions. The ramifications of this decision are many including the risk posture of the project in parts selection sparing philosophy, hardware handling requirements qualification program, fault protection, and extent of formal verification of requirements Early on in its lifecycle, the project sought to define the Class D implementation approach within the guidelines set by NASA procedural requirements. Specifically the project was allowed to 200  Build one proto-flight model with limited engineering models \(EMs\he only subsystem to have a full EM is the avionics. Other EMs include the acquisition camera one motor driver, and the in-house developed power board 200  Limit parts sparing to long-lead items only. The project only purchased one spare actuator and a few of the avionics cards. There are no spares for the laser, power board, camera, or any structural components 200  Use COTS hardware wherever possible. This aspect is discussed in further detail in a subsequent section 200  Forgo radiation or parts support. The extensive usage of COTS components implies, to a large extent, the absence of radiation susceptibility data, along with other environmental information. Thus, as early as the Mission Concept Review, the project and its stakeholders have accepted the potential missionending risk of unrecoverable single event upsets 200  Limit hardware and software Quality Assurance prior to system level integration and test. Typically, HQA/SQA involvement begins early in subsystem development well in advance of system I&T 200  Limit flight tech support to final torqueing and high risk procedures. The philosophy here is similar to the HQA/SQA involvement Requirements and V&V\227 Likely the most unglamorous aspect of producing a space-wo rthy payload is developing the set of requirements that govern its function and behavior. While Class-D status does not give the project a pass on developing requirements, it can shape the way the process is conducted and the extent to which requirements are developed For example, higher-class projects typically develop requirements down to level five or six, and bin them in dozens, if not hundreds of sets or modules. By contrast OPALS currently only has 782 requirements spread over 33 modules, with none of them containing more than 105 items. Of the 694 ISS requirements only 376 are applicable to OPALS, accounting for 48% of the total OPALS set Similarly, of the 117 launch vehicle requirements, only 58 are levied on OPALS. This means that the project has only 


  348 project-specific requirements that it in t verify. Figure 13 breaks down the requirements, including ISS and launc h residing at the various levels OPALS, however, is no poster child f development as it fell into the same trap t h projects\227regardless of size and risk verification and validation \(V&V\ time: it unnecessary requirements At CDR time OPALS realized that requirements it was signing up to verify d and testing, totaling almost 1300 \(796 OP A LV\, had become unmanageable give n schedule and cost-to-go.

To deal with this issue, the rigid tray assembly that houses the avionics and fans is mounted on a system of wire-rope isolators designed to dampen random vibrations within the specific frequency spectra produced by the launch vehicle These isolators protect delicate solder joints and other nonrugged components from being torn apart by launch loads Further, in much the same way as the loss of circulation during power outages provides a natural means of insulation against heat loss, the wire rope isolator system\222s poor thermal conductivity also impedes conduction to the outer structure of the sealed container External, Process-Derived Drivers and Constraints While many decisions were internally motivated by the JPL processes and the OPALS paradigm, a significant number also came via the ISS and launch vehicle interfaces, both programmatically and technically As one might anticipate, the ISS interface in particular impacted the OPALS day-to-day operations as well as the design features it implemented. The most clear example of this aspect came via the over 400 requirements imposed by the ISS program on the OPALS payload, followed by the V&V process mandated to demonstrate compliance Requirements 227As one of the first payloads to negotiate both the ISS and Dragon interfaces, OPALS has been routinely involved in technical changes beginning and ending with its interface requirements.  A considerable ongoing effort within OPALS and its partners has been to solidify the understanding of the requirements levied When OPALS began in 2009, the Dragon had neither flown nor been fully designed.  This was best represented in the miniscule 16 provided requirements that were largely placeholders for what would  become the Dragon\222s interface specification.  At that point, expectations were that OPALS would be completed well before its Dragon flight. This schedule disconnect led to a considerable technical disconnect In order to proceed with OPALS development despite the lack of a full set of design requirements assumptions had to be made in three key areas: power, connectivity, and the launch environment.  The first question of power came about for an obvious reason: OPALS has thermally sensitive optics and commercial equipment, and these components need heater power to be kept warm in space.  Without requirements on Dragon power provisions, the project\222s first assumption was that the thermal control hardware designed for the on-orbit ISS environment would also prove valid during a Dragon ascent.  After exhaustive integrated thermal analysis, this assumption, and the resulting engineering implementation, has proven to be valid, and an additional 12 pages of requirements and supporting data now reflect this interface design After requirements were negotiated and an agreement was reached to provide sufficient thermal power during ascent the question remained of how this power would be routed into the OPALS payload.  To direct the efforts towards a solution of connectivity, OPALS turned to the JAXA H-II Transfer Vehicle \(HTV\d Space Shuttle designs that powered FRAM-based payloads similar to OPALS.  These additional carrier requirements allowed several connectivity options and it was thus taken to be a valid assumption that the Dragon team could design around OPALS\222 desired cabling pin assignments.  The OPALS design was thus submitted to SpaceX and, as this was the first request for a specific option, the OPALS connectivity solution has become the primary power distribution option amongst external Dragon cargo requirements The project\222s greatest challenge, however, was the need to design the FS prior to receiving any validated launch  Figure 15: Early design of the sealed container did not optimize component pl acement or airflow  Figure 16: CFD analysis led to a new component layout that allowed for more efficient heat removal 


  16 loading requirements.  To address this, OPALS began with JPL and NASA\222s extensive historical data on expected launch loads, amended with ample margin and overlaid with standard levels on workmanship. The resulting crude spectrum was then supplied to the ISS and SpaceX dynamics teams who over the course of several months helped refine test plans to a conservative but agreeable level, which again proved to be valid \(and indeed conservative\via integrated analysis and testing. At the time of this writing OPALS had successfully completed vibration testing Lastly, the project has dealt with the uncertainty that comes via requirements variability from the ISS interface. Since OPALS began, 37% of the 694 ISS interface requirements have changed. Even though only 376 of them are applicable to OPALS, the project has had to maintain cognizance in this regard over the full set.  Despite the fact that the ISS is an operational facility and many components have been flying in orbit for several years, both OPALS and the ISSP are still learning about the function and performance of these components.  As such, there have been ample updates to the electrical and robotic interface requirement segments These requirement changes are executed methodically in a thoroughly reviewed manner.  After internal ISS coordination, pending requirement updates are quickly disseminated amongst payload developers.  After external review by existing and prospective payloads, signatures are requested and requirements are enacted V&V 227Verification and Validation includes the final work done to certify both that the payload meets the word of the requirements, and that it performs the intended function 55% of OPALS\222 requirements to be verified are provided by its external interfaces, including the ISS and Dragon Though verified along with all other project requirements these interface requirements demand a different balance of focus.  As these requirements are provided by external entities they are managed outside of JPL and subject to external verification.  OPALS, therefore, has no formal validation program for these requirements beyond ongoing interface systems engineering diligence.  While this externalized approach minimizes internal efforts, it simultaneously increases verification  overhead Verification of each external interface requirement falls under the cognizance of an external Discipline Engineer DE\d the OPALS verification program is built around this external approval process, which is diagramed in Figure 17.  These external engineers represent the external hardware expertise necessary to ultimately understand validate and approve all interactions with their hardware.  It is important to note that these engineers support a multitude of projects across geographic boundaries, and their ability to provide dedicated attention to OPALS is attenuated by the breath of the projects they support Internal to OPALS, an abundance of verification data is generated for these DEs in the verification of the 452 external requirements.  The planning, technical coordination, and direction of this work is coordinated between the OPALS External Interface Engineer and the cognizant engineers within OPALS. As data and plans have been generated over years of interaction among these organizations, it is incumbent upon the EIE to ensure internal consistency and remedy problems across evolving interfaces External, Technically-Derived Drivers and Constraints The ISS-imposed requirements provide the specification for the physical interface to the station, and, via the PSRP process, also provide direction on meeting the safety considerations that come with the Class A status of the ISS This section will highlight how technical specifications from the ISS impacted aspects of the OPALS design Mass & Power Budgets 227Most payloads will find the ISS allocation for mass and 28V operational power to be quite generous at 490 lbs. \(excluding the top half of the FRAM\227 the ExPA plate\d 504 watts, respectively. The ISS also provides 750 watts on a 120V operational line and an additional 300 watts of power on a 120V heater line Expected to come in under 400 lbs., OPALS fits well within its mass allocation. In fact, at no point in its development did the OPALS mass margin\227calculated as \(AllocationCBE\llocation\227fall below 15%, and since CDR it has been hovering around 30%. The 28V ops power margin has been even more generous, hovering at or above 60% for much of the projects lifecycle, while the 120V ops and 120V heater lines have seen equally generous margins of over 60% and 70 %, respectively In space, mass and power are drivers more often than not For OPALS the opposite has been the case, to the point where the excess allocations has been used to solve problems in other areas. One such example has been the  Figure 17:  The OPALS ISS requirement verification process is built around th e ISS approval process

  19 turn lead to a design that required forced convective cooling and vibration dampening, both uncommon for modern-day space payloads. Furthermore, it allowed the project flexibility in tailoring its verification and validation program for non-ISS requirements to save cost and schedule The focus of space-borne instruments is usually on the flight articles, which in the case of OPALS is the FRAM-based payload to be externally installed on the ISS. However most, if not all, projects must also develop a ground infrastructure to support the operations of the flight asset For OPALS, despite being more akin to an instrument than a spacecraft, that was certainly the case as significant development was required for both the optical ground station to enable the transmissi on of a beacon and receipt of the optical downlink for the former, and for the MOS to support commanding and telemetry The use of the OCTL facility in California greatly reduced the amount of development required to receive and process the optical downlink, and to transmit the beacon needed by the FS to locate the ground station. The development was thus restricted to the optics needed to condition the light beam for processing by the hardware receiver and the software decoder The design of the MOS was, by and large, dictated by the interface to the ISS\222s expansive payloads operations infrastructure located at Ma rshall Space Flight Center Because the interface was already mature and well understood, the project\222s efforts were primarily focused on ensuring compatibility rather than developing its own capability. The savings afforded by leveraging the existence of the already operating infrastructure cannot be understated A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The authors express their gratitude to the entire OPALS team for their dedication and hard work, and to the mentors that have guided the team on a path to success.
