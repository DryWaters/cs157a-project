Associafion Rule Mining and its application in posfal EMS service Duan Yun Feng Li Jian Wei Song Jun De Shu Hua Ying Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications Beijng University of Posts and Telecomrnunlcations P.O Box 192 Beijng 100876 P.R.China duanvunfenc18263.net ABSTRACT Several 
algorithms in data mining technique were studied recently among which association was one of the most important ones In this paper we introduce theory of association rule in data mining and analyze the characteristics of postal EMS service We create a data warehouse model for EMS services and give the procedure of applying association rule 
mining based on it In the end we give an example of the whole mining procedure. This EMS Data warehouse model and association rule mining technique have been applied in a practical Postal CRM System Keywords:Association rule mining Data Mining Data Warehouse Data Mart Fact Table Frequency item set EMS Post 1 INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of information technology, a new problem 
raised we are flood of data but starve of knowledge And this leads to the data mining technology Data Mining is to extract the hidden information, pattern or knowledge that very useful but not known before, from huge practical data that is not complete noisy random and fuzzy Association rule mining is an important part of data mining. By analyzing the relativity of the 
values of data stored in the database we can discover hidden association patterns The classical example of Beer-diaper is a case of association rule mining When NCR a leading company in data mining analyzed the saled products in Wal-Mart that was the largest supermarket company in the world they found that there is a high association between beer and diaper The result 
of deeper analysis showed that young father always buy beer when they buy diaper for their babies too Therefore, Wal-mart put beer and diaper together and improved the sale of the products The method of Association Rule was raised by RAgrawal in 1993 It can show the relativity of different products by generating Frequency item set In the process of generating Frequency 
item set the terms of minimum Support and minimum Confidence are used Let's take the transaction database in a supermarket as an example of Association rule I={il i2 is  im is an Item set It represents the aggregation of different products in the supermarket D={tl tz 
t3 tn is a transaction set It represents the aggregation of each transaction Association rule is an expression as follows PI A PZ A P~A  A P n ql q2A q3A   A q m 0-7803-70 I0-4/0 I TOTEE 157

On the other hand these data can tell us more information not only the behavior characters of the customer but also the relationship between the different category of services and so on If we analyze the data in a deeper level, with the data mining techniques we can raise the credibility of making decision More new convenient and profitable EMS services can be supported to the customers With the investigation of a postal office in a province we find that EMS services can be divided into following catalogs 1 EMS service in the same city 1 Pupil delivery to take the pupil to their home after class and to school before class 2 Flower express to send the flower to his friend for the customer 3 Cake express to deliver a birthday cake for a customer 4 Ticket TraWAircraft express to buy and send the ticket to the customer once they want 5 Patient delivery to take the patient to the hospital to see a doctor 6 Gifts express to deliver a gift for a customer 1 Wedding series service to prepare a band, and waiter for the wedding ceremony 2 Business Opening celebration service to prepare a ceremony when a new company start business 3 Celebration of employee\222s birthday to send a birthday cake to a employee of a company in his birthday 4 Congratulation an elder on his birthday to prepare a ceremony for an elder birthday 3 Mail delivery Delivery a mail using EMS transport network within a limited time 4 Propagandist agent While delivering mails also act as a propagandist agent to send advertisement product to the customer 5 Direct sales and so on We can find that there are many kinds of different services in the EMS system Many operational data in these services that discussed above were recorded in the database In a certain services the customer\222s name the identification card ID the address and the data alike are recorded after each transaction These data are gold only if after being mined There are a lot of patterns in data mining such as classification pattern clustering pattern, deviation pattern, association pattern and so on Here we take the association pattern mining as an example to show the process of data mining We are going to find the association rule between the different services based on the service 2 Celebration service 158 


data showed above If two services are associated, when a customer ask one service from the EMS system the EMS system can try to sale the associated service This is an example of 223Cross-sale\224 3 THE APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULE MINING Before we can find the association rule we need build up a data warehouse system In the data warehouse several fields that represent the service\222s content were added into a fact table to analyze the relativity of different services The fact table is a sign of the data warehouse and it is the raw source data for the data mining The fact table, as shown in Figure 1 is a more detail table that can show the transaction records of different users in different time It is different with the different service operational database here we need the data clean and data integrate process to prepare the data in a uniform architecture Customer-Dimension Q CustomerID IDNum Center-Dimension Q CenterlD CenterNO AreaNo Time-Dimension I Recordtime c Year I I Fact-EMS Table  ServiceTypeID\(\200Q  Recordtime FE3 Responsetime  Unittypeid Address  __ Fax 1 Tel  I I I ti b t I I bliver-area-Dimension t DliverID c I Province City County Service-Dimension Servicekscription CeliverFlag I I 1 I yy _ Level3     Fiaure 1  the fact table of EMS service data warehouse The fact table shows that each record is a detail order of EMS transaction But in association analysis we have to know the service types that a customer used So transform is needed. First we use the CustomerlD in fact table to integrate all the services that a certain customer used the result will be Referring to the field ServicetypelD in the fact table we get the service type of each ti According to our purpose \(association analysis we just record the service once if a service exists in the result more than once Now we get the record of the services used by each customer We call it transaction data set which is the set of Ti F is the target data source of the association rule mining In the procedure of Association rule mining we employ Apriori Algorithm to analyze the transaction data set F The process contains 2 steps 1 Find all the Item sets that have a Support more than the minimum Support the result Item Sets is called Frequency Set 2 Generate the rules from the Frequency Set Association rule mining mainly focuses on the generation of Frequency Set Apriori Algorithm use a process of iterative the key process is shown as follows Ti={ti f2 f3  tml 159

The last Frequency Set Lk must be a subset of Ck Each member of Ckmusf be validated in the transaction data set F to determine whether it should join Lk By computing we can get the association rule of different services in EMS system For example there is a high association between the service of sending cake and the service of sending flowers That is because many customers will send a cake with flowers Service used serviceType number 4 EXPERIMENT OF ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  1103 1104  0,5,6,7 1,4,7 Number of Transactions Number of Items Items per Transaction support Confidence 1105 I 739 1106 I 0,1,5,6 1000 10 Maximum  4 Average  2.273 Minimum  IO Maximum 100 Minimum  25 Maximum  100 Rule Support From  1 14.9000 6  2 14.9000 5  2 rules are discovered To 5  61 


Explanation of the Result From the Tables above we can see in 1000 rows of simulated data, there are 2 rules that satisfied the condition Support>=lO and Confidence>=25 Rule 1 shows that if a customer buys flowers service code 6 there is a possibility of 45.29% that he will buy cakes service code 5 Likewise, Rule 2 shows there is a possibility of 66.82 that a customer will use flower express service code 6 service if he uses the cake express service \(service code In real environment we must transform the operational data into a two-dimension form 5 like the following Table 4 Column 1 is CustomerlD a pelD This process is conducted when we extract the data from Data-Warehouse transform it into a subject-oriented data like the following Column 1 is CustomerlD IelD This process is conducted when we extract the data from Data-Warehouse; transf&m it into a subject-oriented data mart 5 CONCLUSION In our practice we apply a method in data mining--association rule mining in postal EMS service It is the first application of association rule mining in this field Also it will provide experience to the logistics research This kind of analysis shows the trend of collecting transforming and analyzing service data It will make operation decision based on scientific basis Reference 1 ZHOU Xin SHA Chao-Feng ZHU Yang-Yong and SHI Bo-Le INTEREST MEASURE-ANOTHER THRESHOLD IN ASSOCIATION RULES Journal of Computer Research Development 2000-5 2 CAI Wei Jie Zhang Xiao Hui, Zhu Jian Qiu Zhu Yang Yong A summary of Mining with Association Analysis http://dmgroup.

single bond  aromatic bond single bOnd  aromatic bDnd d CBO Figure 9 Two fragments extracted from a sei of steroids On the left, single and aromatic bonds were treated as different bond types. on the right they were treated as the same bond type 3.4 Treatment of Aromatic Bonds An important aspect of molecular fragment mining is the treatment of aromatic rings Since ammaticity is not clearly defined and can be modeled differently i.e explicit aro matic bonds vs alternating single and double bonds it is desirable to be able to take it into account throughout the mining process itself We achieve this by modeling aro matic bonds as either single or double bonds with a flag that indicates aromaticity This allows us to choose to ignore this flag during mining and hence to find fragments that contain either aromatic or single resp double bonds The following example illustrates why this is desirable Using a small set of steroid compounds we derived frag ments that occur in ail of them support=100%\using the standard algorithm Figure 9 left shows the correspond ing fragment Note how only two rings with an incomplete third ring are discovered of the four ring structure that is typical for steroids However if we model aromatic bonds as single+flag and allow the algorithm to ignore this flag the resulting fragment contains all four rings see Figure 9 right For some steroids this fourth ring consists of sin gle bonds while others have an aromatic ring at this posi tion However most chemists still regard this as the same 4 ring structure Such selective 223tolerance\224 against some mis matches can therefore make the presented algorithm more useful for real applications 4 Conclusions We presented an algorithm to find relevant molecular frag ments in large chemical structure databases The algorithm allows us to focus on fragments that help to discriminate be tween different classes of molecules The underlying search method, which is based on a depth first search with struc tural pruning makes it possible to find such fragments effi ciently without the need for frequent reembeddings of frag ment candidates, which is a known problem of previously reponed approaches We have shown how the proposed method finds relevant fragments using data from a well known HIV-screening compound database The extracted fragments successfully model several of the activity classes known for this dataset Future work will focus on making the presented approach more meaningful for the underlying application In partic ular finding fragments that match exactly is not of prime interest to chemists As demonstrate above some types of ring structures are considered functionally equivalent which should be taken into account by the search algorithm as well We are currently exploring ways to include such 223fuzziness\224 into the underlying search algorithm directly References I R Agrawal T Imielienski and A Swami.

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
