The spiral propulsion relation between the modern logistics and the city economy represents the characteristics of the cooperating development. In this essay the inner coupling mechanism and stages of the city logistics and economic development will firstly be discussed., It is then followed by the analysis the order parameter of the Coupling of the city economy and the logistics and evaluation analysis model and methods of the coupling of the city economy and logistics based on the artificial neural network. The data using in the an 
alysis was taken from a certain big city in China. At the end of the paper, the suggestions of some possible solutions to improve the coupling of the city logistics and the economic are given suggested according to the research. Finally a brief conclusion will be given at the end in the text Key Words Coupling, Artificial Neural Network, Logistics I  INTRODUCTION With the fast development of Chinese Economy and the improvement of economic structure, its domestic logistics industry develops rapidly  at the same time. The requirement emphasis of the Logistic under current Chinese economy situation is switching from largely focused on quantity to 
qualityof domestic economy is converting from the quantity to the quality. The modern logistics can lower the economy operating cost, promote the economic operating quality, carry out the economize growth mode, and guarantee the sustainable development of economy The development of modern logistics in China is severely imbalanced. The modern logistics industry is highly developed in the eastern coastal region, which has become the cornerstone industry in Zhujiang Delta such as Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and it is also advanced in Changjiang Delta such as Shanghai and Suzhou. The modern logistics industry mutual re 
lated and the local economy development are closely inter-correlated and promoted with the local econo my  The logistics industry is still unenlightened in lots of cities in the western region of China, with still applying the traditional logistic model, so it which is not well balanced between the economy and the logistics It is important to do a research of the coupling mechanism between urban economy and logistics, in order to find out their intrinsic relation between demand and supply, make sure the coupling degree with each other, as well as put forward the method to improve the coupling degree. The research plays a significant role in promoting the development of

Coupling & coupling relationship Coupling original as a concept of physical, it means the influence phenomena was brought by two \(more than two systems or movements interaction effect, for example the two poles of amplifier, signal magnify by Resistive and capacitive coupling or transformer coupling; and Mutual inductance between the two coils through magnetic coupling.

can be considered as two different things turn to a system by mutual promotion, restraint, and linked, that means every subsystems have dynamic association relationship based on interdependence, mutual coordination and promotion Coupling relationship describes a relationship of interaction effects among systems and factors, based on coupling. In this paper, influence which was produced by logistics and economy coupling factor was called coupling B  Coupling relationship between city logistics and economy There’s an interaction mechanism between urban logistics and economy. It is a law that modern logistics industry mutual related and promoted with the local economy, and the existing of the interaction coupling and positive feedback loop is one of the main forms of it. There’re various principal contradictions or different major aspects of the contradiction in every period, which lead to distinct development modes The coupling between the urban logistics and economy is based on the certainty or uncertainty of demand and supply However the effect may change and then several modes appear. The coupling relation follows the rule of their spiral by a cycle turning way. It also emphasizes the “limited balance” of the demand and supply, in order to realize the sequential decision of multi-stage and the synergetic process from out of order to in good order There are three modes of coupling between urban logistics and economy Mode 1: “logistic chasing” mode As the rapid economic growth in the city, the demand for logistics grows at the same time, which the local logistics industry can not be met. So the coupling between urban logistics and economy presents in chasing. The condition of software and hardware for the modern logistics industry should be improved. That means the capacity of transportation and storage facility should be enhanced, as well as the logistic management, in the interest of satisfying the economic need Logistic forerunner” mode The economic development is enslaved to the capacity of transportation facility in those cities where the transportation is underdevelopment or in the harbor cities. A majority of the domestic harbor cities bring in the strategy of booming the city by the port”. That’s a reflection of the logistic forerunner” mode. The logistic facilities, especially the construction of the transportation facilities become the base of the economic development. Logistics industry has been considered to be cornerstone and the forerunner of the whole city Mode 3: “logistics-economy association” mode When the logistic demand and supply can assort with each other and can meet the need of the economic growth, the coupling between the urban logistics and economy present itself mostly in the “logistics-economy association” mode The economic growth calls for the development of logistics in capacity and quality. The logistics industry has to apply itself to the promotion of its quality and the optimization to its structure, together with increasing the capacity, which provides the local economy with favorable environment. The modern logistics industry mutual related and promoted with the local economy By regulating the modes of coupling between urban logistics and economy, the contradictions between demand and supply can be solved by following the alternant evolvement rule, and the strategic target of the economic development can be finally accomplished III  ANALYSIS OF CITY LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY COUPLING RELATIONSHIP BASED ON SYSTEM DYNAMICS A  Importance of System Dynamics analysis  In System Dynamics, system is made up of cell movements of cell and information; it is entia of structure and function. The basic structure is feedback loop; it is a loop of state of system, velocity and information, these elements corresponding to the three components of system: cell movement and information. According to character of feedback process, it separated into positive feedback and negative feedback. Character of positive feedback is it is able to generate self-reinforcing mechanism, but negative feedback’s is that is able to generate self-inhibition mechanism. Complex system behavior is decided by cross mechanism of positive and negative feedback loop With further development of city logistics and economy logistics plays more and more important role. System dynamics is imported to research of city logistics and economy, the meaning are to analyze and think interaction effect of city logistics and economy by view of system, to examine their relationship on the whole situation and overall perspective, and then to develop potential to improve and make up the shortfall, to coordinated develop city and logistics enterprise B  Coupling relationship of city logistics and economy evaluation system based on system dynamics Decision of subsystem and System indicators factors  City logistics and economy coupling relationship evaluation system was built up to analyze the coupling relationship of city logistics and economy by system dynamics, it concludes two subsystems: subsystem of city logistics supply and subsystem of city economy development coupling model was based on th eoretic of system dynamics showed figure 2-1

The model is composed of three parts; they are efficacy function coupling degree function and BP network prediction model of coupling degree A  Selection of sequence parameter Economy and logistics coupling process is a process

The coupling function of urban logistics and economy shows C n U\(u 1  000y U\(u 2 U\(u 1 u 2  000y U\(u 1  1/2 4 Obviously, the value of the coupling degree is between 0 and 1. when Cn 015 1,the degree of coupling reaches its maximum, systems achieve positive resonance coupling between the internal elements ,then tends to a new ordered structure; when C= 0, the degree of the coupling gets smaller no relations among systems, neither their inside elements The system tends to a development of out-of-order D  BP forecast model of coupling value Artificial neural network has many abilities, such as learning ability, parallel processing capacity, and legend storage capacity. Particularly, the three feed-forward neural network is provided with power of approximation to arbitrary complex nonlinear connection. It shows the dynamic and phased characteristic in the process of the coupling between economy and Logistics, so it is applicable to forecast the situation of the dynamic coupling in the next five years.

Before forecast coupling set up BP model like Figure 3-1,then using data in Table 4-1 to train and simulate BP model, in which economic development needs parameter city logistics supply parameter and coupling for 1998,2001,2004 are used as testing samples, taking part in simulation; the other 7 groups of data are used as training sample, training for BP model According to network forecast BP model, two groups of parameter are used as input variables of BP model; use network was trained to simulate coupling values of evaluation model, Table4-2 shows  T ABLE 4-2 COUPLING AND PARAMETER FORECAST VALUE OF LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY INXUZHOUCITY  Year 2007 2008 2009 Economic development needs parameter 0.2933 0.3172 0.4173 City logistics supply parameter 0.2267 0.2598 0.3596 Coupling degree 0.4968 0.5027 0.5071 Year 2010 2011 Economic development needs parameter 0.5435 0.7572 City logistics supply parameter 0.4098 0.4765 Coupling degree 0.5175 0.5206 Analyze data from Table 4-1and Table4-2, value of coupling between 0.49-0.5, coupling relationship, between logistics and economy is at an intermediate stage, coupling show fluctuation. The fluctuations of coupling show that normal development of logistics and economy is reciprocity When economy develop well, the need of logistics is growing, if supplement of logistics doesn’t satisfy the need coupling fall; if development of logistic keep the balance of need and supplement, coupling rise. Analyze from model, the development model of them is “logistics chasing”. Data from tables show that development rate of economy is faster than logistics, so hardware and software of logistics should be 


improved to be suitable to economic development, and then the balance can be kept To improve the coupling of logistics and economy achieve cooperation between logistics and economy government should play great role in city logistics and economy; city logistics infrastructure should be promoted vigorously, logistics network should be built up; development of e-commerce should be promoted actively, lever of industry information should be upgraded VI  STRATEGIES OF ENHANCING CITY LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY COUPLING RELATIONSHIP Logistics and economy supplement each other, the level of logistics development is determined by the level of economic development, and logistics development can be promoted development of economy with a rapid speed Logistics states and logistics activities are closely linked by economic operation environment. In order to promote city logistics and economy coupling relationship, seize the development opportunity of city logistics, enhance the competitive capability of city regional economy; this paper gives some advice as follows A  Give full play to city logistics and economy of government. In the development process of city logistics and economy, government promotion is an absolutely necessary element. Having been effected by planned economy so many years, the government’s management functions for logistics are separated by several functional departments. It is difficult to allocate resources effectively in this mode, and the policies are not perfect. The government department should persist the principle of that the logistics unifies the city overall economy development, the government guidance unifies the enterprise independent development, the government should formulate the policy and the laws for logistics, completes the macro-control of city logistics B  Construct city logistics network, and establish logistics center in the city economy center. Unite the water transportation, the road, the aviation, the railway together as an intercommunication network, to provide Multi-model Transportation in the operation, promote the integration of logistics further, optimize its industrial structure, satisfy the growth of the logistics need that comes from the fast development of economy ,establish the high level multi-purpose, strong collection and distribution function socialization logistics center, has the vital role in the city and in the local development, promote the primary industry, the second industry to reduce the cost, enhance the economic efficiency and optimize industrial structure. The quantity and quality of the logistics demand is closely related with the level of economic development C  Today development of e-commerce and industrialization logistics should be actively promoted. Technology is very important, and information technology is important to high efficiency logistics. With information technology such as bar coding, EDI technology, automatic sorting technology Freight tracking system, GPS and electronic ordering system etc,  make merchandise flow, logistics, information flow and fund flow synchronization under the surroundings of e-commerce. Rationalization and modernization of logistics will low cost of economy, improve the city economy move and quality, also it will promote rapid economic growth further  REFERENCE    LI Ji 014 zi 031 LIU Chun 014 ling 031 CHANG Ya 014 ping 031 LI Bai 014 xun 031 Integrated Analysis of the Organiza tional Succession in Cluster Supply Chain and the Development of Logistical Park 014§\014  014 The Case Study of IT Industry in Suzhou  China Soft Science   2006  P108-116   WA NG Yu 031 LE Mei-long 031 Business Logistics Outsourcing Decision Based on Artificial Neutral Network  2005  P83-86 031 101   Wenqin Cao  Junmin Yi, Relative economy factor influencing middle city logistics requirement and its relative analysis 2006 P242-243 


that had a larger allocation ITL testing smoothed the transition Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer INMS Perhaps the primary reason that the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer INMS was included in Cassini's instrument suite was to analyze the atmosphere at Titan to inform the final decisions that would be made regarding the probe mission As Cassini neared this phase of the mission the INMS experienced unexpected resets The INMS team brought an EM INMS instrument to the ITL from their facilities at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in order to take advantage of the ITL's CDS H/W and debug the problem Although the bug was not found this work enabled the INMS team to develop a strategy to work around the problem and successfully return the valuable data Cosmic Dust Analyzer CDA At various times the Cosmic Dust Analyzer CDA team has brought a flight spare and an EM CDA to the ITL from their home base at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg Germany They have used the ITL to successfully debug anomalous behavior and to validate and verify FSW deliveries Post-launch it was discovered that the in-flight CDA was susceptible to single event latch-ups The behavior was studied and a workaround was developed and tested in the ITL The solution involves a signal from the CDA when the condition is detected which triggers a CDS Fault Protection response that is executed by the PPS The use of the ITL was essential for developing and testing the solution on the ground as it could not be done in the CDA's stand-alone testbed The flight spare CDA was used in the ITL to ensure that changes to internal task scheduling in a new CDA FSW delivery did not affect S/C bus interaction S/C bus traffic timing analysis and system level tests were needed to demonstrate that proper functioning of the new FSW and this testing could only have been accomplished in the ITL 9 ANOMALY RESOLUTION There have been a few in-flight anomalies for Cassini 7 The ITL has been used in such cases to recreate the anomalous conditions and to test the recovery processes and the uplink products that were used in the recoveries In September 2007 there was a Solid State Power Switch SSPS 8 trip that resulted in a S/C safing event Cassini's first safing event during its primary mission The SSPS was one of a redundant pair powering the prime Telemetry Control Unit TCU Since this is a vital device the trip resulted in safing The safing event occurred only hours after an Iapetus flyby and recovery had an increased urgency as the science community anxiously awaited that data After the flight team confirmed the failure playback of the Iapetus flyby data was commanded and the process to be followed for recovery was identified The special files and procedures required for the recovery were tested in the ITL and the recovery was accomplished successfully in flight 10 TRAINING Periodically the Cassini flight team conducts Operational Readiness Tests ORTs These are essentially exercises in which a hypothetical problem is presented to the flight team and the team must formulate and execute a recovery The ITL is used to simulate the problem and the recovery providing the team with as realistic an experience as possible as for the AACS and CDS subsystems at least telemetry from the ITL is very similar to flight telemetry Additionally only a small subset of the flight team is dedicated to preparing the fault scenario those team members responsible for designing the fault and initializing the testbed then step aside under strict orders to maintain silence while the rest of the team determines and corrects the fault These ORTs have tremendous value the TCU SSPS fault that actually occurred in flight and was discussed in the preceding section was fortuitously chosen by the Cassini Spacecraft Office Manager Julie Webster as the fault scenario for an ORT in 2006 which of course made detection and recovery when the fault actually occurred in flight even more swift and sure The Cassini ITL has also been used to train both Cassini personnel and new JPL employees who have been hired for other project assignments Such training has involved the engineer functioning as a test analyst for 6 months The ITL benefits from the extra manpower and the employee benefits from the training and the exposure to a large flight project 11 CONCLUSION Cassini continues to enjoy a long and successful primary mission The ITL has been an important component in that success and continues to provide valuable services to the mission These services include  Deferred FSW Development and Testing  Unplanned FSW Development and Testing  FSW Updates  Ground System Testing 7 


 Flight Activity Testing  Flight Instrument Testing  Anomaly Resolution  Training The ITL has proven its value to the Cassini Mission to Saturn time and again Originally created for the integration of flight H/W and the development of FSW the ITL was maintained to accomplish Cassini's deferred development Interestingly enough while that deferred development was taking place the ITL was becoming an essential component of instrument testing and sequence development as well as maneuver and flight activity testing So in Cassini's case the ITL was necessary for post-launch activities i.e deferred development but as a result of being available during the prime mission proved to be an invaluable resource for purposes that were not originally anticipated The cost of the ITL has varied over the course of the Cassini mission but typically approaches 10 of the Cassini Spacecraft Office Operations budget i.e the engineering operations budget as distinguished from the science operations budget At present the ITL annual budget is approximately 800,000 during Integration during Assembly Test and Launch Operations ATLO and during critical sequence testing the ITL team was larger and so the cost was higher The annual cost to maintain the testbed regular cleaning certifications instrument calibration facilities maintenance etc is approximately 25,000 These costs are significant but not prohibitive and this paper has shown that the ITL has proven to be a valuable asset to the Cassini Mission and has justified its expense As Cassini plans its 3-year extended mission the ITL is included in that plan to continue in its present capacity That capacity includes engineers with expertise in the AACS and the CDS who function as test operators and analysts engineers with expertise in SE H/W and S/W who maintain the SE and implement improvements and a System Administrator the ITL maintains a web page so that test reports and test data are web-accessible and the data is also archived With some overlap in expertise and some engineers working only part-time on Cassini the ITL team at the present time is comprised of the equivalent of about 4 full time employees Many flight projects use System Testbeds for the purposes of integrating flight H/W and testing critical activities purposes that are sometimes accomplished by launch and generally by arrival at their destinations The author recommends that such flight projects seriously consider maintaining System Testbeds throughout the lives of their missions The use of a System Testbed the Cassini ITL has activities removed errors and oversights in flight procedures through testing credibly tested ground system tools and software improved maneuvers and solved problems that have occurred in flight At less than 10 of the engineering operations budget System Testbeds provide improved reliability improved functionality a significant and positive impact on mission success and a substantial return on investment ACRONYMS AACS  ATLO  CAPS  CDA  CDS  EM ESA FSW  HGA  HIW  IEB INMS ISS ITL IVD IVP JPL MGDS NAC  NASA  ORT  OTM  PPS RCS REU RFS RSS RWA S/C SCET SE SFP SoI SRU SSA SSPS SSR TCM TCU VIMS WAC Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem Assembly test and Launch Operations Cassini Plasma Spectrometer Cosmic Dust Analyzer Command and Data Subsystem Engineering Model European Space Agency Flight Software High Gain Antenna Hardware Immediate Execution Block Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer Imaging Science Subsystem Integrated Test Lab Inertial Vector Definition Inertial Vector Propagation Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multi-mission Ground Data System Narrow Angle Camera National Aeronautics and Space Administration Operational Readiness Test Orbit Trim Maneuver Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem Reaction Control System Remote Engineering Unit Radio Frequency Subsystem Radio Science Subsystem Reaction Wheel Assembly Spacecraft Spacecraft Event Time Support Equipment System Fault Protection Saturn Orbit Insertion Stellar Reference Unit Sun Sensor Assembly Solid State Power Switch Solid State Recorder Trajectory Correction Maneuver Telemetry Control Unit Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer Wide Angle Camera improved science data return improved instrument 8

an attribute specified for each transport channel TrCH and depending one limitation This limitation is that only one symbol In the special blocks description we also focused our attention parameters case where ensure the suitable end frame size which corresponds to the specified bit rate and the spreading factor After this Rate Matching RM is applied This process plays the key role in further procedures The matching ensure the right way for physical channels mapping and data processing After multiplexing all TrCHs into can be mapped onto we choose the size of transport block equal to 1280 bits Hence this step we can be eliminated from the system Next step in signal processing is presented by Frame segmentation element Figure 11 Example of pseudo code for radio frame segmentation module Frame segmentation should be done to we can avoid the presence of this procedure PhCH mapping process includes few items Data mapping Channelization and Scrambling As shown in the Figure 1 on SDR blocks work The step-by-step data exchange between one or more Coded Composite Transport Channels CCTrCH one or several PhCHs If one PhCH is used common and special blocks is presented in Figure 12 vi r fIJMT 4ooo o Figure 12 Data processing block scheme 10 READ module rfsegmentation DETERMINE number of frames SET input signal to particular input port IF number of frame more than 1 THEN EXTRACT first data bits of input bits sequence SET framel equals to input data bits PRINT length of framel EXTRACT next data bits of input bits sequence SET frame2 equals to next part PRINT length of frame2 EXTRACT last data bits of input data bits SET frameN equals to last data bits PRINT length of frameN SET output sequence equals to framel frame2 frameN ENDIF SET output port equals to output on two different modules for both chains spreading module for UMTS and IFFT256 for WiMAX Spread spectrum mechanism is the most important thing in whole signal processing chain of WCDMA PHY It is based on the Direct Sequence which provides the expending of one PhCH hence are calculated As ensures equality of the total bit rate after transport channel TrCH multiplexing to the total channel bit rate of the allocated dedicated physical channels PhCH The main parameter of the rate matching is on the upper layers During this step the determination of the spreading factor and the number of physical channels needed for the given number of TrCH we can map CCTrCH into Physical Channel but there is one CCTrCH we have we have to apply PhCH segmentation block In our system implementation we consider a QPSK mapping is used for Data Mapping in Physical channel mapping processing This scheme maps every two bits into signal END 1 E a result of fulfilling this step the correct form of TrCH multiplexing is selected that a bandwidth by unique channelization code This code should be generated by code-tree of orthogonal variable spreading factor OVSF codes Thus it guarantees the orthogonality between different channels during signal transmission 1 In OFDM chain the main role is played by IFFT256 that converts time domain presentation into frequency domain and provides orthogonal independency between adjacent subcarriers 4.3 Main Procedures between SDR blocks There are a set of inherent procedures in the system work which must be done during the signal transmission between SDR blocks 1 Verification the signal nature 2 Switching to particular signal path 3 Reconfiguration of the system according to required protocol scheme 4 Stepby-step signal processing 5 Signal transmission in the chosen mode These procedures present only basic process The BB processing which this paper is presented based more than 


This figure presents the data flow through main blocks that can be used a few times and special blocks that must execute only particular functions Here also Configurator of chain and Sequences library for WiMAX/UMTS modules are equipped First one is responsible for right construction of next processing path and second one stores necessary number of elements After signal verification system is reconfigured according to input data and with using the chosen protocol type The OUTPUT connects to radio link and then signal must be transmitted over one of six channel types And at the reception side we configure the receiver in relation to transmitted mode 5 HARDWARE PLATFORM SELECTION Current technologies in a hardware environment allow to test our system in real-time implementation There are a couple of DSP based platforms that can be selected for validation from Lyrtech Inc the Small Form Factor SFF Software Communication Architecture SCA Development the Small Form Factor SFF Softwaredefined Radio SDR Development Platform the Small Form Factor SFF Software-defined Radio SDR Evaluation Module 20 All these platforms are based on TMS320DM6446 DMP SoC from Texas Instruments 21 For the proposed SDR based system we chose the SFFSDR Evaluation board see Figure 13 as far as this platform supports WiMAX technology model based design tools accelerating prototyping implementation of all protocols layers for complete radio stacking extra boards operates with 297MHz ARM926EJ-s RISC CPU and 594MHz C64x DSP in sense of power management this module has MSP430 MCU Due to an availability of Virtex-4 SX35 FPGA from Xilinx 22 this module can perform implementation of full modem processing functions that is very important feature in meaning of multi-protocol architecture of our system We are able to vary our requirements to each protocol inside the same hardware structure Figure 13 SFF SDR development platform by Lyrtech 6 PROTOTYPING THE WiMAX/UMTS SYSTEM The WiMAX/UMTS system is implemented in high-level language as C with the class library The main accent was done on the correct form of the signal processing sequence The path for WiMAX or UMTS signal is determined in the beginning and system should verify its entity leads the system in a relevant direction The main goal of this software implementation is to check how our system can handle the input signal sequence The simulation was carried out for following parameters for each subsystem For UMTS we consider transport block with 1280 bits size frame size is 2400 bits channelization code with 16 chips sequence For WiMAX we generate the bit block is equal to 1280 bits however during channel coding operation this block is divided on turbo coding block that include 384 bits The size of turbo coding block forms from the block determination corresponding modulation type and number of subchannels During software verification we obtained that our proposed model can separate different paths subject to a type of an inter sequence in the software environment The framework of our WiMAX/UMTS system went through one scenario step and now we are directed to an extension of this model For the more detailed system visualization we integrate our C code modules into MATLAB library by means of proper dynamic linking libraries dll compiled by using the MATLAB C compiler Each block can be formed with extended parameters Modules with C code configurate the system work in a host This host implementation will present a prototype This prototype will help to analyze future real-time hardware implementation MATLAB prototype can also provide debugging of real system the result of real system must be equal to our MATLAB prototype Next step of the work development and verification is to implement it into the hardware platform based on DSP DSP based platform allows to organize signal processing in a digital presentation that serves SDR based part of our general system 7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we considered the framework of WiMAX/UMTS baseband level system for mobile device in UL transmission direction We presented the different signal processing structures based on OFDM and WCDMA physical layer procedures Our research work is mainly devoted to developing the approach of seamless switching between different subsystems that can be realized by SDR technology implementation To this end we proposed a possible solution to allow coexistence of different data transmission technologies 11

14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
