A body surface coordinator for implanted biosensor networks Bin Zhen, Kenichi Takizawa, Takahiro Aoyagi and Ryuji Kohno National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, 3-4 Hikarino-oka, Yokosuka, 239-0847, Japan Email: zhen.bin@nict.go.jp  Summary Biomedical sensors can be implanted and networked in the human body for health monitor, diagnosis treatment or as a prosthetic device. Life time and heat generated by implant due to communication and circuitry power consumption are big concerns. This paper presents a new network architecture for long range communications in the implanted sensor networks. We measured the on-body propagation around body surface and in-body propagation through tissue in the frequency ranges of 403MHz and 2.45GHz. We have found that the in-body path loss is more 
than that of on-body. To exploit the path loss difference, we propose to introduce a body surface coordinator which has more resources to the implanted sensor networks. Instead of only routing data among implants, the coordinator on the body surface can forward data from one implant to another over long distance more safely and efficiently Keywords Wireless sensor networks, body area networks implant communications, propagation loss I. Introduction Medical implants have a history of outstanding success in the monitor of patient\222s condition and in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including heart disease gastrointestinal tract, neurological disorders, cancer detection, handicap rehabilitation and general health monitor. Recently there has been an interest in the long distance communication between implants. In e u r al  
activities from brain or nerves system in the head are decoded to dynamic control the heart rate of pacemaker and generate neural stimulation sequence for cardiovascular control in the chest. The wireless link between external device and medical implant and between medical implants enables a doctor to reprogram therapy and obtain useful diagnosis information; the link among implant devices enables in vivo timely reactive treatment 2  The medical implants must operate with limited power supply because of the restricted space inside the body Besides, there is a concern of the harmful heat effect when the electromagnetic wave propagates through the surrounding body tissues. The power dissipation of continuous operating circuit is another heat source. The total energy absorbed by tissue is described by Specific Absorption Rate \(SAR\hirdly the medical implants are 
expected to years of life time because it is unpractical and uneconomical to have surgery operation frequently. These requirements ignite the research on low power modulation and routing protocol for implanted sensor networks 2  In this paper, we propose a new network architecture for medical implanted sensor networks by introducing a body surface coordinator based on the path loss measurements of on-body and in-body propagation. The coordinator can route data between implants more energy efficient because the attenuation of radio wave around body surface is far less than that of through body tissues. The remainder of paper is organized as follows. Section II gives an overview of related work and motivation of this paper. In section III and IV, propagation losses around body and through body in 403 MHz and 2.45 GHz are addressed by experiment 
We present new network architecture by introducing a body surface coordinator to the implanted senor networks in Section V. Section VI finally concludes the paper II. Related work and motivation The wireless interface of medical implant is challenged by its unique and fundamental difference from other sensor networks. Federal Communication Committee allocated a frequency band in 402-405MHz for medical implant communication service \(MICS\ a shared, secondary basis in 1999. This frequency band best meets the technical requirements of implant communication for a number of reasons 4 Compared with the MICS band, the 2.4GHz ISM band would go beyond for peer-to-peer networking support, wide bandwidth, high data rate, mature chip design, and a small antenna design \(therefore a small size 
of implant 5-7  Traditional routing protocols for ad hoc network are not appropriated for in vivo implanted sensor networks mainly because of the SAR consideration. Gupta et al considered thermal effects of biosensor by rotating cluster header based on leadership history and sensor location 8 They then proposed TRAR to route data away from the high temperature spots and area 9 Follow this direction, LTRT convert node temperature into graph weights and minimize temperature of the whole route 10 Research in s h o w s  that a hybrid of chain and cluster based network architecture is more efficient than tree-based approach Cooperation among sensors is considered in H o w e v e r 
most of the routing research ignores the underlying implant channel properties in different frequency bands There is only a little research on the radio channel of wireless implant communication.

200  on-body communications within portable networks and systems on the body surface, and 200  in-body communications from out-of-body systems to medical implants The antenna and propagation around the body is different from those in the free space because of the effect of body tissue which mostly consists of salt water in the near field The body surface channels mainly depend on space wave and surface wave propagation.

We summarized the obtained on-body path gain model in Table II. Figure 1 also shows the path gain in the free space  n d PG studied and reviewed the on-body communication systems in 2.4GHz ISM band. Compared with free space propagation, a larger attenuation around body surface and more fluctuation in received energy due to body motions were observed In the summarized medical implant applications of TG6 there is always a portable device on the surface of body or in the vicinity of body e.g PDA or cell phone, to manage the network and serve as gateway to connect the BAN to the Internet 18 This tells us that we can always have an onbody device in the vicinity area of body in real medical implant applications. Although the on-body device may also be resource limited, it is relatively more powerful compared with the medical implants. The implanted sensor networks can exploit the on-body device for better management and operation In the next two sections, we measure and model the path gain of on-body and in-body communications III. On-body propagation We measured the propagation loss over body surface in the anechoic chamber using a vector network analyzer Agilent E8363B\ 400MHz and 2.4GHz. The experiment objects are human body and phantom body in static standing posture. Table I list experiment setup. The dipole antenna and collinear antenna was attached on to the upper half of body at number of positions, where the receiver antenna was put in the middle of abdomen, and the transmitter antennas was on the writs, arm, rib, chest shoulder and head. A 15mm separation was maintained by worn antenna and body surface. All positions are in the line-of-sight. Each S-parameter, S 21 was measured by vector network analyzer 10 times at each position Figure 1 plots the measurements over body surface, which is lower than those over free space. This can be attributed to different tissues and more diffraction and absorption of radiation by human body. Besides, there are more fluctuations in measurement over the human body, which can be attributed the slow movement of the body e.g  aspiration. The path gain around body surface in dB can be written by bdaPG This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE ICC 20\09 proceedings  003 004 4 with loss coefficients n=2 or comparison. At 403MHz frequency band, the path gain over body surface is about 10dB lower constantly in the considered distances. At 2.4GHz frequency band, the distance dependent difference in path gain indicates the path loss coefficients is more than 2 for on-body communication. The result is in accordance with  d ot h e r res earch    Table I  Measurement setup  Frequency band \(MHz Antenna On-body experiment 400-450 Dipole  2400-2500 Collinear  In-body experiment 403 Dipole  2450 Biconical Table II  Summary of parameters of on-body path gain model 400-450MHz 2450 MHz  Phantom 23.64, -35.36 48.32, -71.40 Human 33.08, -50.99 46.06, -63.68             10 2                     10 3   phantom  10 2                     10 3   phantom  0                                                                                                               45   40   35   30   25   20   15   10   5   human  70   60   50   40   30   20   10                                                                                                                   human  free space              50   80   free space   Fig. 1  Measured path loss for on-body radio propagation: a 400MHz and b\ 2.4GHz  IV. In-body propagation Human tissue is a lossy medium for wireless communication. The energy of electromagnetic wave dissipates as heat and attenuates considerably when they reach receiver because most tissues \(skin and muscle consist of high water content. The losses are mainly due to absorption of power in tissue in terms of SAR. We thus modeled the path loss by mainly considering the power absorbed by tissues A. Homogeneous phantom experiment We measured the in-body propagation loss in the anechoic chamber at 403MHz and 2.4GHz. The signal source is a swallowable capsule endoscope with a coin antenna. An acrylic vessel \(30cm diameter\illed with liquid phantom used for SAR evaluation of human head to represent human ventral. Table III lists the dielectric parameter of the phantom. After pre-amplification \(ELENA EAU-3618GXA low noise amplifier\e received power was measured by spectrum analyzer \(Agilent E4407B\ The reception antennas listed in Table I were set at 1.5cm, 10cm and 20cm from outer surface of the vessel. And the capsule transmitter was set from 5cm to 15cm distance from the inner surface of the vessel. The signal source is fully sealed inside the capsule to avoid the impact of experiment systems. Therefore we cannot directly measure the output power of transmitter and S-parameters \(specifically S 21  We first filled the vessel with liquid phantom. Then we measured the through-air propagation in the same

It is clear that 2.4GHz radio has more attenuation than 403MHz radio. Generally, throughphantom propagation attenuates faster than through-air propagation. There is an additional attenuation at same distances  As shown in Fig. 2\(a\hen the dipole antenna at 403MHz is 5cm to the vessel, a positive relative path gain was obtained. This can be attributed to the close distance which is comparable to the wavelength and superposition of incidence wave and reflection wave due to the interface between different mediums.

Layer tissues analysis Usually a medical implant is covered by layered structure For example, a pacemaker is implanted in the heart muscle under skin and fat. We considered a layered half space with interfaces at Nizz i 1 212 212 212  Then it is straightforward to compute all C\222s using Eq. 5 Figure 3 shows the propagation gains of different homogeneous tissues and the liquid phantom used in previous measurement. The less path losses in fat than those in skin and muscle can be attributed to less water content in fat. The liquid phantom has the most path loss In general, the thickness of skin may range from 0.1 to 1 cm or more, and a layer of fat may be from 0.5 to 1.5 cm thick. Figure 4 plots the path gain a in three-layered body  e.g pacemaker\with specified thickness of skin and fat Without losing generality, we assumed the first air-skin interface is at z=0 The effect of layers can be observed. In the layered region, there are both forward and backward traveling wave because the field is partly reflected and DP \(10cm

The superposition of the two waves yields the resultant wave in the region, which has both standing- and traveling wave characteristics. The small oscillation of electric field energy in skin and fat is a consequence of standing wave in these regions. After cross the fat-muscle boundary, the electric field attenuates monotonously. Given the same depth \(distance\, path gain in layered body is lower than that in homogeneous tissue which is about -14dB and 16dB respectively in the analyzed case. This can be at tributed to the reflection loss impendence mismatch\he layer boundary          This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE ICC 20\09 proceedings fat   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90   100   20   15   10   5   5                                                                                                                       0   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90   100   45   40   35   30   25   20   15   10   5   5                                                                                                                 20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90   100   60   50   40   30   20   10   2.45GHz     Fig. 4 Path gain in a three-layered structure \(skin: 0.5cm, fat: 1cm and muscle  Although the path gain model is simple, it reveals the propagation difference in layered body and in free space The layered body gives rise to variations in path gain due to refection. The exact field depends on the thickness of each layer, which varies between individuals and applications and with time, and border condition. The additional path loss due to layered tissue structure was mentioned in [19   According e dielect ric pro p erties of a larg e part of human tissues can be covered by the values listed in Table III. Hence, most human tissues will generate a curve situated closely to the ones in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 V. New network architecture for multihop implanted sensor networks Long distance communication among implant devices was considered in [8-12 T h e m o tiv atio n is to b a lan ce th er m a l  effect resulting from communication radiation and power dissipation by routing data through multihop. The basic idea is to organize implant sensors into cluster and route data using SAR minimization metrics. These can be considered as an extension of energy efficient routing in general WSN The experiment and analysis in section III and IV confirm that in-body propagation attenuates rapidly than on-body propagation. It is especially true for the 2.45GHz radio. We compare the relative path gain of on-body and in-body in Fig. 5 using the phantom result of Table II and Eq. 2. In both frequency, the difference in relative path loss increase with distance. It is intuitive to select body surface coordinator as a message forwarder in the multihop implant sensor networks to exploit the path loss difference. The data packet from implant sensor first goes to the on-body forwarder and is then forwarded back into body to the destination implant. Figure 6 compares the two network architectures. Implant devices are put inside of body only when they are source or destination of information, not for the purpose of data forwarding. This network structure coincides with the scenario considered by 802.15.6, where there is always an externally worn coordinator which is outside of body.

Conclusion This paper presents a new network architecture for the long range communications in implanted sensor networks by introducing a body surface coordinator. We measured the on-body radio propagation around the body surface and in-body propagation through tissues in 403MHz and 2.4GHz. We have found that the in-body propagation loss is much more than that of on-body propagation, especially in the 2.4GHz. And the path loss difference increases with the propagation distance. We therefore propose to introduce a body surface coordinator to the implanted sensor networks. Instead of only routing data among implants, the coordinator on the body surface can forward data from one implant to another over long distance more safely and efficiently. Other benefits of body surface coordinator include more power resources, management freedom, and less risk and expense Acknowledgement The authors would like to thank Prof. Jun-ichi Takada, Dr Hirokazu Sawada and Norihiko Katayam for the experiments REFERENCES 1  M.

It was showed that this approach reduces significantly the number of news that is returned to users The future work will incorporate new data killing patterns and use more autonomic characteristics cited on this research. Besides, we also intend to improve the collaboration among autonomic data, allowing that user behavior patterns be also shared and recommended in an autonomic way

The top rectangle contains modules that interface to application systems such as Automatic Logistics, Decision Support Systems \(DSS environment factors and spatial frailty. Spatial frailty \(Ma 2008a distribution is important for the underlying physical system  Dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Ma and Krings 2008e Ma 2008a is briefly introduced in the previous subsection. Dynamic hybrid fault models makes modeling of failure modes various failure behaviors such as malicious vs. benign asymmetric vs. symmetric, transmissive vs. omissive realistic and allows real-time prediction of fault tolerance levels. They will be revisited in Section 4  Survivability has been researched and advocated since the late 1990s \(Ellison et al. 1997, Liu &amp; Trivedi 2006 However, its practical implementations have been slow particularly in PHM. In particular, few systems have implemented survivability with quantitative models. It appears that this slow adoption is related to a fundamental difficulty that survivability was devised to address: dealing with malicious or catastrophic failures. The difficulty lies in the reality that it is usually extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine the occurrence probabilities of the malicious or catastrophic events. This has been the case even in the field of large scale computer networks that controls critical national infrastructures where survivability was initiated. The Three-layer survivability analysis was an attempt to address this challenge \(Ma 2008a 5 The new architecture puts survivability in the focus, and survivability is largely equivalent to sustainability in current PHM. The focus of survivability is tuned to the handling of UUUR \(Unpredictable, latent, Unobserved or Unobservable Risks catastrophic events, as well as many security breaches UUUR events present significant challenges for existing reliability and PHM because it is often impossible to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events When UUUR events are involved, the new architecture uses survival analysis to analyze the consequences of UUUR events, and introduces the evolutionary game theory and the principle of hedging to determine the sustainable strategies or the evolutional stable strategies \(ESS EGT. The sustainable strategies, if implemented and executed based on a duo of survivability \(sustainability metrics, can protect a system from the consequences of UUUR events such as catastrophic failures  When UUUR events are not implicated, the new architecture is much simplified and is similar to existing PHM in many aspects. Even without the existence of UUUR events, which seems rare in practice, the new architecture still possess a few significant advantages. For example survival analysis is better off when the objects are of population nature \(many monitor sensors vs. a few components censored failure data \(incomplete failure observations unique advantage  Evolutionary game theory not only provides a modeling tool to integrate lifetime, reliability, and dynamic hybrid fault models under a unified modeling framework, but also greatly facilitate the practical implementation because evolutionary game model can be conveniently computed with evolutionary computing algorithms such as multiobjective genetic algorithms  2.4. Security and Safety Policy Enforcement 


2.4. Security and Safety Policy Enforcement  PHM may not be the best place to implement security technologies, but it can be one of the best places to enforce and implement security policies. For safety and security demanding physical systems such as nuclear power plants or weapon control systems, the enforcement of security at PHM level may be mandatory because failures can affect security and safety even if there is not any human initiated security breaches.  In these cases, safety, security, and reliability overlap partially, and security and safety must be considered  Since the US adopts a policy that atomic knowledge is born classified \(Anderson 2001, 2008 is based on the published monograph by Anderson \(2001 chapter 11, 2008 chapter 13 2001 2008 of the command and control of nuclear weapons on the developments of security protocols and technology. This interaction is certainly bidirectional since nuclear control and command technology have stimulated and opened  a couple of new research fields in security, the most notably subliminal channels.  Anderson's \(2001, 2008 introduced authentication code, shared control schemes subliminal channels and tamper-resistant devices. It is obvious that any maintenance has to preserve the integrity and secrecy of the devices involved. This seems to be the major challenge that PHM has to address with any mission critical systems  2.5. Section Summary  Conceptual Description of the Life System Architecture  In the previous subsections, we present the major components of the new life system approach by abstracting the critical problems that PHM has to address through analogical analysis with a biological system such as an insect population  In subsection 2.1, the major objective is to establish the notion that a physical system can be abstracted into a population of objects \(components, subsystems, etc Individual has duration for each stage and lifetime and the population has emergent properties such as age structure development, survival, migration \(transfer in and out spatial structure, etc. These emergent properties equally make sense in both real life systems \(such as insect populations perspective indicates that survival analysis, competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis are ideal for modeling lifetime and reliability at both individual and population levels. The applications of these approaches have been previously published by Ma and Krings \(2008a, 2008b 2008c, &amp; 2008d 1997 and Ma &amp; Bechinski \(2008 Multiple advantages exist for adopting survival analysis over traditional reliability analysis. The top three could be the capabilities to deal with censored or incomplete observation of failure events, to assess the consequence of UUUR events, and to offer a unified approach at both individual and population level modeling. Survival analysis and its sister technologies focus on lifetime and reliability It also sets partial foundation \(evolutionary game theory is also necessary Ma &amp Krings 2008e consequences of UUUR events forms the partial foundation for survivability analysis, which was termed as tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis \(Ma 2008a detailed contents implicated in this subsection \(2.1 further expanded in Section 3  Tactical Level Modeling  


In subsection 2.2, the key objective is to introduce dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF 2008e PHM architecture. DHF is an extension to tradition hybrid fault models which are based on Agreement algorithms in distributed computing and form an essential theoretical foundation for the fault tolerance systems. Agreement algorithms study the conditions for non-faulty components to reach an agreement with the existence of faulty 6 components in a distributed system. Hybrid fault models are mathematical constraints that specify the conditions to reach agreement and are the theoretical foundations for fault tolerant system design and management. However traditional hybrid fault models lack real time notion and are discrete and static. DHF models overcome the limitation of hybrid fault models and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible and the real-time reliability assessment more realistic.  This is the first introduction of DHF modeling to PHM. The case was naturally made with the monitoring sensor network in PHM since DHF models were first developed in the context of wireless sensor networks \(Ma 2008a sensory network is important given that it should address the unreliable sensors problem \(sending malicious and asymmetric fault values to other sensor nodes also be necessary for dealing with failures in the physical system itself, rather than through the monitoring sensor network. The DHF modeling is necessary whenever the components of the physical system are dependent with each other  The DHF modeling also depends on evolutionary game theory \(EGT multiple survivor functions of different groups of sensor nodes who may possess different behaviors \(including failure modes, see Figure 2 sensor node or physical device is a game player and the survivor function \(reliability fitness game. This integration of survival analysis \(which models lifetime and reliability means of EGT not only puts lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified framework, but also raises the survivability analysis to a new level, termed strategic level by Ma \(2008 analysis only to assess the consequences of UUUR events The uniqueness of strategic level is that evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS survivable or sustainable strategies. When there is not any UUUR risk in the system, the sustainable strategies can be implemented and survivability is equivalent to reliability Nevertheless, if there is any UUUR risk in the systems strategic level modeling of survivability is necessary but not sufficient. This is because we do not know when the ESS strategies should be implemented because of the fundamental inability to predict when the UUUR events may occur. In this case, survivability and reliability are different, and a reliable system is not necessarily survivable This necessitates the next level modeling, operational level modeling, to achieve system survivability. The more detailed discussion on the DHF and strategic level modeling, or the topics initiated in subsection 2.2, will be expanded in Section 4  Strategic Level Modeling  In subsection 2.3, the general architecture of life system approach to PHM takes its sketchy shape. Figure 3 is drawn to exhibit the major modules of a PHM system and its interfaces with other applications for which the PHM may be an enabling technology. The subsection also briefly introduces each module and their implications to the overall goal of a PHM system, with focusing on the two modules that are not widely adopted in existing PHM system, DHF models and survivability.  In addition, the subsection 


models and survivability.  In addition, the subsection continued the discussion of survivability in previous subsection, i.e., when UUUR events are involved, a third layer  operational level modeling is necessary.  At the operational level, to circumvent the inability to predict the occurrence of UUUR events, the principle of hedging is adopted by introducing a duo of survivability metrics expected survivability and threshold survivability.  The duo of metrics helps to implement sustainable strategies promptly and protect a system from possible UUUR events such as malicious acts or catastrophic failures.  This new approach requires neither the knowledge of the probabilities of UUUR events nor an assignment of subjective probabilities to the events.  Section 5 discusses the operational level modeling as well as the remaining issues set to discuss in this paper  Subsection 2.4 explains that the new life system approach can conveniently accommodate security policy because majority of security events at the policy level can be captured with UUUR events. The point is that maintenance may "break" security even if there are not any humaninitiated malicious security breaches  3. TACTICAL LEVEL MODELING AND SURVIVAL ANALYSIS APPROACHES  As indicated in the previous section, the main objective of this section is to provide mathematical tools for modeling lifetime and reliability at both individual and population level. Lifetime and reliability constitutes two of the most critical modules of PHM. The approaches we use are survival analysis \(univariate multivariate survival analysis. Comprehensive discussions of these approaches in the context of PHM and reliability can be found in Ma and Krings \(2008a, 2008b, 2008c, &amp 2008d the justifications for each approach in a group of text boxes  3.1. Survival Analysis  Survival analysis \(Box 3.1; Ma &amp; Krings 2008a for detailed discussion in the context of PHM and reliability traditional reliability analysis and lifetime modeling in PHM. Ad-hoc applications of survival analysis in reliability research were attempted in 1980s, not long after the advancement of survival analysis. However, the applications of survival analysis in reliability to date are still limited in comparison with its huge success in biomedicine where it has become a de facto standard for biomedical data analysis and modeling. Mazzuchi et al. \(1989 who advocated the use of Cox proportional hazards model in reliability analysis. Millar \(2007 introduce survival analysis approach to PHM modeling Here we only summarize the following advantages of 7 survival analysis over traditional reliability analysis with respect to the reliability analysis and PHM  1 reliability analysis possesses: e.g., reliability function [R\(t is equivalent to survivor function [S\(t used in both fields; mean residual lifetime \(MRL equivalent to remaining useful time \(RUL MRL is much more flexible  2 partial information from the censored \(incomplete observations. Censoring is almost unavoidable in failure data analysis.  For example, it is simply too expensive or unacceptable to observe the full courses of some failure events, which leads to right censoring.  Similarly, there are 


events, which leads to right censoring.  Similarly, there are left censoring, random censoring, and interval censoring Censoring creates significant challenges to traditional reliability analysis and PHM, nevertheless, much of the theoretic research on survival analysis has been focused on better addressing the censoring issues. Therefore, it can be said, when coming to dealing with censoring, survival analysis, including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis offer the best solutions  3 Hazards models and Accelerated Failure Models offer powerful techniques for modeling time and covariates dependent hazard and survivor \(reliability are much more flexible and powerful than those used in traditional reliability analysis  4 for both individual and population level modeling.

Basics of Survival Analysis  A comprehensive discussion of this topic in the context of PHM can be found in Ma and Krings \(2008a Survival analysis, also known as failure time analysis, has become a de facto standard for analyzing time-to-event data in biomedical research in the last two decades Survival analysis studies positive random variables for describing times to events in concern, also known as survival time, failure time, or simply time-to-event  Survivor Function and Hazard Function  Survivor function and hazard function are two of the most fundamental definitions in survival analysis.

This forms the foundation of tactical level modeling in the three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008  3.2. Competing Risks Analysis  Competing risks analysis \(Box 3.2; Ma &amp; Krings 2008b for detailed discussion in the context of PHM and reliability subject of survival analysis. It has a history dating back to 1760 when Daniel Bernoulli studied the risks around the smallpox inoculation. However, modern competing risks analysis draw extensively on survival analysis, which was only initiated in late 1950s but the active research was not conducted until the1970s The application of competing risks analysis in reliability is quite earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 


earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 1967 controversies around the issues of identifiability, which shadows its value when multiple latent risks are dependent.  Three excellent monographs exist for competing risks analysis \(David &amp Moeschberger 1978, Crowder 2001, Pintilie 2006 perspective of survivability analysis, competing risks analysis can be used for analyzing the effects of unpredictable risks by treating the unpredictable events as censored or the effects of latent risks We use the term latent risks to refer to potential failure risks \(but only one of the risks ultimately causes the system failure survivability analysis; this usage of latent risks is totally consistent with the concept of latent risks in competing risks analysis, where these risks are modeled precisely  3.3.

Basics of the Competing Risks Analysis \(CRA  In competing risks analysis \(CRA experiences multiple risks simultaneously, but it may fail from one of the risks only and fail only once. The risk that leads to the failure becomes the cause of the failure Therefore, risk is often used before the failure occurs and the cause is preserved for the afterwards \(Crowder 2001 failure is the defining characteristic of competing risks analysis. It also implies that the system is multivariate from the perspective of risks, but univariate from the perspective of the single failure time and single cause  There are two sets of formulations for CRA in the literature. The first is described with a pair of vectors of random variables the latent \(theoretical David and Moeschberger 1978 used below well as sub-survival functions \(Crowder 2001  There is one and only one cause in the set of k causes for each failure observed.  The elements of C are called risks before failures and causes afterwards. The risks compete for the cause. In reliability analysis, C might be faulty components in a series system and T is the breakdown time of the system; or C might be the failure modes, such as asymmetric vs. symmetric  The sub-distribution function is defined as   tTjCtjF equivalently, the sub-survivor function is defined as   tTjCtjS &gt Obviously jptjFtjS   where   jSjFjCp j represents the marginal distribution of C

Similarly Pr\(cause j | time t specific age group 9 The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multi-state modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multi-state models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and PHM. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one reference in the form of monograph, i.e., by Hougaard 2000 analysis in the context of reliability and PHM can be found in Ma &amp; Krings \(2008c 2008d frailty and multi-state modeling, respectively. Given the complexity involved with multivariate survival analysis, any description of actual model is quite involved and hard to fit in a comment box. Box 3.3 only contains a few concepts  The previous univariate survival analysis and, to a lesser extent, the competing risks analysis have several significant limitations. The first limitation is the implicit assumption of single failure or single time-to-event transition. In Figure 2 multiple states and multiple transitions are the norm, rather than the exception. This is a multivariate survival system and multi-state modeling is obviously more appropriate than the univariate or competing risks analysis. Competing risks analysis can only address the multiple risks, but not multiple failures, which further can be dependent with each other. In more general terms, multiple failures with common-events modes represent the typical failure mechanisms in a multivariate system, but both univariate survival analysis and competing risks analysis can help little in modeling the dependences This constitutes the second limitation.  A third limitation is that not all covariates are observable, and some of the unobservable or unobserved may have critical influences on the 'survival' \(or transitions between states nodes. These unobservable covariate factors may create common-risks dependences, and the shared frailty model can capture these kinds of unobservable common-risks While the capability to capture the effects of unobserved or unobservable common-risks is critical for reliability modeling, its criticality to survivability modeling cannot be overemphasized because the quantitative study of this issue does not exist in the existing survivability research Therefore, shared frailty modeling is a critical tool for studying the influences of UUUR events in the tactical level modeling of survivability  Of course, the above limitations discussed equally apply to the traditional reliability theory because traditional reliability theory is based on the binary-state logic \(either failed or operational especially of computer networks, is often characterized by 


especially of computer networks, is often characterized by the multi-state performance degradations before reaching the complete failure. This multi-state nature of reliability has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and the most significant advances have been in the field of multistate reliability modeling \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003                                                 4. STRATEGIC MODELING AND DYNAMIC   Box 3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis  Dependence Mechanisms  Dependence is often the central focus of multivariate survival analysis, and together with censoring, they complicate survival analysis most significantly. Hougaard \(2000 three mechanisms of dependence: \(i ii iii Common events are equivalent to common mode failures in reliability analysis, for example, failure events due to accidents or natural disasters. The common risks mechanism describes the scenario that the individuals are dependent due to some common unobserved risks such as common genes in siblings or a bug in the operating system that may affect all software running on 


operating system that may affect all software running on it. The third mechanism, event-related mechanism refers to the phenomena that the actual event itself changes the risk, such as virus infection of a computer node Shared Frailty Modeling  Shared frailty theory occupies the central focus of multivariate survival analysis. The dominance is not accidental because frailty captures crucial but often directly unobservable \(latent random variables, which are attributable for dependence and variations. To some extent, dependence, variation randomness, and frailty all address some facets of multivariate failure events. The frailty theory provides a unique set of approaches to address the theoretical and practical issues related to those four concepts.  Similar to the fact that censoring is the trademark feature of survival analysis \(both univariate and multivariate frailty theory is the trademark of multivariate survival analysis. These two trademark properties, censoringhandling and frailty modeling, have made multivariate survival analysis a unique and indispensable mathematical tool for biomedical and public health research Multi-State Modeling  Multi-state has been developed concurrently in several fields in the last decade, including survival analysis \(Hougaard 2000 reliability \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003 Commenges 1999 Huzurbazar 2006 multi-state modeling has been adopted to solve the domain specific problems, and the flow graph modeling offers a flexible and powerful approach to analyze multi-state models in general. Multi-State model is often formulated as Markov Process models. The transition probabilities in multi-states modeling are well defined by survivor functions \(Hougaard 2000 multi-state model is to estimate the state transition probabilities from hazards functions. multivariate system. According to Lisnianski and Levitin's \(2003 any systems that can have a finite number of performance rates are multi-state systems. Furthermore a system may consists of components which themselves could be multi-state subsystems 10 4. STRATEGIC LEVEL MODELING AND DYNAMIC HYBRID FAULT MODELS  Hybrid fault models are derived from agreement algorithms Lynch 1997 redundancy management in fault tolerance.  Therefore, the choice of hybrid fault models directly affects reliability analysis and fault tolerance. Despite the close ties between reliability and fault tolerance fields, Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e Ma 2008a with regard to the quantitative relationship between reliability analysis and hybrid fault models. To address the unrealistic assumption, they proposed a new concept  dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF mathematical tools \(survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling we first briefly describe the issues involved and summarize some of their key findings in Box 4.1  Agreement algorithms started out with the introduction of the Byzantine general problem by Pease et al. \(1980 Lamport \(1982 system are abstracted as generals of an army.  Loyal generals \(non-faulty components algorithm e.g., to attack or retreat while traitors \(or bad components others by sending conflicting messages. Because the focus of agreement algorithms is to reach agreement in the presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the 


presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
