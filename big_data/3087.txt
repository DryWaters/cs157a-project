A Finite Ranked Poset and its Application in Visualization of Association Rules Baoqing Jiang Chong Han Xiaohua Hu Institute of Data and Knowledge Engineering Henan University Kaifeng 475001 Henan China jbq@henu.edu.cn Abstract We discuss the set of all Boolean association rules By deﬁning special partial order on the set we get an isomorphism between the set and a special nite ranked poset Through discussing some basic properties of the nite ranked poset we can clearly represent the hierarchical structure of all Boolean association rules Meanwhile the Hasse diagram of the poset offers a visualization view of the structure 1 Introduction Data mining also known as knowledge discovery in 
databases has been recognized as a new very active research frontier of intelligent information processing It has successful applications in many areas Discovering association rules 1 2 i s one of the m ost a ttracti v e r esearch subjects of data mining Since the term association rule was rst introduced by R.Agrawal et al in 1993 the problem of mining association rules from large databases has been the subject of numerous studies Some of them focus on developing faster algorithms for the classical method and/or adapting the algorithms to various situations Another direction is to deﬁne rules that modify some conditions of the classical rules to adapt to new applications In  we proposed a generalized association rules model called 
weak ratio rules Given minimum support threshold ms and minimum conﬁdence threshold mc  an important subset of weak ratio rules is just an ideal o f a direct product of nite nite-chains Through investigating the structure of the direct product of nite nite-chains and the set of all Boolean association rules we come to that a special poset called nite ranked poset can clearly represent the hierarchical structure of all quasi-maximal weak ratio rules all frequent itemsets and all Boolean association rules In Section 2 we introduce the concept nite ranked poset a special nite ranked poset  m  and discuss some important properties of them In Section 3 we prove that 
the structure of all Boolean association rules is isomorphic with that of  m under a special given binary relation So the Hasse diagram of  m offers a visualization view of all Boolean association rules In Section 4 we summarizes our study and points out some future research issues 2 Finite ranked poset In this section we will present some basic concepts and results about nite ranked posets and their Cartesian product 2.1 Some basic deﬁnitions Let P be a partially ordered set brieﬂy poset  with the partial order   For and 
x y  P  we use the expression x<y to mean x  y but x   y  We use the expression x  y to mean x<y and whenever x  z  y it follows that x  z or z  y  A subset I of P is an ideal  i f the conditions x  I and y  x imply y  I  An element b of 
B  P is called a maximal element of B if there is no element c in B such that b<c  Obviously an ideal can be determined uniquely by its maximal elements and vice versa A poset P is called a nite ranked poset  called FRP brieﬂy in this paper if P is a nite poset and there exists a function r from P to the set of natural number N  r  P  N  satisfying the following conditions 1 min x  
P r  x  2 x  y  r  x  r  y   Then we say that r is a rank function 7 4 o f P  r P  max x  P r  x   which is called rank 3 4 o f P   k   0  1   r P   L k 
 P      P  r    k   we say that L k  P  or L k for short is k th level 3 4 o f P  Proposition 2.1 3 4 A Cartesian product P of nite ranked posets P 1 P 2   P m is also a nite ranked poset

 X 1 Y 1 012 becomes  X 2 Y 2 012 after a part of Y 1 is transferred to X 1 or lost Proposition 3.1   I    012 is a poset Proof We only prove the transitivity If  X 3 Y 3 012   X 2 Y 2 012   X 1 Y 1 012  then Y 2  Y 1  X 1  X 2  X 1   Y 1  Y 2   Y 3  Y 2 and X 2  X 3  X 2   Y 2  Y 3   Hence Y 3  Y 2  Y 1  X 1  X 2  X 3  X 3  X 2   Y 2  Y 3   X 1   Y 1  Y 2    Y 2  Y 3  X 1   Y 1  Y 3   Therefore  X 3 Y 3 012   X 1 Y 1 012   In the following if there is no speciﬁcation the partial order on  I  is always   Proposition 3.2 Deﬁne mapping   I    m  X Y      X  i 1   X  i 2    X  i m   Y  i 1   Y  i 2    Y  i m    then  is a isomorphism i.e  is a bijection and      I      if and only if           Hence  I  is a FRP and its Hasse diagram is isomorphic to that of  m  Proof Obviously  is a bijection We only need to prove that     X 2 Y 2     X 1 Y 1    I      if and only if           Firstly if  X 2 Y 2    X 1 Y 1   we prove   X 2  i 1   X 2  i 2    X 2  i m   Y 2  i 1   Y 2  i 2    Y 2  i m      X 1  i 1   X 1  i 2    X 1  i m   Y 1  i 1   Y 1  i 2    Y 1  i m    that is  i  I   X 2  i  Y 2  i     X 1  i  Y 1  i    Consider the following three cases 1 If  X 1  i  Y 1  i     0 1   the conclusion is obvious 2 If  X 1  i  Y 1  i     1 0   then i  X 1 and i  Y 1  hence i  X 2 and i   Y 2   X 2  i  Y 2  i     1 0    X 1  i  Y 1  i   the conclusion is true 3 If  X 1  i  Y 1  i     0 0   then i  X 1 and i  Y 1  Since X 2  X 1   Y 1  Y 2   we get i  X 2  Since Y 2  Y 1 we get i  Y 2  Therefore  X 2  i  Y 2  i     0 0    X 1  i  Y 1  i   the conclusion is true Secondly if           we prove  X 2 Y 2    X 1 Y 1    i  Y 2 wehave i  X 2   X 2  i  Y 2  i     0 1   Since  X 2  i  Y 2  i     X 1  i  Y 1  i    we get  X 1  i  Y 1  i     0 1   It follows that i  Y 1  Therefore Y 2  Y 1   i  X 1 wehave  X 1  i  Y 1  i     1 0   hence  X 2  i  Y 2  i     1 0   It follows that i  X 2  Therefore X 1  X 2   i  X 2  we prove i  X 1   Y 1  Y 2   Since i  Y 2   1 0    X 2  i  Y 2  i     X 1  i  Y 1  i    so  X 1  i  Y 1  i     1 0  or  0 1   When  X 1  i  Y 1  i     1 0   we get i  X 1  when  X 1  i  Y 1  i     0 1   we get i  Y 1  Y 2  i  X 1   Y 1  Y 2  is true This means that X 2  X 1   Y 1  Y 2   By the deﬁnition of partial order on  I   we get  X 2 Y 2    X 1 Y 1    3.2 Maximal Boolean association rules Given minimum support threshold ms and minimum conﬁdence threshold mc theset R of all Boolean association rules is that   X  Y   X Y  I,X  Y   X,Y     sup X  Y   ms conf X  Y   mc   Obviously R is a subset of  I   By properties of Boolean association rules and the partial order on  I  we know that R is an ideal of  I   L 0  I   For convenience Boolean association rule is simply denoted by BAR A maximal element of R is called a maximal BAR  The concept maximal BAR is just the concept atom association rule in The s et of all m aximal B ARs i s j ust the least set of rules in If we allow the consequent of a BAR to be empty then  X  I  X is a frequent itemset if and only if  X   is BAR In the viewpoint R is an ideal of  I   If there is k  k  0 elements in the consequent of a BAR then the BAR is called a k BAR Weuse R k to denote the set of all k BARs then R k  R  L k  I   i.e  R k is the k th level of R  R 0 is just the set of all frequent itemsets R 1 is just the set of all SAR i.e  the set of all association rules in  3.3 An Example Let D be the transactional database in Table 1 


Table 1 Transactional database  TID Items t 1 c t 2 a b c t 3 a b c t 4 b t 5 c Suppose ms 0  2 mc 0  8  then the Boolean association rules set R    bc  a    a  b    ac  b    a  c    ab  c    a  bc    If we allow the consequent of a BAR to be empty then  a     b     c     ab     ac     bc      abc   are also BARs and there are four maximal BARs  b     c     bc  a  and  a  bc  The Hasse diagram of  I  and the ideal R are shown in Fig 3 abc ab ab c ac ac b bc bc a a a b a c a bc b b a b c b ac c c a c b c ab a b c ab ac bc abc Figure 3 Structure of BARs The four bold nodes  a bc    bc a    b     c   are the four maximal BARs The bold lines the nodes connected by the bold lines and the four bold nodes constitute the Hasse diagram of all association rules The seven 0 BARs  a     b     c     ab     ac     bc     abc   correspond the seven frequent itemsets  a    b    c    a b    a c    b c  and  a b c   In the 1 th level there are ve 1-BARs  bc a    a b    ac b    a c    ab c   In the 2 th level there is only one 2-BAR  a bc   4 Conclusion In this paper what we are concerned about is not association rule mining algorithms but the mining result the structure of all association rules the Hasse diagram visualization of the structure By theory analysis and example we can use nite ranked poset  m and its Hasse diagram to study the structure of all association rules Since  m is a Macaulay poset we can discuss the Macaulay properties of the set of all association rules Meanwhile like the Hasse diagram visualization of concept lattice based on the theory of formal concept analysis we can collect some association rule nodes which have some similar relations or properties as a new virtual node and then discuss relation of those virtual nodes in a new more concise Hasse diagram Acknowledgment The authors would like to thank the Henan Innovation Project For University Prominent Research Talents 2007KYCX018 References  R  A gra w al T  I mielinski and A  S w a mi M ining a ssociation rules between sets of items in large databases In Proc of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD Int Conf on Management of Data  pages 207–216 Washington D.C May 1993  R  A gra w al and R  S rikant F ast a lgorithms for m ining a ssociation rules in large databases In Proc of the 20th Int Conf on Very Large Data Bases VLDB’94  pages 487–499 Santiago Chile September 1994  S  L  B ezruk o v  O n posets w hose p roducts are m acaulay  Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series A  84:157–170 1998  S  L  B ezruk o v and U  L eck M acaulay posets The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics Dynamic Survey DS12 2005 January 2005  G  C hen Q W e i D Liu and G  W ets Simple a ssociation rules SAR and the SAR-based rule discovery Computers  Industrial Engineering  43:721–733 2003  B  J iang Y  Xu Q  W ei a nd K W u  W eak ratio rules b etween nonnegative real-valued data in transactional database In Proc of the IEEE Int Conf on Granular Computing  pages 488–491 Beijing China July 2005  U  L eck O n t he orthogonal p roduct o f s implices and d irect products of truncated boolean lattices Discrete Mathematics  273:163–172 2003  X  LI Y  Liq J Peng and et al  The extended association rules and atom association rules in chinese Jouranl of computer research and development  39\(12 2002  X  W ang a nd M W a ng Association i nference in association rules mining in chinese Jouranl of Yunnan University of the Nationalities Natural Sciences Edition  10\(3 2001

curves which make the zig-zag movement completely uncontrollable E Chin Hiong Tan and Kay Chen Tan The entry submitted by Chin Hiong Tan and Kay Chen Tan was developed in a three-step process First the sensory information was aggregated and preprocessed second a parametrized controller based on simple rules was designed 002nally the parameters of controller were optimized using evolution strategies The resulting controller drives in the direction where the range\002nder sensors indicate the largest free distance with a speed dependent on that distance IV R ESULTS The entries were scored through a two stages process which involved three tracks available in TORCS the Ruudskogen the Street-1 and the D-Speedway The 002rst warm up stage was aimed at eliminating particularly bad performing controllers Each controller raced alone in each of the three tracks and its performance was measured as the distance covered in 10000 game tics approximately 200 seconds of actual game time For each of the three selected tracks we run each controller ten times The performance has been computed as the median the 50th percentile over the ten runs to avoid any issue about skewness Table III compares the performance of the 002ve controllers submitted to the one of the two sample programmed controllers provided by the organizers The results show that the controller submitted by Leonard Kinnaird-Heether and Robert Reynolds outperforms the other controllers in all the tracks but the Street-1 track As can be noted the performances of the controllers are highly different among the three tracks but they generally compare well to the performances of the sample controllers provided by the organizers In particular the entries submitted respectively by Leonard Kinnaird-Heether et al by Simon Lucas and by Matt Simmerson the 002rst three controllers reported in Table III performs consistently better than the sample controllers almost in all the three tracks As all the 002ve submitted controllers performed well on the 002rst stage none of them was eliminated from the second stage in which the controllers competed together in each of the three tracks In this stage the task consisted of completing three laps and each controller was scored based on its arrival order TABLE IV R ESULTS OF THE SECOND STAGE OF THE EVALUATION PROCESS  T HE SCORES REPORTED ARE THE MEDIAN OVER 10 RUNS

using the same point system used in F1 10 points to the 002rst controller that completed the three laps 8 points to the second one 6 to the third one 5 to the fourth and 4 to the 002fth one Ten runs for each track were performed using as start grid a random permutation of the competitors in order to test the reliability of the controllers performance Then the score of a controller on one track was computed as the median of the scores obtained during the ten runs The 002nal score for each controller was 002nally computed as the sum of the points collected on each track Table IV shows the 002nal scoreboard Matt Simmerson won the competition with 26 points followed by Leonard Kinnaird-Heether et al with 22 points by Simon Lucas with 20 points by Tan Chin Hiong with 15 points and 002nally by Diego P 264 erez 14 points This results suggest that although the controllers submitted by Kinnaird-Heether and Reynolds is fast the one submitted by Simmerson is more reliable especially in the presence of other controllers Finally it is worthwhile to underline that the second stage of the evaluation process suggested that all the submitted controllers have poor overtaking and obstacle-avoidance capabilities whereas these features are very important to succeed in a racing competition Additional results and a video with the highlights of the competition are available on the webpage of the competition The reason Simmerson's controller won over KinnairdHeether and Reynold's was probably that the latter had been optimized for racing on tracks with smooth curves in the presence of other cars Simmerson's controller had been trained on the 223G3\224 track that included sharp turns like Ruudskogen but on its own Both of these controllers were optimized with stochastic algorithms and it stands to reason that such approaches outperform the hand-tuning used by Lucas V T HE FUTURE OF THE CAR RACING COMPETITION While this competition differed greatly from the competitions organized during 2007 in that a more sophisticated racing game was used there was also a great deal of continuity Not only in that some of the participants of the 2007 competitions also participated in the current competition but also in the similarity of rules and arrangements The organizers believe that this continuity is very important for the competition to be successful We need a high participation level to ensure that a broad spectrum of approaches are represented and regular repetitions of the competition to ensure that the participants have time 


to perfect their approaches Our aim is to ensure further continuity through holding a series of future competitions using gradual re\002nements of the rules and software used in the current competition The following improvement will be made to the software in time for the CIG competition 017 The installation process will be streamlined 017 Reliability will be improved 017 Support for multi-car and multi-track training will be added making it easier to apply co-evolution and incremental evolution 017 More sample controllers and trainers e.g temporal difference learning trainers will be supplied An amusing illustration of the need to improve reliability is that in an early version of the software it was possible to achieve the 002tness value of driving a whole lap simply by slowly driving up to and passing the start line the car starts 100 meters before that line then turning and passing the line again This 003aw is inherent in TORCS presumably because its developers never thought of anyone doing something so bizarre Evolutionary algorithms however are good at coming up with bizarre solutions and Matt Simmerson's algorithm quickly evolved a controller that exploited this bug A patch for this bug is now part of the software package A reviewer of the paper summarizing the previous car racing competitions pointed out that in its current form the competition is not only about learning algorithms It is certainly possible to hand-code a non-learning controller that outperforms the best CI-based controllers Indeed the best controllers that come with the TORCS game developed by the TORCS developers are non-learning and by far outperform all the controllers submitted to this competition so far though they often access information state information that is not directly available through the competition API Of course we hope that future editions of this competition will see CI-based contributions that perform better than the best hand-coded ones and there are no reasons why this should not happen Still it would be interesting to run a version of the competition that compared only the quality of the learning algorithm One way could be to de\002ne a standard e.g neural network-based controller architecture and then provide an interface for a learning algorithm to set the parameters for this controller optimally given a certain numbers of laps around an unknown track The participants would then submit an algorithm rather than a controller to be run and evaluated by the organizers of the competition Another interesting version of the competition would be one where the controllers where presented with a richer but more primitive state description in particular visual data This could come in the form of the full rendered 3D view through the controlled car's windscreen or a part of it Such a state description would ultimately give the controllers more information and thus allow for better driving but would also require more complex controllers Given the various interesting variations on the car racing concept that are possible our plan is to organize editions of the car racing competition in conjunction with several international conferences and at each conference hold both the competition in its original form and some variation on the concept like the ones suggested above VI C ONCLUSION We have described the organization rules and software of the car racing competition in the form it was organized in conjunction with IEEE WCCI 2008 Four out of 002ve participating teams described the architecture and training of their controllers We have also reported the scoring procedure and results of the competition and plans for future competitions We hope that this paper in addition to serving as a record of the competition will provide organizers of similar competitions with inspiration and insights and that the descriptions of the controllers will be useful for researchers working on learning vehicle control in general and for participants in future car racing competitions in particular R EFERENCES  J T ogelius S M Lucas H Duc Thang J M Garibaldi T Nakashima C H Tan I Elhanany
