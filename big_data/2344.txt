Cloud computing\nemphasizes increased utilization and power savings through\nconsolidation while MapReduce enables large scale data analysis.\nThe Hadoop framework has recently evolved to the standard\nframework implementing the MapReduce model. In this paper,\nwe evaluate Hadoop performance in both the traditional model\nof collocated data and compute services as well as consider the\nimpact of separating out the services. The separation of data\nand compute services provides more ?exibility in environments\nwhere data locality might not have a considerable impact such as\nvirtualized environments and clusters with advanced networks.\nIn this paper, we also conduct an energy ef?ciency evaluation of\nHadoop on physical and virtual clusters in different con?gura-\ntions.

INTRODUCTION\nOver the past years the amount of data generated by\nscienti?c as well as business applications has experienced an\nexponential growth. For instance the Large Hadron Collider\n\(LHC  Facebook is already processing over 500\nterabytes of new data daily [2].\nCloud computing environments and MapReduce [3] have\nevolved separately in the last few years to address the need to\nprocess large data sets Cloud computing environments lever-\nage virtualization to increase utilization and decrease power\nconsumption through virtual machine \(VM xed-size\nchunks which are processed in parallel. Several open-source\nMapReduce frameworks have been developed in the last years\nwith the most popular one being Hadoop [4]. While Hadoop\nhas been initially designed to operate on physical clusters,\nwith the advent of cloud computing it is now also deployed\nacross virtual clusters \(e.g., Amazon Elastic MapReduce [5 the\nintegrated environment are still not well investigated.\nIn this paper, we explore two Hadoop deployment models\non both physical and virtual clusters to understand their\nperformance and power implications. First, we use the tra-\nditional model of Hadoop where data and compute services\nare collocated. Second, we consider an alternative Hadoop de-\nployment model that involves separating the data and compute\nservices. Separating data and compute services is especially\ninteresting in environments where data locality might not have\na considerable impact such as virtualized environments and\nclusters with advanced networks [6].\nWe consider the effects of the deployment models on the\napplication performance \(i.e., execution time power consumption issue since data centers enabling\nscalable data analysis now require a tremendous amount of\nenergy. Several works \(e.g., [7], [8 However,\nonly one work [9] has studied the power consumption of\nHadoop applications with a focus on physical clusters, the\ntraditional Hadoop deployment model, and compute-intensive\napplications. Understanding the application performance pro-\n?le and power consumption is a fundamental step towards\ndevising energy saving mechanisms.\nOur study is conducted in realistic conditions on power-\nmetered servers of the Grid’5000 experimentation testbed [10].\nSpeci?cally, we address the following three key issues:\n• We investigate the Hadoop application performance with\ncollocated and separated data and compute services on\nphysical and virtual clusters.\n• We study the performance-to-power ratios for Hadoop ap-\nplications when executed on physical and virtual clusters\nwith collocated and separated data and compute services.\n• We analyze the power consumption pro?les of compute\nand data-intensive Hadoop applications.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

[7] \nIII. DESIGN OF ROAD TRAFFIC BIG DATA COLLISION ANALYSIS nPROCESSING FRAMEWORK \nIn this section, we present the proposed architecture of the \nroad traffic big data collision analysis processing framework. \nFigure 2 shows the overall architecture of framework. The \nframework architecture is composed of traffic event cloud, \ntraffic event elastic load balancer, distributed CEP, event nservice integration, traffic big data storage and traffic big data \nprocessing part. \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Overall Architecture of Framework \n \nA. Traffic Event Cloud \n \nTraffic Event Cloud enables users to search for traffic nevents and patterns of events within a repository for historical \nevents. Traffic event cloud processes events, thereby creating \nan index for events and correlations between events in order to \nenable an effective event search. \n \n \nB. Traffic Event Elastic Load Balancer \n \nTraffic Event Elastic Load Balancer automatically ndistributes incoming road traffic event across multiple \ndistributed CEP. It enables us to achieve even greater fault \ntolerance in our applications, seamlessly providing the amount \nof load balancing capacity needed in response to incoming road \ntraffic event. \n \nC. Distributed CEP \n \nComplex event processing \(CEP refers to technology that \nprocesses and analyzes in real time complicated and massive \nevent that are constantly generated in real world operations. \nHowever, massive events can’t process the one CEP instance nThus, we propose the distributed CEP which dynamically \ndistributes event processing load in road traffic event cloud \nenvironments to ensure an ability to operate in real time \nwithout stopping service. \n \nD. Event Service Integration \n \nWe proposed an ESB which is a highly distributed, event-\ndriven, enterprise SOA that is geared toward integration. It is a \nstandards based integration platform that combines messaging, \nWeb services, data transformation, and intelligent routing to \nreliably connect and coordinate the interaction of significant \nnumbers of diverse applications across extended enterprises \nwith transactional integrity. The ESB can provide a kind of \nmechanism which makes it easier to add new applications or \nservices. Every application is connected to the ESB, all \nservices communicate with each other via ESB.  \n \nE. Traffic Big Data Processing \n \nMapReduce comprises two main types of tasks: Mappers \nand Reducers. Initially, Mappers read the input data from the \nHDFS \(Hadoop distributed filesystem intermediary data composed of key-\nvalue pairs. These pairs are stored locally on the node running \nthe Map function and are not written to the HDFS storage. This \nintermediary output is the input of the Reducer tasks Each \nReducer is assigned a separate key range and tries to copy the \nparts of the Map outputs which have records in that key-range. \nThis phase is called the shuffle phase. Each Reducer then \napplies its Reduce function to each key-pair and stores its \noutput to the HDFS. Figure 3 shows the MapReduce pipeline. \n \n \nFig 3. The MapReduce Pipeline \n \nF. Traffic Big Data Storage \n \nHDFS provides high fault-tolerant distributed storage, \nbased on HDFS, HBase implemented the column-oriented \ntable storage for big data. In this paper proposed a distributed \nstorage model for road traffic record based on HBase. Figure 4 \nshows HBase architecture. HBase deployment applied to a \nmaster-worker pattern. Therefore, there is usually a master and na set of workers, commonly known as region servers. \nZooKeeper provides primitives such as distributed locks that \ncan be used for building distributed applications. Region \nservers create ephemeral node in ZooKeeper 8] which master \nuses to discover available servers at start and heartbeat keep-\nalive mechanism. \n \n \nFig 4. HBase Architecture \n \nWhen HBase starts, the master allocates a set of region to a \nregion server. Each region stores an ordered set of rows, where \neach row is identified by a unique row-key. As the number of nrows stored in a region grows in size beyond a configured \nthreshold, the region is split into two and rows are divided \nbetween the two new region servers. \n \nFigure 5 shows road traffic collision update system. We ndesigned using Hadoop \(HDFS, MapReduce MapReduce \nis used in aggregating traffic data and update. Traffic and \ncollision data are stored in HBase. \n n \nFig. 5. Road Traffic Collision Update System \n \nIV. IMPLEMENTATION \nWe have implemented the road traffic big data analysis \nprocessing framework. First, we aggregated flow and speed \ndata in PeMS data and aggregated collision data in TASAS \ndata. Second, we made collision analysis data by integrating \nflow, speed, collision data. Finally, we obtained collision \nprobability using the collision rate model algorithm. Figure 6 \nshows the road traffic data and collision data processing. \n  \nFig. 6. PeMS data and TASAS data  \n \nFigure 7, 8 shows speed data mapping and reducing. Select \ndata and time as key, detector ID and speed as value.  \n \n nFig. 7. Speed Data Mapping  \n \nReduce tasks received data from map tasks and sorted \nspeed data based on detector ID and then we can get the output \nresult. \n \nFig. 8. Speed Data Reducing  \n \nAlso, we made collision

The horizontal axis show the downstream speed    \n0mph to 80 mph, and the vertical axis shows the upstream \nspeed. The size of the grid cell is 5mph. The number and the \nsize of red zone in each cell represent the collision rate. These \npattern indicate that the collision rate becomes greater when \nspeed difference becomes greater between upstream speed and \ndownstream end of the section, and when congestion exists. \n \n \n \nFig. 9. Collision Probability Data  \nV. CONCLUSION \nWe implemented road traffic big data analysis processing \nframework that can be processed and analyzed quickly near \nreal-time big data. Also, for the future, this framework supports \nscalability, interoperability, extensibility. HBase, as a NoSQL \ndatabase offering, is rapidly becoming the chosen solution for \nscalable data processing.  And we analyzed collision data and \nroad traffic data on a 45-mile section of I-880N freeway CA, \nUSA. There are still several problems to solve. Besides the \nperformance impact, the framework should be evaluated from \nscalability, elasticity and utilization aspects.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis research was supported by MSIP\(Ministry of Science, \nICT&Future Planning Information \nTechnology Research Center NIPA-2013-\n\(H0301-13-1012 National IT \nIndustry Promotion Agency dkmin nkonkuk.ac.kr  El Abbadi, “Big data and cloud \ncomputing: current state and future opportunities,” in \nProceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending \nDatabase Technology.

After \nthat, the GPUClassloader will invoke the CUDA compiler to \ncompile the CUDA code to generate a shared library and load \nit into the running JVM. \nC. Directives Design \nInspired by the mechanism of OpenMP execution flow, \nwe designed this annotation based code generation approach. \nOpenMP is efficient at expressing loop-level parallelism, which \nis an ideal target for source code parallel translation. Therefore, \nthe design of the directives used for annotating parallel able \nsource code is very important. \nOpenMP directives can be classified into four categories \nas described in [17]. \(l regions. \(2 omp for, omp sections partition work among threads on \nthe GPU device.\(3 omp barrier, \nomp flush, omp critical, etc two \nsub-regions. \(4 omp \nshared, omp private, omp threadprivate etc most frequently used directives \nas shown in Table II. Directive gmp parallel and gmp parallel \nfor are used for identifying a potential parallel section. Direc­\ntive gmp sync will request a global synchronization Because \nCUDA does not support synchronization mechanism, we will \nbreak the parallel section into two sub-sections at the gmp sync \npoint. Note that, gmp sync will probably cause two memory \ncopy function calls which is inefficient in CUDA program. \nDirective gmp shared and gmp private are used to map data \nfrom CPU memory to GPU memory. These two directives \nwill be translated to CUDA memory allocation function. We nleverage the directive translation approach discussed in [17] \nand will not go into detail in this paper nTABLE II.

directives, we also encapsulate a set of \nuseful CUDA functions in CUFFT and CUB LAS libraries. \nSo programmers can invoke FFT functions or linear algebra \nfunctions directively in MapReduce program. \nD Optimization \nCurrently, we perform optimIzation on two aspects of \nour framework. One is to optimize the code generation and \nexecution workflow. The other is to optimize the memory copy \nbetween CPU and GPU. \nInorder to integrate the GPU with Hadoop MapReduce, \nwe have designed a new class loader called GPUClassloader. \nThis class loader will be loaded when the machine has GPU \nand CUDA. At run-time, the GPUClassloader will call the nCUDA compiler to generate the run-time library, so that the \nnative function can be executed on the GPUs However, this \ncompilation process introduce some overhead. Because it will \nstore the generated CUDA source code to disk, invoke the \nCUDA compiler to compile the source code, generate the \ndynamic library and load the share library into the JVM. We \nobserved that, by default, Hadoop will lunch a new JVM for \neach Map or Reduce task. This could take some time for the \nJVM to startup. So we could leverage this period of time for ncompiling and building the CUDA library. Therefore, to reduce \nthe compilation overhead, we modify the Hadoop to start a new \nthread when lunching the JVM for Map or Reduce tasks. This \nthread will compile all the parallel regions in one go, so that \ncompilation, assembling and linking are shared. \nThe GPU is designed as a streaming co-processor. The G­\nPU memory system provides a higher bandwidth as compared \nto the CPU memory system. However, to transfer data between \nmain memory and GPU memory is very slow. The reason is \nthat, to copy memory \(via DMA the \navailable bandwidth considerably. Directive gmp shared and \ngmp private are designed in this framework for identifying the \ndata to be transferred between main memory and GPU memo­\nry. These two directives will be translated to relevant memory \ntransfer calls, like cudaMalloc,cudaMemcpy,cudaFree, etc. \nA basic transfer strategy is to copy all the shared data to \nthe GPU memory, and copy back the shared data that are \nmodified by kernel functions. However, not all shared data \nare required by the CPU after the kernel completes. And also, \nnot all shared data in the GPU global memory are persistent \nacross kernel calls. Therefore, not all these data moves between \nthe CPU and the GPU are needed. So we adopt compiler \noptimization technique to eliminate redundant data transfers. \nBased on our previous research on the data flow optimization \nof parallel language[IS], we find that data flow analysis and \ndata flow optimization technique can be used to optimize the \ndata transfer in our case. \nOur optimization algorithm is based on the copy propa­\ngation algorithm [19 Copy propagation algorithm will prop­\nagates the right argument of an assignment statement to the \nplaces where the left argument is used. It is used to optimize \nthe data flow by eliminating some unnecessary assignment \nstatements in the program. Following is the formalized pre­\ncondition of this algorithm. For an assignment x = y, we can \nsubstitute y for x at every use Ux of x if: 1 definition of x reaching ux, and 2 execution Firstly, we build the DAG representation \nof the program. Each kernel region is considered as a basic \nblock. Then, we calculate the data flow functions and the \nUse-Definition\(UD data flow \ninformation, like IN and OUT sets, are the input for the copy \npropagation algorithm. After the optimization, all the data that \nhas no references in the kernel region will not be copied to \nthe GPU memory and all the data defined or modified in the \nkernel region has no further references after the kernel region nwill not be copied back to the CPU memory. Our experimental \nresults show that this data flow optimization is able to reduce \nmemory transfers sufficiently. \nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of Lit frame­\nwork in comparison with its CPU-based Hadoop framework \nusing three typical algorithms: Matrix Multiplication\(MM FFT experiments were performed on four xS6 servers.

CONCLUSIONS nMotivated by the requirements of the high performance \nprocessing of big data, we have proposed the Lit, a Hadoop \nbased high performance big data processing framework that \ncan be used for data-intensive and computation-intensive ap­\nplications. Lit integrated GPUs with regular Hadoop cluster, \nwhich leveraged both the scalability of Hadoop and the high \nperformance of GPUs. Lit is composed of a set of directives, an nextended Java compiler, a GPUClassloader and an Optimizer. \nThe programmers annotate the Java based Hadoop source code \nby the directives to specify the parallelable codes. Lit will then \ntranslate the annotated codes into CUDA codes, which will be \nloaded by the GPUClassloader and executed on the GPU. Our \nexperimental results show that the Lit framework can yield \nmuch better performance improvement over Hadoop. With the nincreasing of the data size, the performance speedup is getting \nhigher, because the overhead introduced by the compilation \nand GPU initialization is getting negligible compare to the \ncomputation time. \nIn the current implementation, we have optimized the data \nflow to eliminate the unnecessary data transfers between CPU \nmemory and GPU memory. This can effectively improve the \nperformance of our framework. Meanwhile, we have 


also \nobserved that if some data transfer instructions can be com­\nbined into one instruction, the data transfer will be efficiently \nreduced. Thus, part of our future work will be to study \ninstruction scheduling based algorithm to optimize the data \ntransfer between CPU and GPU. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their \ninsightful suggestions.

If there is any \nsecurity concern it will show in alert section and display as nsecurity warning alert.  \nTotal Tourist Efficiency index is reflecting the investment \ncapability of a tourist. This index makes clear how efficient a \ntourist as a whole for a purticular client.  \nTotal Efficiency Index = \(Visit Index + Health Index + \nWealth Index + LifeStyle Index Indexes are defined for group of \ntourists of same criteria. Criteria can be age, gender, country \nof residence, ethnicity etc. This is a good indicator to \ncompare individual tourist efficiency with that of the average \nof each criteria he belongs to.  \nAverage Efficiency Index = \(Sum of Total Efficiency \nIndexes of tourists \nBuying pattern is the buying frequency and amount spent in \nwhich a tourist purchase goods or services in a period of time \n \nVI. TESTING  \nOne of the major problems in much invested big data \nprojects is the lack of confidence due to non-practical results. \nTherefore a sound quality control, using standards and a nquality check with comparison testing of results with real web \nsites is very important. During the testing three dimensions \n\(volume, variety and velocity  need to be tested. Test plan has \nbeen proposed as follows;  \n \nA. Validating based on the characteristic of big data \nTesting high volume of data is very complex task and \nneeds faster approach. Testing approach needs to carry out by \nusing number of datasets sampling strategy based on the data \nrequirements. These Structured data needs to test by \ncomparing data using compare tools. Therefore data \ndiscrepancies can be identified Converted semi structured \ndata into structured format since data crawling from different \nwebsite to the dashboard it does not have defined structure to \nvalidate. Subsequently validation should carry out by ncomparing expected data with actual data. There is no define \nformat for unstructured data like social media data, web pages, \nweb log files, search indexes, e-mail, documents. It converted \ninto structured data by using Pig scripting [43] and validated \naggregated data against the data output. Performance testing \nneeds to be out in order to test data speed.  \nB. Functional Testing  \n1 During the \ntesting incorrect data can be captured when loading source \ndata files into HDFS.  Therefore it needs to initially validate \nthe data requirement and compare the input data    file and \nsource data including social data, streaming data, and \nstructured data from OLTP database. Subsequently needs to nvalidate that whether the data files are loaded into HDFS \nappropriately.  \n \n2 Coding issues in map \nreduce jobs can be occurred therefore developers needs to \nhighly concentrate to identify and fix issues. Business logic, \nData process, map reduce process, aggregation, output files \nand file format need to be validated during this phase.  \nThis solution heavily involves java code. It is important \nthat code is written according to java standards and best \npractices to ensure proper functioning of the application. Java \nunit testing of this application is out of scope.  \n \n3 storing phase: Once the data \nfrom data sources loaded in to HDFS and map reduce process \nis completed processed data will move to this phase. Data \ntransformations are very complex and it needs more \nprocessing time. Validation needs to consider in terms of data \nintegrity and data quality. Hence transformation rules and \naggregation of data needs to be validated.  \n    This solution involves inserting and selecting of data from \nNoSQL databases like Hbase. Still there are no hard and fast \nstandards and best practices for NoSQL based data operations. \nEven though it is in the very scope of this paper the time \nfactor has not enabled authors to explore much on this area. \nAuthors plan to explore standards and best practices of \nNoSQL data operations in a future research paper. \n \n4 whether the fetched data appeared as expected.   \nDashboard data and reports needs to be validate by ensuring nwhether web data are up to date and available. \nC. Non Functional Testing \nPerformance Testing is another main area authors need to \npay a lot of attention. Bigdata involves high volumes, high \nvariety and high velocity in data which is vulnerable for \nperformance issues if any of these attributes are changed 


nTherefore millions of data needs to be prepared and loaded \ninto the application and complete cycles needs to be test. Also \nas mentioned earlier there are different varieties of data. \nTherefore data needs to feed to the application in high speed \nsimulating a real world scenario where web pages will rapidly \nupdate. Any issues in performance will rectify from \napplication, hardware, network and other factors continuously \nto get real value from big data \nHDFS architecture is designed to detect and recover to \nproceed with in the processing for three common types of \nfailures including NameNode failures, DataNode failures and \nnetwork failures [44]. However validation should take place \nwhen switch over in to other data node to ensure failover ntesting.   \n \n \n \nD. User Acceptance Testing \(UAT nauthors did lot of work in preparing test specifications as this \nRinusha Irudeen #1and Sanjeeva Samaraweera*2  215 \n12th & 13th December 2013     2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions \(ICTer functionally fit for use and behaves as \nexpected; validate end-to-end business process, user access, \ndata availability, integrity and quality. The method of this \ntesting mainly is on comparing the end result with that of the \nsource web sites. For example let's get a person whose visit \nindex to Sri Lanka is very high Testers have to manually \naccess the web sites involved and see whether they reflect \nthese visits. Also they have to compare this with different \nusers and see whether the visit index for this user is \nreasonable compared to web published data and other users. \nIn this way all the indexes has to be tested with sample users \nand also see whether average indexes are realistic and also \nother trends are correctly shown in web nVII. DISCUSSION \nAs discussed in the paper this research was based mainly \non the end users like tourist hotels and tourist guides etc. \nTherefore it was essential that we get the feedback from them \non the solution design as well. We got their feedback mainly \nfrom the dashboard prototype which was a very good tool for nthem to get good idea on our design. \nUsers were very enthusiastic on this kind of a solution. \nTheir main worry was whether they will have to pay for this \napplication. They knew that we were based on readily navailable data in internet and some of them were already \nusing some web pages to get an idea of their tourists. So it \nwas not an easy task to convince a new application. But the \nrich interface and the comparative indexes authors designed \nwere making sense to them. After looking at the return on \ninvestment most of them were happy on this venture. \nOne of the main valid points was whether we can rely on \nweb data As they pointed out some of them had relied on \nthese web information earlier and had mixed results. Some ntourists sites were publishing genuine data where as some \nothers were publishing fake data which we also had to agree. \nTherefore what they were pointing was rather than relying on \ndata that is published by tourist themselves we have to go for \nsome independently confirmed data source, since they have to \nsubscribe also Authors pointed out the facility of integration \nwith the Department of Immigration and Emigration which nusers welcomed and were suggesting further to get integrated \nwith official authorities of countries of relevant tourist as well. \nThis was a good suggestion and authors think this is possible \nif they can get the sponsorship from government of Sri Lanka \non this venture. \nBigdata solutions mainly go hand in hand with ndatawarehousing solutions. Software companies market them \nas cheap options for datawarehousing due to the open source \nstack it uses. But penetrating into the market with this \nstrategy is difficult when there is an existing datawarehousing \nsolution. Client thinks he already has the given solution using \nthe datawarehousing data and if he has already spent on \nsoftware he may not be interested in going for a new solution. \nDue to this problems in penetrating into the market with \ndatawarehosing solutions authors came up with this novel nidea of integrating bigdata solutions to On Line Transaction \nProcessing Solutions. Rather than marketing this as a \nManagement Information System authors are proposing to get \nadditional data using this solution for front office transaction \nsystems. \n One of the main attractive points in this solution is rather \nthan working on historical data of the available databases \nauthors is going for social media to explore additional and \nindependent data. This was the main key factor in introducing \nbigdata into tourist sector as this impressed the tourist \noperators. Even though this data is known to the end user they \nreadily accepted the way authors were trying to analyze this. \n Even though bigdata is a buzzword the use of it is very \nlimited and this a practical solution design which will attract \nusers to use this technology. \nAuthors' idea was to implement this solution design before \nthe ICTer conference for the presentation. But due to other \nfull time commitments they did not have time to show a fully \nexecutable prototype of this solution. Especially both authors \nbeing database specialists it was no easy task for them to start \non a venture of a java based project. Therefore the solution \nwill be limited to the total solution design with fully tested \nhadoop and hbase components. \nWe would have validated the data files in different data \nnodes in order to complete the validating process during the \ndata crawling and scraping phrase. In the testing, we mainly \ntested standalone 


node only. Different issues may occurred \nwhen validating the map reduce process run on multiple \nnodes nVIII. CONCLUSIONS \n In this paper we proposed a solution design for a \ndashboard which is integrated with big data technologies. \nDifferent types of big data technologies were analyzed and \nidentified. After evaluating stakeholder requirement and \npossibility of implementation proposed solution were \ndesigned based on Hadoop nFour fusion logics were applied to design main index \nindicators. Index Indicators, Contextual Search Centralized \nrepository for user Meta data, Early Warning Alerts, Analytic \ntool and Reports, Marketing campaign optimization, Link \nwith social media features, Sales and marketing forecasting \nare the main functionalities will be embedded in the proposed \ndashboard.  \nThe proposed personal dashboard enriches with ncustomized features and enables end user to get summarized \ninformation about a tourist from different sources. On other \nhand it is very useful to take decisions in various aspects. The \nconcept has been applied in one of Sri Lanka’s most \nemerging industry named, travel and tourism to show the \npracticality of this technology to anybody. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nOur gratitude is expressed to Database Competency \nExcellence Group DB-CEG POC expertise coding knowledge in implementing the \nsolution. \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] T.Lock \(2012 Big Data \nrevolution.[Online].Available:http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/0\n8/big_data_revolution/ \n[2 R.Henschke. \(2009  nhttp://www.asiacalling.org/en/special-reports/after-the-war-the-hard-\nwork-begins-in-sri-lanka/1441-sri-lanka calls-for-tourism-\ndevelopment-boom \n[3] J.Manyika, M.Chui, B.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
