  Application of Distributed Oblivious Transfer Protocol in Association Rule Mining Xie Juan School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University Suzhou, China action_xj@yahoo.com.cn Zhu Yanqin School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab of Computer Information Processing Technology Suzhou, China yqzhu@suda.edu.cn   Abstract The purpose of association rule mining is to reveal patterns of kinds of knowledge that are not easy to find However, it may constitute a threat to privacy and information security, even more, seriously limit the development of the application of data mining, if we can not properly use this knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a concept of distributed oblivious transfer protocol, then propose and simulate a good safe and high efficient association rule mining algorithm with distributed oblivious transfer protocol. It can avoid the deficiencies caused by centralized data mining, and ensure that users can safely interactive statistical information but do not involve concrete privacy details, it also can be conveniently applied to business management and business decisions Keywords- association rule mining; privacy preserving distributed oblivious transfer I   I NTRODUCTION  Along with the computer processing power, storage technology, Internet’s fast development, as well as the explosive growth of the information that people possess which has inspired people to seek for the desire of “treasures of knowledge”, and promoted the development of the association rule mining 1,2  The purpose of association rule mining is to reveal patterns or kinds of knowledge that are not easy to find However, every thing has two sides, with the development of the society and people’s attention to privacy, it may constitute a threat to privacy and information security, even more, seriously limit the development of the application of data mining, if we can not properly use this knowledge besides, a traditional association rule mining algorithm exists some shortcomings: \(1\ Regarding a database may have many branch nodes, the network transmission load is substantial, if we excavate knowledge from a central server for all data; \(2\ Relative to distributed data mining centralized data mining’s efficiency is very low; \(3\ Carrying out central excavating in the same place for all data will do harm to data privacy preserving. In view of the above questions, we have proposed and simulated a good safety and high efficiency association rule mining algorithm with distributed oblivious transfer protocol 3, 4  In this algorithm, it not only can avoid traditional drawbacks of centralized data mining but also can find all global frequent itemsets satisfying a given support threshold under the condition that each site can not obtain others privacy. In order to ensure that all participants can safely interactive statistical information but do not involve concrete privacy details, such as the content of the database, size local frequent itemsets, local itemsets thresholds and so on we need to do the following works: each site adds a random number to each local frequent itemset of his own so as to get corresponding surplus thresholds; all participants carry out n r DOT m k     protocol; each site subtracts the random number that he has added, then sends the final result to R; R decrypts it and finds all global frequent itemsets satisfying the given support threshold II  T ERMINOLOGY AND P RELIMINARIES  A  Association Rule Mining Association rule mining 5,6 is the process involving the discovery itemsets that frequently co-occur in a transaction database so as to produce association rules that hold for the data Assume that a large transaction database D is distributed to n sites    2 1 n S S S and those local transaction databases located in these sites are denote as     2 1 n D D D where  2 1 n D D D D 000 000 000 002  and i D locates in the site n i 1  003 003 i S  Let     2 1 n i i i I  be a set of literals, called items where   2  1  m k i k  may be goods in shopping basket or insurance customers. Let     2 1 n i T T T D  be a transaction database, where each transaction i T contains a set of items from I such that I T i 004 A unique identifier TID stands for transaction id\ is associated with each transaction.

  Definition3: We assume that sup  X and i X sup  are thresholds for a given itemset X in transaction database D and i D respectively \(If there are i X sup  transactions contain  X the itemset s X  local threshold is i X sup  in i S and its global threshold is   n i i X X 1 sup  sup  then we can say that X is a global frequent itemset, if      n i i D s D s X 1     sup   B  Distributed Oblivious Transfer Protocol As we are known that all OT 7 schemes not only require public-key operations, such as modular exponentiations, but also have high computational complexity, low efficiency high bandwidth consumption, which is likely to become the bottleneck in many applications. Therefore, in order to solve above questions, Naor and Pinkas 8 first proposed a distributed oblivious transfer protocol, in which the task of the sender is distributed between several servers A n r DOT m k     scheme involves three types of parties  A sender S which has n secrets   1 0  n s s It is convenient to assume that these secrets are elements in a finite field  F   A receiver R that has a set of inputs     1 0 r     where  1 0    n r   Additional m servers   1 m S S  A n r DOT m k     scheme must guarantee the following properties Reconstruction If a receiver gets information from k out of m servers, she can compute the secret   s      1 0 r       Sender’s Privacy Given any k values, a receiver can gain information about selected secrets but no information about the others Receiver’s Privacy Any coalition of less than t servers can not obtain any information the receiver has recovered where t is a parameter in the range  1 k t   The parameter t should be as close as possible to k  Receiver-servers collusion A coalition of the receiver with l corrupt servers can not learn anything about the n secrets more than can be learned by the receiver herself An additional requirement is that if the receiver gets information from less than k servers she gains no information about the n secrets III  THE IMPLEMENT OF DISTRIBUTED OBLIVIOUS TRANSFER IN ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  A  The description of ARDM DOT m k n r      scheme First of all, we need to do the following assumptions 1\he number of sites is 3  i and let 4  i in this paper 2\ All participants are semi-honest and provide true information The problem that is going to be solved in this paper is finding all global frequent itemsets satisfying a given support threshold under the condition of each site can not obtain others’ privacy. Now we will give a concrete description about this algorithm Step 1: S equally distributes the data locates in a large transaction database to m sites Step 2: Randomly select a site as the receiver R, after that, R sets the value of k and sends it to electronic bulletin board for other sites downloading Step 3: R and other sites excavate local frequent itemsets using data mining algorithm and send the mining results to electronic bulletin board Step 4: S downloads all local frequent itemsets and keeps count of the standard frequent itemsets, then publishes them to electronic bulletin board Step 5: Every site updates his own local frequent itemsets after downloading standard frequent itemsets from electronic bulletin board in order to ensure his frequent itemsets’ order is consistent with standard frequent itemsets’ \(If an itemset locates in standard frequent itemsets but not in local frequent itemsets, we will add this itemset to the right position for local frequent itemset and set its threshold is 0\, then they add a random number 012 for each frequent itemset’s threshold and send them to S independently Step 6: all participants execute n r DOT m k     protocol Step 7: After execution above protocol, R can get a set of sums of surplus threshold corresponding to each itemset in standard frequent itemsets, then sends these results     1 r E E   that are encrypted by Paillier homomorphic encryption algorithm  to one of sites i S  Step 8: The site i S deducts the random number 012 that is added in step 5 for each itemset’s threshold, when he receives message from R, and sends results         1 012  012  E E E E r   to next site until all sites have done the same operations. After that, the final result is sent to R Step 9: R decrypts a set of surplus thresholds corresponding to each itemset in standard frequent itemsets and deducts himself random number, then he will be able to judge which items are global frequent itemsets satisfying the given support threshold B  The scheme of n r DOT m k      At present, the study on 1-out-of-2 distributed oblivious transfer protocol has a lot and is going to be perfect, but for the general form of the n out-of r distributed oblivious transfer protocol has not given a description in detail. Now we will propose a n r DOT m k     scheme bases on a n DOT m k 1     scheme Let 1 0   n s s are sums of surplus thresholds corresponding to each itemset in standard frequent itemsets In this paper, considering the requirement of finding all 
205 


  global frequent itemsets that meet given support threshold we not only need to let the number of R’s choices is equal to the number of the standard frequent itemsets, in other words satisfying n r  but also we need to ensure that all participants can interact with each other, namely m k   Initialization Phase 1\ generates 1  n random polynomials     1 1 x B x B n  of degree l and one random polynomial   0 x B of degree 1 1     t l k with values in  F such that 0 0  0  s B  and for  0   0   1  1 0 i i B B s n i      2\ constructs a n variant polynomial     1 1  n y y x Q with values in  F such that   1  0  0    0  1  0    0  0  0  1 1 0     n s Q s Q s Q More precisely      1 1 0 1 1          n j j j n y x B x B y y x Q  3\ For   1 m i  S sends the  1   n variate polynomial     1 1  n y y i Q to the server  i S  Oblivious Transfer Phase Let  1  0      1 0   n r    be the receiver’s R choices 1\ generates  1   n random polynomials     1 1 x D x D n  of degree 1  t such that  0   0   1 1  n D D is a  1   n tuple of zeroes with 1 in position     1 0 r    which corresponding to secrets positions in which she is interested. Define a univariate polynomial V to be         1 1 x D x D x Q x V n    2\ R sends the following queries with the form of               1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 j r j n j j n j i D i D i D i D i D     1 j r n i D  to the server   1  r j S j i   3\ The server j i S calculates values of r sets of               2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 j n j j j j n j j i D i D i Q i V i D i D i Q                1 1 2 j r j r n j r j j i V i D i D i Q i V    then sends the results back to R 4\ After receiving r sets of values of  V say              1 2 1 2 1 1 1 k r k k i Vr i V i V i V i V i V R interpolates        2 1 x V x V x V r and computes  0    0   0  2 1 r V V V  IV  S YNTHETIC E XPERIMENT AND R ESULT A NALYSIS  A  Synthetic Experiment To further test our scheme can have high efficiency and robustness of the mechanism in practical operation, we design a synthetic simulation for ARDM rDOT m k n   1     and ARDM DOT m k n r       With the development of bar code technology, the typical example of association rule mining is shopping basket analysis. Association rule mining is widely used in the transaction database to find patterns in different commodities items\to discovery the model of the customer’s buying behaviors, such as the effect of purchasing a commodity on purchasing others. The analysis results can be applied to shelf layout, warehousing arrangements as well as carrying out the classification according to the purchase pattern to the user and so on. Therefore, the dataset used in this experiment is intercepted from a Belgian supermarket’ real transaction records of three times during 1999-2000 years, which generates 3.9Mb transaction data according to the normal distribution. In this experiment, we have selected 400 records and distributed them equally to 4 sites The practical execution performance of two algorithms are shown in Figure 1 with support threshold is 2% and 3  k    Figure 1  Synthetic Result B  Result Analysis We will give some analyses for our algorithm from the following aspects 1\ A coalition of all sites cannot learn about R’s choices As we all know, the standard frequent itemsets are maintained by all sites in addition to the sender S, therefore except R other sites can obtain some itemsets that are the same with R’s, but can not be able to learn corresponding threshold, what’s more, they are also unable to learn whether R does have other frequent itemsets as well as their information in detail Therefore, all sites can not learn R’s choices, even if they have acted in collusion with each other 2\ny site can not be able to learn other sites information, which makes each site’s privacy to be protected In the ARDM DOT m k n r      algorithm, each site carries out excavating local frequent itemsets in their own local database, which does not involve the problem of privacy infringement. further more, all other participants are executing a distributed oblivious transfer when the receiver R determines if a itemset is a global frequent itemset or not After execution of the protocol, the receiver reveals these secrets at her choices, but obtains no information on others while the sender does not know which secret the receiver has recovered, according to the definition of the distributed oblivious transfer protocol. In addition, we also do some 
206 


  modifications for transaction information in this algorithm for example, adding a random number for local frequent itemsets’ threshold so that a malicious third party can not infer concrete information, even if he has captured some information 3\ Algorithm Complexity The main consumption of this algorithm is to be involved in the implementation of a distributed oblivious transfer protocol. The two algorithms ARDM rDOT m k n   1    and ARDM DOT m k n r      all can solve the problem that makes R can obtain all global frequent itemsets under the condition of protecting all sites privacies, but the difference only lies in the implementation of a distributed oblivious transfer scheme. Now, we will give some communication complexity and computational complexity analyses Communication Complexity Let u represent the output bits of the information that S sends to other sites v represent the output bits of R’s requiring information w represent the output bits of feedback information receiving from other sites, then we can learn that the former algorithm’s communication complexity is    w v u rm O   the later algorithm’s communication complexity is    rw rv u m O    Computational Complexity For the former, it needs to execute r times n DOT m k 1     but for the later, it only demands to execute 1 time n DOT m k 1     and 1  r times Lagrange's interpolation. Through some analyses, we can learn that 1 time n DOT m k 1     consumes less time cost than 1  r times Lagrange's interpolation, therefore, our scheme is more efficiency Based on the above, we can learn that the algorithm used in this paper is better for communication complexity and computational complexity, especially confronting massive data and the number of frequent itemsets that need to determine whether they are global frequent itemsets or not is very large, our scheme has better efficiency V  C ONCLUSIONS  Not only the network is playing more and more important role in today’s social life, but also the association rule mining is receiving more and more attention in the business management and business decisions, therefore, how to efficiently solve the problem of privacy protecting in data mining is becoming a hot spot day by day. In the view of the practical need of society and the shortcomings caused by centralized data mining, we propose and simulate a good safety and high efficiency ARDM DOT m k n r       algorithm, which not only can meet consumers' demand but also can be widely applied to business management and business decisions R EFERENCES  1  Hui Wang, and Hongjun Zhang, “Survey of the Algorithms on Association Rule Mining,” Software Guide, vol. 8, pp. 8-9, 2009 2  M.

Ontology based models can express rich semantics, but the reasoning rules of these models are too strict, wh ich cannot meet with the diversity and irregularity of web resources. Probability topic models are based on probability and statistic, where many mathematical assumptions are given. However, these assumptions are not suitable, because the web resources are massive, dynamic and uncertain To our model, text 024\020\024\020\024\013  k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k nowledge is simplified as 210  any text can be represented as 210  is the union of e human beings IV R EASONING BASED ON D EGREE 2 HYPOTHESIS OF T EXT K NOWLEDGE  According to the above analysis, especially nowledge can be represented automatically, and can accord with the mass dynamic and uncertainty of th e web resources.

From experiment verifi cation, we find that poor semantics can be extracted by VSM, but EFCM and PSR can extract more semantics from text s.  In this point, both EFCM are different companies. But the latter article tells something about planting apple tree. Just judging the content of employment; demand 4\017\r respectively.  In the two groups, there is which denotes the development supported by So, PSR expresses the difference among them very well, which is generated readily automatically by machines As similar to grou p one, there are three pages which contain some common harden their systems. Herein In page two, there is and  So, how to distinguish these pages becomes more difficult because of the lac of clue information. However, with the help of text association rules, it can be determined whether association rules, the similarity and difference among them become obvious.
