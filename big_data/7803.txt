From the viewpoint of molecular biology, cancer is a genetic disease resulting from abnormal gene expression due to DNA instability, such as translocation amplification, deletion or point mutations. The purpose of this study was first to perform functional analysis of a set of cancerous genes, and to discover or predict the other human genes that are hypothetically cancer-related. To achieve this goal, an approach consisting of three major components was proposed. Firstly, an automatic system has been developed to collect different data sets from the inter 
net, like human genes, proteins, and functional domains. Secondly, the functional domain compositions extracted from proteins were adopted for grouping the cancerous genes into a number of clusters by hierarchical clustering and association rule methods The functional domains commonly existing in a cluster of genes represented the characteristic of that cluster. A second set of hypothetically cancerous genes predicted by single nucleotide polymorphism SNP\s utilized for testing purpose. The experimental result indicated that a total accuracy of 
81.45% was reached. It is anticipates that the proposed approach can be applied to other genetic diseases with minor modification 1. Introduction Clinically, cancer is a complex family of genetic diseases due to abnormal gene expression resulting from DNA instability, such as translocation, amplification, deletion, or point mutations. These altered chromosome regions contain genes coding for regulatory factors involved in cell proliferation differentiation or death regulation, probably oncogenes in the amplified regions and tumor 
suppressor genes in lost regions. A number of oncogenes have been identified and characterized From the sequence comparison, these genes exist as families or even super families. Alternatively lies. Alternatively, oncogenes can be functionally grouped into several classes. Many of them are part of signal transduction pathways, which are growth accelerators. On the contrary, tumor suppressors are the brakes of growth. Loss of function of tumor suppressors increases tumor formation. Many tumor suppressor genes have been identified as well. Like oncogenes, however, they present only the tip of the iceberg. It is therefore necessary to develop a highthroughput approach to identify the large part of ge 
netic mutations that cause cancer, instead of using the traditional one-by-one analysis method According to the central dogma of molecular biology, as illustrated in Figure 1, DNA replication and repair are the processes that keep the genome correct and faithful from one generation to the next. In addition, DNA sequence is the genotype and carries the genetic information that is transcribed to RNA and subsequently translated to protein, which is the phenotype. In general, proteins contain functional domains that naturally up- or down-regulate gene expression. Functional domain analysis of cancer 
related genes reveals important information for mining of unknown genes that are cancer-related. Consequently, the proposed approach consists of three major components, including automatic data acquisition of relevant data sets, functional domain analysis of cancer-related genes, and discovery of cancer-related genes from the human genome. An in silico experiment for effectiveness assessment of the system was conducted by testing another set of cancer-related genes from the National Cancer Institute \(NCI\tabank. The percentage of correctness can be regarded 
as an index of goodness The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of relevant work regarding cancer research using bioinformatics approaches. The proposed method and system architecture are presented in Section 3. Some experimental results and discussions are given in Section 4 Section 5 concludes the study Proceedings of the IEEE Fifth International Symposium on Multimedia Software Engineering \(ISMSEê03 0-7695-2031-6/03 $17.00 © 2003 IEEE 


2. Related Work Nowadays, different types of available technologies can be utilized in assisting researchers to study cancer-related problems. Microarray \(Furey et al  2001\l analysis of gene expression \(SAGE Ng et al 2001\ already been used extensively in large-scale gene expression analysis. Moreover two approaches are also important to detect amplification or deletion of large chromosome regions: loss Emmert-Buck et al 1997 Kallioniemi et al 1992\ These approaches generate a huge amount of data that should be analyzed effectively and efficiently. In general, hierarchical clustering is applied to microarray data for expression analysis of cancer-related genes \(Gracy and Argos 1998; Alon et al 1999; Enright and Ouzounis, 2000 Ng et al 2001; Whitfield et al 2002\Recently support vector machines \(Vapnik, 1995\ attracted much attention in supervised classification such as tumor classification \(Furey et al 2001 Adorj·n et al 2002\ Miscellaneous methods, like self-organizing map \(Kohonen, 1990\ neighborhood analysis \(Golub, 1999\ were used for gene classification. Thorough comparisons of k nearest neighbor neural networks, support vector machines, and decision tree can be found in the literature \(Yeang et al  2001; Ryu and Cho, 2002\. The association rules approach \(Rastogi and Shim, 2002\ is also applied to the field of bioinformatics, such as gene expression classification \(Creighton and Hanash, 2002\ and protein-protein interaction \(Oyama et al 2002 Feature extraction plays an important role in classification and clustering. Amino acid composition is commonly used to represent a protein \(Nakashima and Nishikawa, 1994\ Wang et al 2001\ modified the representation to be 2-gram amino acid composition to improve the accuracy of classification. Since protein function is highly related to the conserved domains presenting in a protein sequence, functional domain composition \(Chou and Cai, 2002\seems to be a more effective representation as a sequence of 1s and 0s \(Questier, 2002; Chou and Cai, 2002 other kind of approaches is based on text categorization \(Kwok, 1998; Joachims, 1998; He et al 2000 Tong and Koller, 2001\ne and/or protein annotations in textual format In the previous work \(Tsai et al 2003a; Tsai et al 2003b\discovering cancer-related genes relied on the analysis of LOH information presented in the literature to select chromosome regions with high potential. Genes within the selected chromosome regions were analyzed by text categorization approach 3. Materials and Methods The previous work greatly relies on experienced researchers providing domain knowledge for the prediction task of cancer-related genes. To alleviate the extent of human intervention, a supervised approach is proposed by functional analysis of verified cancer genes in advance. The next phase then performs discovering task of hypothetically cancerous genes from the human genome based on the analyzed rules. The proposed approach hence consists of three major components: automatic collection of data sets from the internet, functional analysis of confirmed cancerous genes using hierarchical clustering and association rule methods, and prediction validation of recognized genes that are cancer-related. The process flowchart, as illustrated in Figure 2, includes two process flows. The training phase drawn as dash lines starts with feeding a set of training data into the system. Upon the completion of training phase, a list of protein families is generated for the prediction phase as illustrated by solid lines. Similar to the training data set, feature extraction is performed for the set of human genes. Skipping of protein functional domain analysis, two data sets are compared to discover hypothetically cancer-related genes 3.1 Data Sets Two major data sets were collected automatically from the internet. The training data set was available from the Resources Centre INFOBIOGEN http://www.infobiogen.fr/\databank. Of 212 genes verified as cancer-related, six genes could not be retrieved from the NCBI databank due to the difference of code names or lack of information. The testing data set of cancerous genes predicted by single nucleotide polymorphisms \(SNPs\ was from the National Cancer Institute \(http://www.nci.nih.gov/\tabank. The data set contains 2834 cancer-related genes classified into one or more of 18 categories. A third data set containing more than 35,000 human genes were collected from the NCBI databank. It is expected that the cancer-related genes can be identified as many as possible from the huge data set The translated protein sequence of each gene from these three data sets was obtained as well for functional domain retrieval from the Conserved Domain Database \(Pfam v8.0\By using Reverse Position Specific BLAST \(RPS-BLAST 2.2.6\with expect value set as 10-4 for protein sequence alignment, the genes containing at least one functional domain were selected for this study. A value-added database was then constructed and updated regularly without human intervention 3.2 Functional Domain Composition Extracting representative features for each gene is of importance to functional analysis of cancerous genes. Instead of retrieving relevant annotation and analyzing the characteristics of each gene by using text categorization approach, functional domain composition was considered as an effective representation for this study. The meaning is twofold. First Proceedings of the IEEE Fifth International Symposium on Multimedia Software Engineering \(ISMSEê03 0-7695-2031-6/03 $17.00 © 2003 IEEE 


the genes with annotations have been usually studied or functionally predicted. Those genes without functional annotations, however, are more concerned Second, experienced cancer researchers are involved to construct a lexical database for keywords, and thus reduce the degree of automation Each protein selected for this study contains at least one functional domain. The order and repetition of functional domains are not considered. The problem of functional analysis of N cancerous genes can be regarded as performing clustering task in a vector space with high dimensions. A gene is defined as  1  0          2 1   ij T iM ij i i i i x x x x x X g 1 which states that a gene g i is translated into a protein X i expressed as a vector of M dimensions, and each dimension stands for the existence status of a functional domain in a protein or the so-called functional domain composition. For instance x ij 1 means that protein i possesses functional domain j The dimension number M depends on the number of unique functional domains identified from the set of training data i.e the proteins translated from the set of cancerous genes. Empirically, it is very rare that a protein contains more than ten unique domains 3.3 Hierarchical Clustering The training set of cancerous genes was first grouped into many families of genes so that each family would possess specific characteristics. Due to the lack of a priori knowledge of the relationship between cancerous genes and functional domains, the grouping task must be done in an unsupervised fashion. In addition, the number of gene families was unknown. Accordingly, hierarchical clustering was utilized because of its flexibility in presenting the level of similarity between two genes, defined as    1    j i j i X X p g g s   2         M k M k j jk i ik M k j jk i ik j i x x x x x x x x X X p 11 2 2 1            3 where equation \(3\s the Pearson correlation coefficient and i x is the arithmetic average of the M components of vector X i In addition, various linkage rules used in hierarchical clustering may yield different results, depending on the distribution pattern of data sets. The average linkage rule was utilized to avoid two extreme cases i.e single for the nearest neighbor and complete for the farthest neighbor 3.4 Association Rules In addition to the grouping task of cancerous genes, the frequency of functional domains commonly appearing in a set of proteins was studied as well. Association rules have been broadly used in many areas and can be applied to functional domain analysis as well. Functional domains presenting in a protein can be thought of as a set of items that a customer would likely purchase in one transaction where the quantity of an item is not considered. The standard Apriori algorithm was used in this study. Although the algorithm has its limitation when the number of different items is very large, the total number n of unique functional domains is manageable. Moreover, the number mi of unique domains in protein X i is much less than the total number M Numerous itemsets of different lengths were generated by giving a support criterion, and a short itemset was the subset of a long one. Figure 3 illustrates the hierarchical relationships of itemsets, where the number in a block denotes the functional domain PSSM ID The upper hierarchies demonstrate two pure families that each domain belongs to only one family, and the lower one explains a family tangling with two small families. The domains within shaded blocks belong to more than one family. For each gene cluster, a rule-naming process based on the set of common functional domains was performed manually by biologists in helping understanding the functionalities 4. Results and Discussions 4.1 Cluster Distribution The changes in name coding from different gene databanks were unified by UniGene ID and 212 genes were found and translated to proteins. After functional domain extraction by RPS-BLAST, 154 unique functional domains were extracted from the set R of 167 cancerous genes. As illustrated in Figure 4, combining the results from hierarchical clustering and association rules yields the distribution of cancerous genes in a 154  167 matrix and each column represents a gene g i containing at least one functional domain x ij For convenience, a column is expressed as g i x ij and marked in black in the figure. In reality only the g i x ij relationships were stored as pairs of the form {gene ID, domain ID} in a database. The distribution of the set R in the figure can be partitioned into four sets by simple queries such that    1 1    1 1    1 1   1 1 1 1 1 1 III II I IV N k kj M k ik ij i III N k kj M k ik ij i II N k kj M k ik ij i I R R R R R x x x g R x x x g R x x x g R                       4 where i  1 N and j  1 M The first constraint forces the genes in the sets R I and R III to have only one unique domain, and allows the genes Proceedings of the IEEE Fifth International Symposium on Multimedia Software Engineering \(ISMSEê03 0-7695-2031-6/03 $17.00 © 2003 IEEE 


in the sets R II and R IV to possess multiple unique domains. Similar to the first constraint, the second one indicates how many genes have a common domain j  Hence, there are no two genes in the sets R I and R II holding a common domain. The rest of genes not satisfying both constraints are categorized into the R IV set. In Figure 4, the sets R I and R II contain 35 and 20 genes, respectively. The third set comprises 24 genes grouped into 11 small clusters, and each gene cluster has one unique functional domain in common. The situation in the set R IV is somewhat irregular. There are 88 genes grouped into 26 clusters, and each gene cluster possesses partial functional domains in common In essence, the major domains commonly existing in a cluster dominate the idiosyncrasy of a gene family. Zooming in on the set R IV demonstrates clearly the problematic clusters, as shown in Figure 5. After manual examination of clustering result based on domain functionality, seven genes were misclassified. These genes were compared with the other similar ones to find the common functional domains, which were actually not the major domains of the clusters. RBTN2, for instance, is similar to one gene in Cluster 4-7-2 because of a common domain This domain, however, is not significant in that cluster. Setting the threshold value of Pearson correlation coefficient as 0.7 resulted in an elimination of these genes and generated 32 small families of genes in this region. The removed genes should be classified into separate clusters 4.2 Rule Generation A rule r i in this study stands for a set of unique functional domains, including the case of only one domain, and is defined as    1    M j x r j i  5 where x j is a functional domain. Different from the previous notation, the double subscript is replaced with a single one for generality i.e a domain does not specifically belong to a gene. Totally 55 rules were generated from 55 genes in the sets R I and R II  Moreover, 37 rules were generated from the third and fourth sets, and each rule denoted a set of major domains commonly existing in an individual cluster of genes. Consequently, family naming for each rule was based on the major domains. Table 2 lists the family names annotated manually and the associated major domains of clusters. Finally, 92 rules consisting of at least one functional domain were obtained for exploring the human genome and predicting hypothetically cancerous genes. Note that 28 out of 154 domains were eliminated during the rule generation process because of their insignificance in the clusters and the reduction rate of functional domains was around 18.2%. It is understandable from the dispersive pattern depicted in Figure 4 that cancer development is a complex mechanism involving a number of genes with different functionalities 4.3 Effectiveness Assessment The effectiveness of the generated rules was assessed prior to discovery of cancerous genes from human genome. The second set of hypothetically cancerous genes identified by single nucleotide polymorphisms was obtained from the National Cancer Institute and used for testing the rules. Due to the nature of supervised learning, 690 genes containing at least one of the 154 domains extracted from the training set were selected for assessment. The result indicated that 562 of the selected 690 genes could be recognized as cancer-related by the 92 rules generated from the previous step. The total accuracy was about 81.45%. Moreover, 96 of 562 cancer genes were also included in the training data set, and hence the rest of 466 genes were regarded as being predicted. Table 3 shows the detail information. Note that some genes might belong to multiple categories The bar chart in Figure 6 demonstrates a comparison of 18 categories having genes recognized as cancerrelated genes by the 92 rules. The last eight categories might not be statistically meaningful because of fewer genes to be examined 4.4 Cancer Gene Prediction The ultimate goal of this study was to explore cancer-related genes in human genome. To perform prediction of cancer-related genes, 13662 of 35081 genes with functional domains were obtained from the NCBI databank, and 3539 of 13662 genes containing at least one of the 154 functional domains from the training data set were selected for examination by the 92 rules. The result indicated that 2459 genes i.e 69.48%, were predicted as hypothetically cancer-related genes by these rules. Due to the lack of further information, these genes were retained for laboratory verification 5. Conclusion In this paper, a supervised approach for highthroughput analysis of functional domains and prediction of cancer-related genes has been proposed. It is anticipated that there exist strong relationships between specific functional domains and cancerous genes. Accordingly, this proposed approach is unsuitable for those genes having no functional domains. It should be pointed out that the effectiveness of the approach lies in the sample number of training data set. The more the training samples for functional analysis, the better the predicted result. It, however still has a large room for improvement. For example adjustable weight could be introduced for iterative analysis of functional domains to facilitate the clustering. Moreover, the system with minor modificaProceedings of the IEEE Fifth International Symposium on Multimedia Software Engineering \(ISMSEê03 0-7695-2031-6/03 $17.00 © 2003 IEEE

 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simpliìed to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2  Solving for  2   l  1  we obtain  i   1  d  1  l  2   d  1 d  2  i  l  2 and  l  1   1  d  l  2   d  1 d  Translating to error tolerances we set  i   1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d for all 2  i  l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no beneìt to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are deìned over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is deìned as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is deìned as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i  Hence commonality parameter  measures the fraction of items frequent enough in one input stream to be included in a leaf-level synopsis by strategy SS 2 that are also at least as frequent globally in the union of all input streams A natural hybrid strategy is to use a linear combination of MinMaxLoad WC and SS2 weighted by   The strategy is as follows set  i 1       1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d        for 2  i   l  2  and  l  1 1       1  d  l  2   d  1 d         We term this hybrid strategy MinMaxLoad NWC for non-worstcase Commonality parameter  1 implies that locally frequent items are also globally frequent and SS2 modiìed to use  1   is a good choice Conversely  0 indicates that MinMaxLoad WC is a good choice For 0  1  a weighted mixture of the two strategies is best 2.1.5 Summary The precision gradient strategies we have introduced are summarized in Table 3 Sample precision gradients are illustrated in Figure 3 3

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
