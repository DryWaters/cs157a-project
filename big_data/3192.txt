Exploring Virtual Machine Covert Channel via I/O Performance Interference 
  
Abstract 
paper we propose vLeaker a practical covert timing channel built on ne-grained VM I/O performance interference by which VMs co-resident in storage aspect can exchange the information with relatively high transmission speed and low data error rate We evaluate our vLeaker system on Xen and VMware hypervisor and show that the maximal transmission rate can arrive at 125 bps on our local testbed Moreover the effective transmission rate ranges from 72 to 124 bps with average error rate lower than 13 under different 
conìgurations 
With the prosperity of cloud computing more and more customers start their businesses by renting virtual machines VMs from third party cloud provider e.g Amazonês EC2 platform instead of b uilding their own computing infrastructure Besides the beneìts e.g cost saving high availability convenient management brought by system virtualization through resource consolidation the isolation weakness in physical resource sharing e.g CPU Memory Bus and I/O system opens doors to various kinds of security attacks 
1 Introduction 
especially the timing channel threat 2 3 4 5 As is well known timing channels nearly exist in each system which provides service via resource sharing Once a kind of resource is shared there are at least two parties simultaneously accessing such resource And the key reason which causes the timing channel 5 is that one party named as information 
Carrier Observer 
 inîuences the access time observed by another party named as information  then the Observer can deduce or extract the information from the 
Carrier via the variance of observed time There are two kinds of timing channels i.e covert and side timing channel When the information Carrier and Observ er negotiate with each other a covert timing channel is constructed On the other hand if the information Carrier does not know the existence of the Observer this is a side timing channel i.e the Observer monitors its time on accessing the shared resource in order to infer the resource access patterns of the Carrier Obviously timing channels violate the designed security policies 
of the computing systems and it should be mitigated to prohibit information leaking Since 1990 there are great efforts in system research area to explore or prevent the timing channels 9 10 and the battle continues in cloud era Recent research works show that different timing channel attacks are explored in cloud environment For example malicious tenants can explore the CPU cache based side channel for private key extraction 2 Soon after that several approaches are provided to address the CPU cache based timing channel on vir 
tualization platforms such as CPU cache usage detection and measurement CPU cache partition 12 by dynamic page coloring CPU cache non-sharing via system level protection and etc Meanwhile Wu et al also e xplores a practical memory b us based covert timing channel among resource sharing VMs Undoubtedly CPU cache and memory bus based timing channels are valuable to exploit due to common CPU and memory bus sharing situation and the high data leaking bandwidth In this paper we would like to explore I/O based 
covert timing channel in virtualized environment i.e to construct a covert timing channel among storage co-resident VMs VMs which share the storage resources by performance interference Although VM I/O based covert timing channel is less powerful than CPU and memory based approaches it is still deserved to explore and can be used as an alternative choice when existing methods are not applicable Compared

with the previous approaches VM I/O timing channel does not mandatorily require that VMs are co-resident in the same host server The only premise is that those VMs share the I/O resources i.e their virtual disks are put in the same storage system Our proposed methodology can be applied into the following scenario i.e VMs do not share the CPU DRAM resources but only the I/O resources In reality VDI virtual desktop infrastructure application is in such scenario as in most cases that the disks of those VMs are managed in the centralized storage system which provides the possibility to explore the I/O timing channel Currently we focus on how to construct the I/O covert timing channel through VM I/O performance interference Generally I/O performance variation of a VM is caused by the I/O contention by other coresident VMs Though great efforts 14 15 16 17 are applied into I/O scheduling aspect on the virtualization platforms for enhancing the performance fairness among VMs the I/O performance isolation is still not perfect which brings the opportunity to VM I/O performance interference attack Once there is performance interference from other VMs the I/O execution time of the workloads in the VM can be greatly increased compared with the case when there is no performance interference Derived from the execution time variation of VM I/O workload between interference and non-interference environments we can construct a simple information leakage rule described in Section 2.1 to exchange one bit information in a designated time window By extending the basic information exchange rule we build an information leaking system vLeaker which can be utilized to exchange the information among storage co-resident VMs To summarize we have made the following contributions in this paper We propose a novel approach to construct a covert channel through VM I/O performance interference We provide a prototype system vLeaker  which can be used by storage co-resident VMs to implicitly exchange the information instead of an explicit manner e.g network connection and le sharing Moreover We evaluate our vLeaker system on VMware and Xen hypervisor to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness We discuss some approaches to prevent or detect the VM I/O timing channel in both system and user aspects The remainder of this paper is organized as belows Section 2 presents the design and implementation of our prototype system vLeaker Section 3 demonstrates the experiments of vLeaker on both Xen and VMware platform Section 4 discusses how to detect and prevent the VM I/O timing channel Then Section 5 and 6 discuss some related and future work Finally we conclude this paper in Section 7 It is a great challenge to not only explore the VM I/O based covert timing channel but also construct a reliable protocol above the identiìed channel As described our VM covert channel is derived from VM I/O performance interference thus we should rstly collect the I/O information e.g I/O scheduling and related parameters of the virtualization platform and identify the existence of VM I/O covert channel then we need to proìle the interference time window and select the appropriate interference workloads nally we have to propose a practical transmission protocol to make such channel reliable Measuring the VM I/O performance isolation is a premise to identify such timing channel Previously Yang et al demonstrate that VMs which simultaneously execute I/O operations can be mutually inîuenced on most virtualization platforms i.e with the decreasing of throughput and the increasing of I/O execution time Ideally once the quality of I/O service is not guaranteed the I/O based covert timing channel can be constructed with the following approach Supposing there are two participators i.e one sender S and one receiver R they both locate in storage co-resident VMs S and R can negotiate a xed interference time window denoted as ITW for one bit data transmission as shown in Figure 1 During one ITW S sends one bit information via selectively executing the disturbing workload Meanwhile R measures the time i.e T  on executing the designated workload and uses T to compare with the threshold time T  In such a way an information channel can be constructed The value of ITW chosen by S and R denoted with T and T  should be the same If T equals T  S in one T  can mostly inîuence the behavior of R in two adjacent T  which can greatly eliminate the deviation

However if  then S in one T  may affect the behavior of R in many adjacent T  which can result in duplicated information error e.g if S sends one bit value 1 then R may receive many 1és Vice versa if  then S in several T  may only inîuence the behavior of R in one T which can cause the losing information error e.g S sends many 1és but R only receives one 1 Also the transmission rate TR in theory has the following relationship with ITW i.e TR=1/ITW Obviously the smaller of ITW the larger value of TR For example if ITW is 10 ms the expected transmission rate is 100 bps As the value of ITW is inîuenced by the execution time of the designated I/O workload run by S and R denoted as W and W  then the value of ITW can be determined by the algorithm shown in Figure 2 The selection of W and W must satisfy the two properties i.e and  means that the execution time of W and W should be stable when there is no interference If not stable we wonêt have a convincing base to determine the value of  then R cannot precisely determine the information to be received To achieve the stability of W and W  we must bypass the cache and buffer effects in OS kernel to avoid the time difference when the same workload is executed multiple times For example when you open a le in a disk and issue the read operations e.g read fd buf 16KB the I/O latency of the rst operation is relatively long since the OS controls the disk driver to load the contents from the disk However the I/O latency of next read operations will be relatively short due to the prefetch features provided by OS kernel Generally read I/O operations are not suitable for being selected as W or W as the unstable execution time However for write operations we can make them stable through the following approaches 1 Using O DIRECT mode to bypass the kernel buffer 2 Using I/O synchronization e.g O SYNC ag to issue the write through I/O operation instead of write back operation Thus write operations are suitable to be selected as W or W  means that we must nd those W and W with low execution time thus the value of ITW can be small and the transmission rate can be improved Considering the I/O execution path and stack write operation with 4KB size is a good candidate since the basic disk transmission size is 4KB To practically and efìciently transfer the information through the VM I/O covert timing channel a simple transmission protocol is provided

The following describes the logic of S and R for information exchange  S adopts the following steps to transfer the information as shown in Figure 3 i.e 1 It slices the information le into many blocks e.g block#1,block#2,...,block#n Then some FEC Forward error correction codes e.g Reed-solomon can be applied into each block to remedy the unreliable channel Deìnitely S and R must have a pre-deìned negotiation on the coding rules 2 for each block#i S encapsulates it into pre-deìned format shown in Table 1 then S executes the designated workload W in each ITW according to the contents of block#i  As shown in Figure 4 R utilizes a state machine with three status to receive the information named as  and  In the state R continues executing the designated workload W  According to the rule if the execution time of W exceeds the T  R receives a value 1 otherwise it receives 0 When R identiìes an expected value which matches the HEAD label it steps into the state In the state R receives the information until it identiìes the expected TAIL label or the size of received data exceeds the maximal length  Once one of the two events occurs R transfers itself into the   state In the   state R recovers the information with FEC code if needed then it stores the received information into a le and nally it rolls back to the   state again and waits for the information in next round Our vLeaker system is written in C language with about 3K LOC line of codes which is mainly composed of the information detection module IDM information sending module ISM and information receiving module IRM The IDM is designed to verify the possibility of VM I/O covert timing channel via coarse-grained VM I/O performance interference Moreover it is also responsible for determining W  W and the ITW ISM and IRM implement the logic of S and R according to the transmission protocol described in Section 2.3 In detail there are following challenges to implement a practical VM I/O covert timing channel system  As described in Section 2.2 S and R negotiates a xed ITW to exchange one bit information While exchanging more information in a continuous time period it is important to maintain the stability of ITW To address such issue we utilize the timing policy e.g timer settime function in Linux to guarantee a relatively stable window as such function can accurately control the time in microsecond level  In our protocol R measures the execution time of to determine the received information As the execution time of W can be different on different virtualization platforms which means that the T has a great variation under different conìgurations In detail we argue that assigning a static value to T can not satisfy the cross-platform requirements To solve this program we use IDM to proìle and collect the execution time of W then dynamically derive the value of T  In this section we focus on verifying the effects of vLeaker on virtualization platform with our local testbed servers Table 2 shows the conìguration of our environment On each platform we deploy two VMs named S-VM and R-VM which own non-shared areas of the DAS direct attached storage disk equipped in the server In both S-VM and R-VM we deploy a program named performance interference program in the IDM described in Section 2.4 which writes the raw disk from low LBA logical block address to high LBA with designated I/O size and xed space interval i.e 8MB to avoid the spatial locality When only R-VM

occupies the platform we measure the average response time ART of operations issues by PIP Then we let SVM and R-VM concurrently execute PIP and measure the ART of operations issued by PIP in R-VM In Figure 5 VMware-non/Xen-non stands for that R-VM runs on VMware/Xen platform without performance interference VMware-inter/Xen-inter means that R-VM and S-VM concurrently conduct I/O operations on the designated platform From Figure 5 we can see that the ART of PIP in R-VM greatly increases when there is performance interference from S-VM which indicates the existence of VM I/O covert channel According to the algorithm described by Figure 2 in Section 2.2 following experiments are conducted to proìle the ITW In our experiment W and W are assigned with the same workload named as DW which writes a raw disk from low LBA to high HBA with 4KB size and a xed space interval i.e 8MB We still use two VMs S-VM and R-VM to execute DW to determine ITW As shown in Table 3 the value of ITW must exceed 9512 us on VMware platform and 7812 us on Xen platform And we can conìgure ITW as 10000 us on VMware platform and 8000 us on Xen platform Moreover we should proìle the T  which is used by R to determine the value of received information in each ITW However it is not a good practice to assign a static value to T  As the value T of W can vary in different experiments the better solution is to proìle the relationship between T and T  Currently we use the following simple formula to dynamically regulate the value of  For example the value of X can be conìgured with 1.1 on VMware platform or 1.39 on Xen platform Generally this formula is practical but not quite meaningful and we expect to improve it in the future We evaluate the transmission rate and data error rate of the constructed VM covert channel on our local testbed On each virtualization platform we still deploy two VMs i.e S-VM and R-VM to exchange the information via VM I/O interference In our experiment we conìgure each eld i.e HEAD SIZE and TAIL with 2 bytes thus the total overhead is 6 bytes Also for SIZE eld we reserve the 4 bits for error correction And we conìgure the maximal size of the DATA as 256 bytes Figure 6 and 7 show the performance and effective experiments on Xen and VMware platforms In each diagram standards for transmission rate means the effective transmission rate since we have 6 bytes overhead for data encapsulation expresses the average data error rate of the information transferred in DATA eld From the two diagrams it shows the value of TR in experiment is very close to the value in theory e.g 100bps on VMware platform and 125bps on Xen platform With the size increase of the information in DATA eld ranged from 8 to 256 bytes it shows that the value of ETR stably increases Moreover when there is no FEC code on DATA eld the ADER ranges from 10.37 to 10.45 on VMware platform and ranges from 12.35 to 12.58 on Xen platform It indicates that DATA size is not relevant with the value of ADER when there is no noise i.e the interference from other VMs Moreover the different value of ADER reîects the characteristics of different virtualization platforms Although the transmission speed of CPU

4 Discussion 
cache based covert channel is much faster about 746.8 bps shown in the transmission speed of I/O based covert channel is still acceptable since I/O devices are relatively low speed devices To improve the reliability of VM I/O covert timing channel we apply some FEC codes e.g RS code into vLeaker system to decrease the data error rate For example when transferring 223 bytes information via vLeaker system we can utilize RS\(255 223 to encapsulate the information into 255 bytes in DATA eld With such approach the total overhead is 38 bytes on transferring 223 bytes Table 4 shows the experimental results we can see that the error rates on both VMware and Xen platform are downgraded around 5 The existence of I/O covert timing channel has been revealed more than 20 years and there are several approaches 5 to mitigate such channel Ho we v er  most hypervisors 21 deplo yed as the k e y component in the IaaS infrastructure as a service layer seems not seriously considering the threat of VM I/O timing channel which gives the opportunity for such kind of attack In this section we would like to present some countermeasure techniques to mitigate the I/O timing channel in both system and user aspects The key issue causes the I/O timing channel is the weak I/O isolation of I/O resources To reduce the bandwidth of I/O timing channel the following approaches can be utilized in the hypervisor  Usually the process identiìes the information via measuring its I/O execution time However if the clocks are random then the timer interrupts generated to the process are also random thus the process cannot get the precise time information and nally makes it hard to to derive the information via time measurement For example Hu proposed to reduce the bandwidth of covert timing channels with Fuzzy time i.e the virtual interrupt periods presented to the VMs are added with the noise Such approach is implemented in the VAX kernel and the timer interrupt is uniformly distributed around 20 ms The random clock approach is useful however it also has the side effect on the normal applications which rely on the clocks for accurately collecting the timing information  The key idea of this approach is to make each type of I/O operation stable in execution time aspect i.e each type of I/O operation can have nearly stable time to complete However such approach is difìcult to achieve as we need to re-design the I/O scheduling algorithm and may abandon the normal usage of I/O related cache in the hypervisor or storage system Generally such approach is not applicable as it can sacriìce the I/O performance of the whole system Re-designing and implementing a VM I/O timing channel against system is a long-term work It can not solve all practical problems as many COTS hypervisors e.g Xen VMware ESX\(i server hyper-V or storage systems are already used in current cloud computing system To solve the legacy issue some workarounds are needed as shown in the following  The purpose of this I/O process is to disturb the I/O timing channel constructed by the cooperated VMs As the information observing VM measures the I/O

execution time in a xed ITW to identify the received information as shown in Figure 1 random generated I/O operations by the third party can make the channel noisy and the information unrecognizable When the hypervisor provides the VM disks via DAS direct attached storage a permanent disturbing VM can be deployed on the host When the hypervisor provides the storage service through the assistance of the backend storage server several processes can be deployed to conduct the I/Os in different partitions of the storage Furthermore there should be some policies to control the I/O patterns of the process in order to make the I/O disturbing effective and efìcient As described in we may have four parameters X X X  X  to adjust the I/O patterns run by the disturbing process For example we can use the following I/O pattern,i.e 4KB 50,0 50 on our local testbed Absolutely we should adjust the four features to generate different I/O patterns for the disturbing process according to the VM I/O workload on the virtualization platform Asthe I/O timing channel is caused by the I/O contentions in the I/O subsystem including the I/O controller I/O bus disk drives and etc Ideally it is hard to inîuence the usage of I/O controller and bus except the disk drives To mitigate the I/O contention ne-grained placement policies for the VM disks can be applied Generally disks owned by VMs with different protection levels should not be putted together on the same disk drives For example suppose we have two VMs named highVM and low-VM i.e the high-VM has no network access right the low-VM has free network access right If the virtual disks of the two VMs are put in the same physical disk there is a chance that the sensitive information can be transferred from the high-VM to the low-VM via I/O covert timing channel and nally such information can be spread into the external world To avoid such issue detailed placement policies of VM disks are needed The feature of sharing the physical resources provided by system virtualization has brought the beneìt to IT industry by reducing the management and operation costs but meanwhile some issues related with VM isolation are found Although the virtualization platforms can logically isolate the VMs to prevent them accessing others resources it is hard to perfectly guarantee the performance and security requirements of VMs Due to the weak isolation a series of timing channel attacks are explored as the following shows  Ristenpart et al rstly proposed the CPU cache based side channel attack in virtualized environment and demonstrated it in real cloud products e.g Amazonês EC2 platform Later more and more attack and defense work are conducted by researchers in this aspect Besides the existed hardware based methods 24 25 to defend the CPU cache based timing channel researchers proposed some novel approaches 11 13 to address the issue in the cloud en vironment In the contrary Xu et al proposed the enhanced L2 Cache Covert Channels attacks that can improve the channel bit rate they also show the limitation of CPU cache based timing channel Independent but at the same time Wu et al proposed a practical covert channel method by exploiting the memory bus  In this paper we propose a covert I/O timing channel derived from VM I/O performance interference and demonstrate the practicality in different hypervisors e.g VMware ESX Xen Compared with the Disk-arm channel presented in our approach is more feasible since we do not need to construct the timing channel from the the low cylinder level In our approach the I/O timing channel can be easily constructed by the normal processes in the storage co-resident VMs after the ITW interference timing window is identiìed To systematically mitigate the I/O timing channel we discussed and proposed several approaches in both system and user aspects e.g the limitation of Fuzzy time approach We explore a novel VM covert channel via I/O performance interference however it is still not perfect yet In the future we would like to make the vLeaker system robust and practical in real environments Generally the following issues must be considered  We have not evaluated our vLeaker system in a noisy environment The covert channel may lose its functionality on information exchange when other storage co-resident VMs are conducting I/O tasks Thus a solid approach must be proposed to solve this issue and make the channel reliable  Currently our covert channel is explored on local testbed which is not persuasive We expect to deploy our vLeaker system on Amazonês EC2 platform and verify whether it is practical or not As Amazonês EC2 is based on the Xen platform we are conìdent that the similar I/O timing channel can be constructed based on the local instance store

Countermeasure methodology 
 Although some approaches have been discussed to defend the VM I/O timing channel we would like to conduct more detailed research work to enhance the VM I/O isolation and mitigate such timing channel This paper presents vLeaker an information leaking system built on VM I/O performance interference by which storage co-resident VMs can exchange the information without the explicit communication manner e.g via network le sharing and such timing channel cannot be tracked by traditional rewall in information protection system To verify the practicality of our system several experiments are done on both Xen and VMware platforms And the result is quite promising the effective transmission rate is around 100 bit/s with average data error rate less than 13 on our local testbed Moreover we discuss the potential approaches in both system and user aspects to prevent or detect such kind of channel Finally exploring VM based I/O covert timing channel in third party cloud and provide effective and practical countermeasure methodologies will be our valuable future work

 10 direction, track sea ice and glacier movement with smaller and smaller resolutions, and increase the variety of measurements and their crosscutting uses.  Predicting the cost of developing and integrating into satellites new technologies such as these in advance remains one of NASA\222s biggest challenges  A decrease in available launch vehicles has become an increasing concern and a risk to implementing missions within budget.  NASA has lost the long-term availability of the highly reliable Delta II medium range launch vehicle as only five remain.  The replacement launch vehicle has suffered two failures and NASA has not been able to schedule the next launch due to the failure investigation process.  NASA needs cost effective reliable mid-size launch vehicles to efficiently launch the Earth science missions currently in development and formulation  The space industry continues to suffer from a shrinking vendor supply base.  The decrease in funding creates fewer missions, and the once numerous vendor base has consolidated.  The consolid ation creates longer lead times, costlier products and in some cases poor component reliability. When vendor delivery dates slip so do mission development and launch dates of the missions.  Mission delays also affect operations costs due to inflationary pressure, since any given operations team will cost more in later years, due to schedule slips  As missions slip, their cost increases, outpacing the budget that was established years earlier.  The life cycle of the design, manufacture, test and launch of sophisticated sensor/instrument can be 3 to 5 to sometimes 7 years, which are all budgeted years earlier and incrementally funded from year to year.  The budget includes an inflation factor, as determined by the NASA New Start Inflation Index, [8 d th e in cre m en ta l funding is based on the mission phase, scope of development and engineering to be performed, which is all based on the pre-determined inflation factor.  When a mission slips beyond the funded scheduled lifecycle new/additional inflation costs are added on top of the budgeted inflation factor.  Whether it be the sensor spacecraft, or launch vehicle, the cost of the skilled labor and material continues to increase over time.  Even though the amount of skilled labor required varies throughout the lifecycle, the right skills need to be retained in order to complete the development, e.g., the marching army needs care and feeding  From a systems perspective what this means is that the risks that a mission in development will cost more than originally budgeted are high, and as missions request more money to address additional needs, the amount available for new missions decreases.  This requires delaying new missions until funding is available and decreasing the breadth of Earth science observations that will be operational in this decade  8  H IGH S TAKES   W HAT 222 S L OST IF THE P LAN IS NOT I MPLEMENTED   By cutting or reducing funding, technology development is extended, the launch date of the missions slips -- in some cases years beyond the mission life of existing missions, thus creating data measurement/collection gaps measured in years, and possibly a decade.  With the lack of data continuity, the science community is unable to track the progress made on resource management, the reduction in rain forest area, carbon management, or issue severe weather warnings.  Figure 7 presents a schedule for the development of future missions and the overlap \(or lack thereof\ with continuing operation missions. Note that launch dates for future missions \(in green notional, not official  Numerous spacecraft of the morning and afternoon constellations are reaching their mission life and will no longer be collecting data and generating data products For example the EO-1 mission, which has the only NASA Earth observing high-spatial imaging spectrometer currently operating, has outlived its original 18-month mission life goal by 10+ years and could fail at anytime Data continuity gaps measured in years will create a loss of continuous data \(baseline\sing the scientific community to interpolate missing data segments and thus introduce risk to our scientific models used to trend longterm environmental conditions such as climate change These models help scientists answer questions about longterm climate change and global warming; has mankind in fact increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere one hundredfold within the last century or is this a natural phenomenon, part of the Earth\222s long-term climate cycle  Historically, NASA\222s Earth science missions have evolved to build upon one another.  Terra, the first Earth Observing System \(EOS\ervatory, provides global data on the state of the atmosphere, land, and oceans, as well as their interactions with solar radiation and with one another. Terra\222s sister missions, AQUA and AURA build upon Terra\222s mission and have made their own contributions to the EOS data archive, providing scientists with a continuous data set spanning over 20 years.  These data archives not only provide the science community with ever increasing accuracy and clarity in how our planet\222s ecosystems are evolving, but provide a much needed historic perspective on trends in land use, habitat loss, effects of climate change on vegetation, siltation and land use patterns on a global scale

 13 continuity  The weather and climate models used by forecasters and scientists in the United States and throughout the world rely heavily on data from NASA-developed and NOAAoperated polar-orbiting satellites.  The continuity of that data is critical.  Without these satellite observations advance notice of extreme events would be diminished Accurate three to ten day forecasts allow businesses, Federal and state governments, and the American public to prepare for severe weather events, reducing personal injury and death, safeguarding property, live stock and cutting the length of time businesses are shut down.  For example: The path of an anticipated hurricane, its accompanying storm surge, and the coastal flood potential are critical inputs to the decisions necessary to conduct safe and strategic evacuations of coastal residents.  Conversely, inaccurate forecasts can lead to needless and costly evacuations that undermine the public\222s confidence in weather warnings, and ultimately compromise evacuation response in the face of a real emergency.  Further inland, accurate rainfall forecasts are essential to mitigate against flash flooding and mudslides  Data continuity over decades, and across multiple and diverse Earth Science Missions, is providing, for the first time, the ability to look at our planet as a system and to correlate changes within these data sets with observed climate trends.  The NASA Earth Observing System's weather instruments have enabled the first improvement in weather forecasting skill in more than a decade.  Over the last twelve years, instruments on NASA\222s Terra and Aqua satellites have provided the first global measurements of aerosols in our atmosphere, which come from natural sources such as volcanoes and dust storms.  Other instruments onboard the Aura satellite study the processes that regulate the abundance of ozone in the atmosphere Data from the GRACE and ICESat missions, as well as from spaceborne radar, are used to monitor trends in thickness of the Earth\222s polar ice sheets, while the Jason-1 and Jason-2 missions are recording fluctuations in sea level Together, data integrated from all of these missions provide our scientists with a system level view of our planet\222s ecosystems and the interactions impacting weather and climate on a global scale  Both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \(NOAA\ have a mandate under the Clean Air Act to monitor ozone-depleting gases and stratospheric depletion of ozone.  A recent joint study performed by NASA and NOAA has shown that the average area covered by the Antarctic ozone hole in 2012 was the second smallest in the last 20 years, while a study in 2011 showed that the amount of ozone destroyed in the Arctic in 2011 was comparable to that seen in some years in the Antarctic where an ozone "hole" has formed each spring since the mid-1980s  NASA and NOAA have been monitoring the ozone layer via ground measurements and with a variety of instruments on satellites and balloons since the 1970s.  Long-term ozone monitoring instruments have included TOMS, SBUV/2 Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment series of instruments, the Microwave Limb Sounder, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, and the Ozone Mapper Profiler Suite \(OMPS\strument on Suomi NPP.  Arctic ozone loss has been measured with daily global observations of trace gases and clouds from NASA's Aura and CALIPSO spacecraft.  Ozone is critical to protect the Earth from harmful radiation, and continuing to develop and fund space instruments to measure ozone is necessary to predict future ozone amounts.  The Decadal Survey included a mission called the Global Atmospheric Composition Mission GACM\ continue this study of ozone  Through the use of continuous data, the United States and partnering nations share, converge on and establish the guidelines necessary to manage their resources, reduce pollutants and continue to give their people the quality of life we all currently enjoy  9  C ONCLUSIONS AND R ECOMMENDATIONS   In 2011 the NRC revisited the Decadal Survey report and published a Midterm Assessment Report.  This report stated 223NASA responded favorably and aggressively to the decadal survey, embracing its overall recommendations for Earth observations, missions, technology investments, and priorities for the underlying science.  As a consequence, the science and applications communities have made significant progress over the past 5 y T h i s paper s u mm ari zed  the foundation missions which were in place at the time of the Decadal Survey and the cooperative science realized by flying these satellites in coordinated mission orbits known as the A Train and Morning Constellations. It discussed the systematic way NASA identified the science observations necessary to address the full range of Earth Science questions, and the importance of maintaining scientific breadth.  It presented the new paradigm of developing instruments through multiple programs and decoupling that development from the eventual assembly of instruments and spacecraft to form a mission.  It stressed that for NASA to achieve the goal of developing and flying the missions defined in the Decadal Survey there must be continued funding, available, appropriately sized launch vehicles and a strong supplier base.   The consequences of not having these key elements are a gap in data continuity and a delay in answering the key Earth science questions involved in basic Earth stewardship  Within the next couple of years it is expected that there will be another Decadal Survey.  Given the budget outlook for Earth Science and NASA, there should be a recommendation to shrink the size of the instruments as much as possible while still gaining valuable observations 


 14 Then, recognizing that flying smaller payloads on traditional launch vehicles will be very wasteful, there should be a recommendation to encourage th e efforts that have been started to utilize non-traditional methods of launching instruments including hosting them on commercial satellites, combining them into larger missions that fill the launch vehicle, or sharing rides to space \226 all concepts designed to match up the size of the payload with the size of the launch vehicle.  Lastly, some consideration should be given to the on-orbit architecture of the next generation of missions \226 should they be organized into coordinated orbits such as the Afternoon Constellation and the Morning Constellation, or be put into individual orbits that maximize specific science observations, as the Tier 1 and 2 missions are doing?  Are there other constellation architectures to be explored?  Despite a steady or declining budget outlook, a future with smaller, nimble satellites sharing launch vehicles and cooperating via newly developed constellation architectures could yield a very exciting future for Earth Science  Acknowledgements 227 George Andrew, John Carey, Pete Cline, Ed Hatter, and Carey Lively provided valuable contributions in the writing of this paper  R EFERENCES   1  NASA 2010 Science Plan for NASA\222s Science Mission Directorate NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C    C o u r tes y of Dr. Ste v en P l at n i c k N A S A GS FC  3  Earth Science and Applications from Space National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond The National Academies Press, Washington D.C., 2007  4  Earth Science and Applications from Space: A Midterm Assessment of NASA's Implementation of the Decadal Survey The National Academies Press Washington D.C., 2012   C E N R  I WG EO  2005 Strategic Plan for the U.
