All non-frequent 1-itemsets is neglected to reduce the size of BitTable and improve the performance of the generation process, because all non-frequent 1-itemsets is unuseful for further generation. Then, frequent 1-itemsets are rearranged according to their lexicographic order and each item is marked with the sequence number as item ID. After frequent 2-itemsets was generated, frequent itemsets BitTable is 


constructed. Each element in BitTable represents a frequent itemset as described in 3.1. According to Apriori property candidate itemsets Ck+1 should be constructed by join two frequent itemsets of Lk that have common k-1 items. For each element E1 in frequent itemsets BitTable BLk, a middle variable MID is generated by replacing the last bit 1 of E1 with 0. Each element E2 after E1 performs a Bitwise And operation denoted & with MID. If the result equals to MID the two elements E1 and E2 in Lk have the common k-1 items Then, a candidate itemset is generated by performing Bitwise Or operation denoted | on E1 and E2 and added to candidate itemsets BitTable BCk+1. Compressing frequent itemsets into BitTable saves a lot of memory, and Bitwise And/Or operation is greatly faster than comparing each item in two frequent itemsets in Apriori Example 2. Consider D of Table. 1 and suppose MinSup=2 After the first scan of the whole database, L1 = {1 2 3 5} is generated. Item 4 is not frequent 1-itemset, so frequent 1-itemsets are rearranged and itemset {1 2 3 4} is used in the mining process instead of L1 = {1 2 3 5} to reduce the size of BitTable. When BitTableFI finished, frequent itemsets are reverted. From L1 and C1, L2 = {{1 3} {2 3} {2 4} {3 4}} can be generated. There are totally 4 items in frequent 1-itemsets so the binary code length of frequent itemsets BitTables element is 4. Frequent itemsets BitTables binary codes are 1 0 1 0}{0 1 1 0}{0 1 0 1}{0 0 1 1}}, so its corresponding BitTable BL2 is {10 6 5 3}. Itemset {1 3}MID is 8 whose binary code is {1 0 0 0} by replacing the last 1 of {1 0 1 0 with 0. Performing Bitwise And operation on {6 5 3} which represents {2 3} {2 4} {3 4} respectively, only 0 is generated so {1 3} {2 3}, {1 3} {2 4}, {1 3} {3 4} can not be jointed to generate candidate itemsets. Itemset {2 3}s MID is 4. The result of performing Bitwise And operation on 5 which represents {2 4} equals the MID, so {2 3} {2 4} can be jointed After performing Bitwise Or operation, 7 which represents {2 3 4} is generated and added to the candidate itemsets.

The whole database is compressed into a database BitTable so that it can even be stored in main memory. The database BitTables compressing proportion is about \(F1 Items/\(CPU word size All Items 32k transactions and 200 frequent 1-itemsets, for 32bit CPU the compressed database BitTables size is 1/160 of origin database. The initialization progress not only compresses the database, but also is the foundation of the quick candidate itemsets support count. The initialization progress of database BitTable acts as follows: For each item in frequent 1-itemsets the binary values of the item in database transactions are combined to an integer which is added to the database BitTable later. If the size of the database transactions is larger than the CPU word size, an integer array is used The quick candidate itemsets support count algorithm counts the support of the candidate itemsets directly on the database BitTable. For every item in each candidate itemset, the 


element of the database BitTable corresponding to the item can be directly found out, because they have the same order as the frequent 1-itemsets. Performing Bitwise And operation on 530    the corresponding elements of the items in each candidate itemset, the count of the bit 1 of the result is the support of the candidate itemset. If the support is greater than the MinSup the candidate itemset becomes a frequent itemset Example 3. In database D, L1 = {1 2 3 5}. For item 1, its corresponding database value is {1 0 1 0}, so its database BitTable value is 10 whose binary value is 1010. After the initialization of the database BitTable, the database BitTable is compressed as {10 7 14 7}. When counting support for C3 7} representing {2 3 4}, 7 & 14 & 7 equals 6 representing {0 1 1 0}, so the support of candidate itemsets {2 3 4} is 2, which means {2 3 5} is a frequent itemset, as shown in Fig. 2  item 2 0 1 1 1 7   item 3 1 1 1 0 14   item 5 0 1 1 1 7

Different rules have different consequences, many of which are conflict. The problem is how to decide which class label should be assigned to the test data. We can simply label the test data case using the highest confidence rule that has the highest firing strength, as confidence can be viewed as a probability estimate indicating the likelihood that the test data belong to rule and the firing strength is the degree of the data matching to the rule. Given a test data I, consider the two rules in Table 1 


Rule C and D have the highest firing strength and Rule D has higher confidence than Rule C, so we classify I to y4 with rule D. However, though rule A and B have lower firing strength, their confidence and support are much higher than those of rule D. It seems more reasonable to classify I to y1 or y2 with rule A or B. To score each fuzzy classification rules more reasonably, we introduce a new parameter to score the weight of a fuzzy classification rules R to the test data I 2  According to the new parameter, Rule B has the highest score, ?<I, B>=0.3136. So the test data I is labeled with y2 We classify the test data with all the fuzzy classification rules in BitTableAC. So after scoring each fuzzy classification rules with parameter ?, we calculate the weight of each class to the test data  where  and i I r r y ir R cons r yN      1 where R is the set of all fuzzy classification rules, cons\(r the consequence of the rule r, and N is the number of r in R which satisfies cons\(r with the max value of iy  Finally, the pseudo-code of BitTableAC is shown as follows Input: training data set Tr test data set Te support threshold MinSup confidence threshold MinConf the num of fuzzy partitions \(NFP Output: class label set of test data C

EXPERIMENT RESULT We have implemented BitTableAC in Matlab 7.1. The experiments are performed on a 2.4GHz Pentium4 PC with 768MB memory, running Windows 2000. Datasets used in experiments come from UCI Machine Learning Repository, a commonly used benchmarking database. Their basic information is listed in Table 3. We compare BitTableAC with some other classification algorithms on classification accuracy. The second part focuses on discussing the effect of the varying parameters on the classification accuracy of BitTableAC. All the experiments are repeated ten times, and the results are the average. We mainly study the classification accuracy and do not take the classification efficiency into consider, so we just modify the Apriori algorithm to mine association rules for its simplicity. In other words, the efficiency of the BitTableAC can easily be improved by adapting other efficient mining algorithms  531    Table 3 Datasets used in experiments Dataset Size Attributes Classes 1 Glass 214 9 7 2 Iris 150 4 3 3 Breast 699 10 2

We also include the C4.5 and LIBSVM results on the same datasets as a reference. C4.5 is a well-known traditional classifier based on decision tree induction technique, and LIBSVM is an accurate support vector machine classifier For the fair of the comparison, we do not implement these algorithms, but their classification accuracies are obtained from their research literatures.

CONCLUSION In this paper, an accurate associative classifier BitTableAC is proposed. It employs BitTable to mine association rules 


efficiently, and fuzzy c-means \(FCM attributes. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare BitTableAC with other well-known classifiers on accuracy including previous associative classifiers, C4.5 and LIBSVM on 6 test datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The best estimation accuracy was obtained in building stage, which also corroborates our findings that best estimation accuracy was in building stage. The negative values in Bias criterion show underestimation. It is acknowledged that MMRE is unbalanced in many validation circumstances and leads to overestimation more than underestimation. In our case, we found that MMRE leads to underestimation in most stages. This is may be related to the absence of systematic scheme between all prior effort records   253   Figure 1.

MMREs of our approach have been reduced by at least 35.05 and at most 93%. Biases have been reduced by at least 3.5% and at most 159%.We have to bear in mind that the length of interval plays important role in estimation accuracy, thus, when the universe of discourse is partitioned into several equal intervals, the distribution of data should be taken into account. Moreover, we should remove the extreme values because they affect interval partitioning, thus, estimation accuracy Figures 7 to 11 show comparison between proposed approach and exponential regression in each stage by using Boxplot. The Boxplot [17] offers a way to compare between estimation models based on their absolute residuals. The Boxplot is non-parametric statistics used to show the median as central tendency of distribution, interquartile range and the outliers of individual models [17]. The length of Boxplot from 


lower tail to upper tail shows the spread of the distribution. The length of box represents the interquartile range that contains 50% of observations The position of median inside the box and length of Boxplot indicate the skewness of distribution. A Boxplot with a small box and long tails represents a very peaked distribution while a Boxplot with long box represents a flatter distribution. The prominent and common characteristic among these figures is the spread of absolute residuals for our approach is less than spread of exponential regression which presents more accurate results. The larger interquartile of exponential regression indicates a high dispersion of the absolute residuals. The Boxplot revealed that the box length for our models is smaller than exponential regression which also indicates reduced variability of absolute residuals. The median of our model is smaller than median of exponential regression which revealed that at least half of the predictions of our model are more accurate than exponential regression 254  Figure 7. Boxplot of absolute residuals for the specification stage  Figure 8. Boxplot of absolute residuals for the design stage   Figure 9. Boxplot of absolute residuals for the building stage Figure 10. Boxplot of absolute residuals for the testing stage   The lower tails of our model is much smaller than upper tail which means the absolute residuals are skewed towards the smaller value Figure 11 illustrates the reason of why prediction of implementation stage in our approach produced the worst accuracy. The reason related to the existing of outlier. Although one project is considered as an outlier the MMRE is easily influenced with that project Based on the obtained results, we can observe that 


exponential regression gave bad accuracy. The reason may relate to the structure complexity of prior effort records. There is no correlation between all prior stages and target stage To ensure that the results obtained are not by chance we investigated the statistical significance of the proposed approach using Wilcoxon sum rank test for absolute residuals as shown in Table IV. In this test if the resulting p-value is small \(p<0.05 statistically significant difference can be accepted between the two samples median. The residuals obtained using the proposed approach were significantly different from those obtained by exponential regression Suggesting that, there is difference if the predications generated using the proposed approach or exponential regression and based on the accuracy comparison in Tables II and III we can safely conclude that our proposed method outperformed exponential regression for stage effort estimation Figure 11. Boxplot of absolute residuals for the implementation stage  VIII. CONCLUSIONS Some of software projects are failed due to the absence of re-estimation during software development which results in huge gap between initial plan and final outcome. Even with good estimate at first stage the project manager must keep update with project progress and should be able to re-estimate the project at any particular point of project in order to re-allocate the proper number of resources. The objective of this paper was to check whether the prior effort records can 255 be used to predict stage effort with reasonable accuracy or not. The obtained results revealed that using association rule and Fuzzy set theory lead to significant improvement in stage-effort estimation and give project manager an evolving picture about project progress. Comparing our approach with exponential regression showed that there is a considerable potential in estimation accuracy. As part of future plan, we 


intend to expand this work to involve some interesting features in each stage prediction and evaluate it on many datasets   REFERENCES  1] F. Ricardo, N. Ana, M. Paula, B. Gleidson, R.

encountering a related term, i.e. IC\(c e intuition behind the use of the negative likelihood is that the more probable a term to appear, the less information it conveys. All these features show that Jiangs measure tends to be more general and more appropriate for evaluating nontaxonomically related terms. Indeed, a high score of the relatedness measures suggests a strong relationship between terms Nevertheless, all relatedness measures have limitations because they assume that all the semantic content of a particular term is modeled by semantic links in WordNet Consequently, in many situations, truly related terms obtain a low scores even though their belongings to a certain category of tags, e.g., jargon tags Additionally, when measuring the quality of an automatically knowledge acquisition results, the typical measures used in Information Retrieval are Recall, Precision and F-Measure. However, computing Recall and F-Measure requires the availability of a Gold Standard. Hence, we will only compute the Precision which speci?es to which extent the non-taxonomic relationships is extracted correctly. In this case, the ratio between the correctly extracted relations i.e., their relatedness measures is greater than or equal to a minimum threshold, and the whole number of extracted ones is computed. Thus, we have Precision Total correctly selected entities Total selected entities 12 http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-Similarity 13 A term refers to a tag subject or a tag object C. Evaluation of non-taxonomic relationships Only a percentage of the full set of non-taxonomic relationships \(89 is caused by the presence of non standard terms which are not contained in WordNet and, in consequence, cannot be evaluated using WordNet-based relatedness measures. Fig. 5 depicts the evaluation results of the extracted non-taxonomic relationships against their relatedness measures High relatedness score \(88 17% of the extracted relationships, as most of terms are strongly related with respect WordNet Null Scores were obtained for 5% of the extracted 


relationships. Analyzing this case in more detail, we have observed that the poor score is caused in many situations by the way in which Jiangs distance metric works. This latter completely depends on the distance between two terms based on the number of edges found on the path between them in WordNet. In consequence this measure returns a value that does not fully represent reality. For example, on the one hand, Jiangs distance metric returns a null value for the relationship between insurance and car, even though the ?rst is a commonly related to the second, i.e., car involved insurance Finally with a minimal Jiangs distance metric threshold, set to 46%, the computed precision of correctly extracted relationships candidates is equal to 68.8 An example of extracted non-taxonomic relationships is depicted in Table V where each relation describes the subject tag, e.g., tool, the predicate, e.g is being developed within, and the object tag, e.g mesh. Fig. 4 represent a fragment output of the extracted ontological structure where each concept de?nes a set of similar and synonym tags and labels, i.e., mentions has been, revealed, caused and is created with describe the predicates of the non-taxonomic relationships between terms Due to the limitations observed by the automatic evaluation procedure and the lack of gold standards containing non-taxonomic relationships, we have examined the extracted non-taxonomic relationships from a linguistic point 377 Top space      distance     quad great     groovy nifty caused address      addresses extension      quotation   reference  references extensions        referenz     source      refrence sources    rfrences    quotations research    search     searching searchs open-source     open_source

This qualitative evaluation can bring some interesting insights about the kind of results one can expect Invalid relations are extracted: Even though a relation such as music cities skill is considered as correct one since tag subject, tag object and predicate are correctly extracted. From a semantic point of view, this relation has no meaning. Hence, a higher precision is expected Figure 5. Summary of non-taxonomic evaluation measure Table V EXAMPLES OF EXTRACTED NON TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS Subject Predicate Object search has been reference reference mentions search tool is being developed within mesh security added encoding search revealed reference java provides library by performing the sense analysis on complete relations An ambiguity in the extracted predicates between terms is observed: Hence, same relations are redundant since they use a synonym predicates between terms, e.g java provides library and java yields library. Thus we expect that the redundancy removal within extracted relations will be of bene?t for the improvement of the 


obtained results VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK The extraction of non-taxonomic relationships from folksonomies is to the best of our knowledge is the least tackled task within ontology building from folksonomy. This is why there is a need of novel and general purpose approaches covering the full process of learning relationships. In this paper, we introduced a new approach called NONTAXFOLKS that starts by pre-processing tags aiming at getting a set of frequent tagsets corresponding to an agreed representation Then, they are used to retrieve related tags using external resources such as WordNet. Thanks to the particular structure of triadic concepts, it allows grouping semantically related tags by considering the semantic relatedness embodied in the different frequencies of co-occurences among users, resources and tags in the folksonomy. Thereafter we introduced an algorithm called NTREXTRACTION for extracting non-taxonomic relationships between pair of tags picked from the triadic concepts. In summary, our approach uses several well known techniques \(such as formal concept analysis or association rule discovering the social bookmaring environnement in order to propose a new way of extracting labeled non-taxonomic relationships between tags. Currently, we are investigating the following topic concerning the discovered predicates between two terms. Indeed, in order to avoid relationships redundancy and thus a redundancy in the builded ontology. One can try to classify them into prede?ned semantic classes, detect synonyms, inverses, etc. A standard classi?cation of verbs could be used for this purpose, adding additional information about the semantic content, e.g., senses, verb types, thematic roles, etc., of predicates relationships 378 REFERENCES 1] J.
