Two approaches are proposed over the ServiceMap association rule mining and relation-aware crossworkflow searching Both approaches were validated using the real-life data obtained from the myExperi ment repository  I. INTRODUCTION  In many disciplines including biomedicine and bioinformatics Web services have been widely used as virtualized access points to various data and computational resources 1   T o  a c c e l e r a t e  d a t a i n t ensive scientific exploration services are orchestrated i nto scientific workflows that precisely describe a comp osition of tasks and the dataflow among them [2   O v e r  t h e  past three years we participated in the development of C ancer Biomedical Informatics Grid caBIG 3   a  p l a t f o r m  for cancer researchers to share service-based capabilit ies. We have extended the Taverna Workbench 4  i n t o  t h e  caGrid Workflow Toolkit  5   a  s o f t w a r e  s u i t e  f o r  bioinformaticians to compose and coordinate caBIG services as well as third-party Web services Given the caGrid Workflow Toolkit and other tools i n the biomedical workflow domain however bioinformaticians are still hesitated to exploit th e existing services. One major reason is that they are unaware of the usage patterns of available services 6   t h u s  c a n n ot effectively incorporate the best practices when the y build new workflows. This paper presents a follow-up work of our network analysis on the myExperiment [7   a n  o n line biological workflow repository Our idea is inspired by the Global Positioning Syst em GPS that is capable of recommending travel paths between locations An idea of ServiceMap is introdu ced where services are modeled as locations in a map an d their past usage connections \(in common workflows are modeled as transportation paths between them. Based on the ServiceMap, we aim to provide a GPS-like suppor t to 1\ help domain scientists better understand various usage patterns of the existing services; and 2\ provide a systemlevel support to recommend possible service compositions The former objective shall help domai n scientists gain confidence of using available servi ces; and the latter will pave a new pathway toward automatic  service composition Note that although our project  focuses on studying biomedical services and workflo ws our approaches can be applied to other domains The remainder of the paper is organized as follows  Section II discusses the motivation of our research  Section III describes the overall ServiceMap approa ch Section IV presents an association mining-based met hod for suggesting relevant services Section V present s a relation-aware cross-workflow searching method for  suggesting operation chains Section VI presents an  empirical study Section VII discusses related work  and Section VIII draws conclusions  II. RESEARCH MOTIVATION Our experience in caBIG and other service-based bioinformatics grids shows that although the shari ng of service-based capabilities opens a gateway to resou rce reuse, the mission is still far from accomplished We have conducted a study 6  o v e r  t h e  w o r k f l o w s  s t o r e d  i n  the myExperiment a public scientific workflow reposito ry Applying social network analysis techniques we examined the interaction patterns between the workf lows and comprising services This state-of-the-art anal ysis revealed that biomedical services are currently use d in an ad hoc  style and with low reusability This suggests a need for techniques that help domain scientists bet ter locate interested services and workflow fragments a nd reuse them to attain their research purposes Our experience in caBIG also summarizes two

questions that domain scientists frequently ask whe n they try to exploit external Web services in building a scientific workflow Q1  Given the services I plan to use what are the other services often used together with them by ot her scientists Q2  Given two or more services I want to use together can I find an operation chain which is already use d by others, to connect them  Q1 is usually raised when a scientist first reaches some data or analytical capabilities wrapped and exposed  as services Because he is new to the services the sc ientist intends to know how his peer scientists use them to gether with other services of which he may or may not be a ware Besides due to the explorative nature of scientifi c workflows incorporating a newly found service with  known ones may lead to new research ideas. For exam ple assume that a scientist plans to leverage a statist ical analysis service over microarray data to find signi ficantly expressed genes in some tissue However he is unaw are of a gene pathway service that is able to expose interactions among genes. If he can be prompted tha t his peer scientists frequently use the pathway service together with the statistical one, he knows that from the mi croarray data he has at hand he can identify not only signi ficant genes but also their interaction patterns Q2 is usually asked when a scientist’s experiment procedure becomes complex and requires to use multi ple external services In the aforementioned microarray  experiment a scientist intends to exploit three se rvices one for generating microarray data one for analyzi ng microarray data and one for retrieving pathway information However linking the three services is  not trivial e.g microarray data have to be cleaned b efore being input to the statistical service; access to t he pathway service requires a special security mechanism; and so on The scientist thus wishes to know the exact sequenc e in which these services can be chained together In real-life transportation systems two questions Q1 and Q2 are frequently asked against a map or a GPS  system Q1  Do people who visit some places also visit others Q2 Can I find a route between two places Q1 and Q2 become counterparts of the questions Q1  and Q2, respectively, if we make the following anal ogies 1\ service operations vs. places in a map, and 2\ s cientific workflows \(or service compositions\ vs. streets/rou tes in a map Consequently the questions asked by scientist s resemble those that can be solved by a map or a GPS  system \(i.e., to recommend places to visit or find a route two places\. This analogy inspires us to take a ste p further from our previous network analysis of the myExperim ent by building a service network and associated facili ty to address Q1 and Q2 just like how a map/GPS system addresses Q1' and Q2  III. SERVICEMAP APPROACH As depicted in the previous example Q1 and Q2 are not isolated instead they may be raised in differ ent stages of an in-silico  experiment Q1 is usually raised when an experiment is in its conceptual design leve l and scientists need to figure out the available resourc es to leverage. Q2 is raised in a later stage when the ro utine of an experiment needs to be concretized in the operat ional level It is also a common practice to iterate over  these two stages due to the explorative nature of bioinfo rmatics experiments Inspired by this requirement from mult iple user communities including caBIG we propose ServiceMap as a framework to address both Q1 and Q2  in a holistic manner Figure 1 illustrates the gene ral approach of ServiceMap We first download all the myExperiment workflows We abstract these workflows  by removing non-Web \(i.e., WSDL-based\ services, su ch as local beanshells xml manipulating blocks while  maintaining the data flows between services Afterw ards these abstract workflows are combined into ServiceM ap ServiceMap consists of two disjoint networks \(graph s\: an undirected workflow-service network  and a directed operation network   Figure 1.

In the undirected workflow-service network, nodes a re either workflows or services and edges represent th e inclusive relations between them -- that is, a work flow is connected to a service if it consists of it In the  directed operation network, nodes are operations in services and a directed edge represents a data link between two operations in some workflow. More details regarding  the myExperiment workflow set, how networks are built a nd analyzed can be explored in [6    While 6  f o c u s e s  o n  h o w  t o  b u i l d  a n d  c a l c u l a t e  t h e  metrics of these networks this paper focuses on algorithms on these networks to answer Q1 and Q2 A  brief summary of these algorithms is as follows To  answer Q1 we derive the frequent item sets and associations rules in the workflow-service network  and recommend relevant services in a given context i.e  existing services in a workflow To answer Q2 we proposed a relation-aware, cross-workflow search me thod to identify an operation chain which connects two services and is composed by fragments from individu al workflows  IV. Q1: PEOPLE WHO USE THESE SERVICES ALSO USE  This section presents the ServiceMap approach to address Q1 people who use these services also use what others  We adopt the well-known association rule mining method to formulate and solve this problem. Due to space limitation we only highlight the skeleton of our ap proach More details regarding association rule mining can be found in [8   I n  t h i s  s e c t i o n  w e  u s e d  a n  o p e n s o u r c e data mining tool Weka 9  t o  c a l c u l a t e  f r e q u e n t  i t e m  s e t s and association rules Step 1: treat services as items  1 2     m S s s s  is the set of services in all myExperiment workflows W to be defined later Step 2: treat workflows as transactions   1 2     n W w w w  is the set of workflows in myExperiment. Each workflow consists of a subset of  services from S  Step 3: calculate frequent item sets Since the number of transactions n 347\ are relatively small compared to the number of items  m 241 we do not get any large frequent set. The maximum support for any item set X S  and 2 X  is only 5.5 i.e 19 items Step 4: calculate association rules

Services frequently used together and the  association rules  V. Q2: FIND A PATH CHAINING TWO SERVICES/OPERATIONS  This section presents the ServiceMap approach to address Q2 given the two or more services I want to use together, give me a path between them  Current scientific artifact repositories such as BioCatalogue 1  a n d  m y E x p e r i m e n t   t y p i c a l l y  a d o p t  keyword-based search. The idea is to index an entit y as a vector of keywords and use the TF-IDF \(term frequen cyinverse document frequency algorithm 10  t o  m e a s u re the weight of each keyword. Methods have recently b een developed to search substructures in a tree- or gra ph-like structure 11  o r  o v e r  n e s t e d  w o r k f l o w s   1 2    T h e s e  approaches suffer from two limitations First each  result comes from a single document For example two workflows cannot be concatenated as a result even by doing that you can chain two services. Second, sequ ential relationships cannot be established between keyword s For example one can search for a workflow containi ng

both services foo  and bar  but cannot define the order of their appearance To answer Q2, we derived a directed relation betwee n service operations We denote this operation network  as  S shown in Figure 3 by examining the invocation relations among service operations Nodes represent  operations in services and a directed edge represe nts a data link between two operations in an abstract wor kflow shown in Figure 1  S can be seen as a directed map in which service operations are places and workflows are routes connecting them Remark   S was firstly introduced in Figure 5 of our previous network study reported in [6   H e r e  w e  i l l ustrate a similar graph \(Figure 3\ for two reasons. First as more experimental workflows are reported to myExperiment  and the registered processes keep evolving, the ope ration network  S will keep changing. Second, we improved our workflow parsing algorithm and identified more serv ice operations and connections that were hidden in othe r blocks e.g sub-workflow and not previously foun d in 6  A. Construction of the directed operation network  The directed operation network 001\002 shown in Figure 3 can be generated using the algorithm shown below T he input is the entire set of workflows stored in the myExperiment repository 001\002 is created incrementally each workflow may contribute more nodes and edges i nto the graph  Algorithm 1 Create operation network Input A repository of workflows 003\004\005  Output a directed operation network 001\002  1 001\002 006\007 010\011 012 013\014 015 initiate the entire network 2 for each  016\017 020 003\004\005  3 021\022\023\024 006\007 021\022\023\010\011 021\022\023\012 013\014 015\025 001 014 015  4.     find all data links in workflow wf  5 for  each data link 020 016\017  6 026\026\026\026\027 014 030\021\027\031\021\032\033\034\026\021\027\030\035\025 026\026\036 014 037\033 \032\033\034\026\021\027\030\035  7 if  027"\036  021\022\023\010  then add 027"\036  021\022\023\010  endif  8.         add edge 027\011 036  021\022\023\012  9 end for  10 for each  027 020 021\022\023\010  11 if a is a service then add 027  001  endif  12 end for  13 for each  027 020 001  14 if  027\011    021\022\023\012  then continue endif  15 for each 036 020 001\011 036  027  16.            len = shortest_path \(a,b,tmpE 17 if len   then  18 if  027"\036  010  then 19 then add edge  027\011 036  011 037\033\011 016\017  012  20 else update edge with  027\011 036  011 037\033\011 016\017  21 endif  22 endif  23 end for  24 end for  25 end for   Line 4 finds all data links in a workflow, each dir ectly connecting two tasks that are building components t hat may or may not be external service operations.

steps between them within one specific workflow T he rationale is that a domain scientist may select a specific path because the corresponding workflow is created by her collaborator In general, any shortest path algorithm can be appl ied in Line 15 to find paths between a pair of service operations such as the well-known Dijkstra algorit hm Since our experiment exposed the sparseness feature will discuss in Section 5 we applied an enhanced versi on of the Dijkstra algorithm for a higher performance by  storing the graph in the form of adjacency lists an d using a Fibonacci heap as a priority queue  B Motivation for relation-aware and cross-workflow  search We propose to use network  S and explore a relationaware and cross-workflow search technique Before diving into details let’s take an example to expla in how  S supports such a search A typical question in bioinformatics is that, “Given a DNA sequence, can I first find similar ones from WU-BLAST  and then compare them with those from ClustalW2   WU-BLAST  and ClustalW2 are two popular sequence alignment services To answer this question we can leverage relation-a ware search to find candidate workflows that start from some operation in WU-BLAST  and end with some operation in ClustalW2  The question can be thus rewritten into the following query search workflow where WU-BLAST 001 ClustalW2   Figure 4. Obtain a service chain between two operat ions  It is quite likely that in the repository there is  not a single workflow which contains an operation chain starting from WU-BLAST  and ends at ClustalW2  In this case the result should be a new workflow concatenat ing snippets from several existing ones We use the lar gest cluster in  S to demonstrate this idea. This cluster, which is in the top-left of Figure 3, is shown in Figure 4 with the name of each node \(i.e., operation\ in it. Operatio ns 116 117, 168 and 169 belong to service WU-BLAST 128 and 130 belong to service ClustalW2  Two paths 169,116,117,119,128,130 and 168,116,117,119,128  130 are two candidate paths satisfying the search criterion Based on scientist-side context e.g w ith the DNA sequence at hand\, the first candidate workflow will be suggested the data format matches operation 169 s input. The resulting routine actually is a concaten ation of three snippets each of which from a myExperiment workflow  001\001\002\003\004\005\004\006\007\010\011\012\013\014\015\012\016\010\017\020\021\022\004\006\007\010\011\012\013\003 001\001\023\003\004\005\004\006\007\010\011\012\013\014\015\012\016\010\017\024\025\013\026\016\012\003 001\001\027\003\004\005\030\031\032\025\013\033\034\014\015\012\016\010\017\032\025\013\033\034\007\011\013\033\034\003 001\035\036\003\004\005\037\010\021\012\013\011\010\004\035\014\015\012\016\010\017\020\021\022\037\010\021\012\013\011\010\004\035\003 001 !\003\004\005\037\010\021\012\013\011\010\004\035\014\015\012\016\010\017\033\034\025\033"\005\013\011\013\021\012\003 001\002\036\003\004\005\004\006\007\010\011\012\013\014\015\012\016\010\017\024\025\013#\020$\024\020\011%\012\003 001\002\027\003\004\005\004\006\007\010\011\012\013\014\015\012\016\010\017\024\025\013\030\011\013\011\031\011\012\025\012\003  This example demonstrates that  S allows us to discover global relations spread in multiple workfl ows and originally not easy to identify Our experience  working with caBIG community shows that this featur e is quite useful for scientists to explore best practic es from multiple colleagues and combine their experiment snippets into a more comprehensive one  C. Method for relation-aware and cross-workflow sea rch This sub-section describes the method for relationaware and cross-workflow search For simplicity Q2 is formulated as follows given two operations i o  j o  a set of workflows W and the derived operation network  S  how to find a path in  S that connects i o  j o and meets a certain criterion, e.g., this path should cross lea st number of workflows The across-least-workflow criterion is reasonable because each time when two snippets from two workflows are to be concatenated, additional tuning such as data transformation and security enforcement are  needed Therefore a path which crosses less number of workflows is more desirable Again if we make this analogy that operations are stops in a public trans portation system and a workflow is a bus/subway route connect ing multiple stops, we prefer a path between two stops which crosses less number of routes i.e with less tran sfer overhead  Figure 5. Obtain least transfer route between two operations  Figure 5 is a summary of the approach proposed in t his section.

finding a path between two operations, from matrix T we know how many transfers is needed by referring bac k from matrix T to R and A we obtain these paths  Step 1: calculate adjacent matrix 1 2     n W W W W  is the set of workflows we extracted from myExperiment    i i i W O E  in which i O is the set of service operations in i W and i E is the set of edges between these operations  0,1 i i i A O O   is the adjacent matrix of i W That is, given  ik ij i o o O  element   k j of i A is defined as 1 if has alink to in 0 otherwise ik ij i ikj o o W A 010 011  012 011 013  i A can be directly obtained from i W  Based on adjacent matrix we can derive the reachability matr ix of each workflow  Step 2: calculate reachability matrix  0,1 i i i R O O   is the reachability matrix of i W  Given  ik ij i o o O  element   k j of i R is defined as 1 if can reach in    0 otherwise ik ij i ikj i ik ij o o W R R o o 010 011 012 011 013 001 001      0 i i o O R o o   001  i R cannot be directly obtained from i W  instead it can be calculated from matrix  i A   1  2  i m i i i i A A A A    001  i m is the cardinality of i A   1 if 0 0 otherwise ikj ikj A R 010  011  012 011 013  i R represents the reachability relations between any two operations in i W  and by aggregating them we can examine the reachability relations among operations  in a global, cross-workflow perspective,  i.e., in  S  Given the workflow set 1 2     n W W W W  and the operation set 1 2     m O o o o   we now combine 1 2     n R R R into an aggregated relation  ij m m R r      1 ij kij k r R  014 001  i.e ij r equals the number of workflows in which i o can reach j o and 0 ii r 001  We then calculate the th n power of R  n n ij m m R r  002 003  006 007 and 1 1 n n n ij ik kj k r r r  014 001  Therefore n ij r equals the number of times i o can reach j o by traversing n workflows i.e transferring 1 n times Now we know for each given operation pair t he existence of a directed chain which is across a cer tain amount of workflows and connects these two operatio ns  Step 3: calculate transfer matrix At the beginning of this section we emphasize that we want a service chain across least workflows  like passengers want an itinerary across least routes \(i e., with least transfers In order to achieve that goal we need to introduce another transfer matrix T  Given m operations and n workflows    m i n  1   s  t  0  k ij m m ij ij T t t k n r     001  T reveals the least-transfer distances between two operations By definition 1 ij t is the number of least transfers through which i o can reach j o  If 0 ij t  then there is not a path between them across the availab le workflows  Step 4: calculate transfer paths For 2 ij t k    at least one transfer is needed for any path from i o to j o  i.e we can find a least-transfer path 1 1 k i q q j o o o o     004 such that 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 k k k iq q q q q q j t t t t     004  Such a path \(or paths\ can be found using the recur sive algorithm shown in Figure 6   Figure 6. Obtain least transfer paths between two operations  Line 1 given T and  i j o o    find a service chain between i o and j o with least transfer Line 2: initiate the result path set to null Line 4-6 0 ij t  means i cannot reach j by any transfer Line 9-11 1 ij t  means i  can reach j  without transfer find the workflow in which i  can reach j  and get the

service chain in it Line 13-21 2 ij t  means i can reach j with at least one transfer find an immediate node k  that i  can reach and connect it with a least-transfer path from k to j  Line 24: return the result path list  VI. AN EMPIRICAL STUDY Given the matrix-based approach described in 5.3, w e calculated the least-transfer distances and transfe r paths between any pair of service operations invoked in t he workflow set which are registered in the myExperim ent repository. The dataset was taken from myExperiment on Aug-23-2010 and it contains 347 workflows, 241 serv ices and 283 operations. Figure 7 is the histogram showi ng the least-transfer distances between any pair of nodes representing the 283 operations in  S i.e 283*283  80,089 node pairs\. 375 pairs of operations can rea ch each other without any transfer, i.e., they are connecte d within a single workflow. 147 operation pairs are reachabl e via 1 transfer and 61 and 14 pairs are reachable via 2 a nd 3 transfers respectively Only 2 pairs of operations  are reachable via 4 transfers; and there is no path wit h more than 4 transfers between any operations In contrast to a public transportation system the reachability among the operations is obviously spar se only 375+147+61+14+2=599 out of 80,089 operation pairs are reachable about 0.75 if two nodes are  not reachable within 4 transfers, they are not reachabl e at all The sparseness is due to two major reasons First bioinformatics services/operations cannot be arbitr arily connected, because they have different usage scenar ios by nature Second the services in the myExperiment workflows largely function individually rather than  collaboratively 6   A l t h o u g h  t h e  m y E x p e r i m e n t  workflow set only illustrates a subset of the usage of the bioinformatics services our experiment does reveal  the necessity of increasing the reusability and collabo ration among bioinformatics services  Figure 7. Least-transfer-distance histogram of myExperiment workflows  VII. RELATED WORK  Our presented work is closely related to three categories of research automatic service composition artifact recommendation in software engineering and scientific workflow and network analysis in software engineering and workflow  A. Automatic service composition Various automatic service composition techniques have been developed to discover relevant services and compose them in a proper sequence as discussed in the survey 13   T h es e m e t h o d s  c an  y i e l d  g o o d  r es u l t s  w h e n  candidate services provide comprehensive metadata \(such as input/output, pre/post conditions, and QoS\ and/or the composition problem can be translated into a good formalism like optimization AI-based planning and process algebra In bioinformatics however many services are widely used without metadata and formal models Meanwhile online workflow repositories such as myExperiment allow scientists to share successful experimental routines that contain best practices to compose services Based on this observation we have adopted a network-based approach to analyze the usage patterns of the biomedical services and provide recommendations based on empirical workflows  B. Artifact Recommendation Artifact discovery and reuse has been investigated in software engineering 14 15   w i t h  a n  e m p h a s i s  o n  mining patterns from software repositories and recommending software artifacts. In the area of scientific workflow there are already many systems including Kepler 16   T av er n a  4    P e g as u s   1 7    an d  S w i f t   1 8    The popular business workflow language BPEL has also been adopted 19   M o r e  r e cen t l y   p at t er n s  f r o m  p as t  usage data are summarized to predict the most likely nextstep in building visualization pipelines [20   an d  cas e b as e reasoning is also used to find a similar workflow and use it to suggest the next component to use 21   O u r  ServiceMap differentiates from those approaches by providing suggestions which are relation-aware and across multiple workflows  C. Network analysis Researchers have recently started to build social networks to support scientific application sharing myExperiment and BioCatalogue are two examples maintaining social networks for life science workflows and services respectively In software engineering Codebook 22  b u i l d s  a d i r ect ed  g r ap h  co n n ect i n g  programmers to reusable work artifacts from software repositories. Within the directed graph, a regular language reachability algorithm is used to discover any transitive connections In ServiceMap we have adopted a matrix-based approach similar to [23  t h at  c al cu l at e s  t r an s f er  r o u t es  i n  a  public transportation system ServiceMap is inspired by the analogy between service-based workflows and transportation network, but our approach addresses many challenges unique to service composition and validated by empirical data from myExperiment 001 002\001 003\001\001 003\002\001 004\001\001 004\002\001 005\001\001 005\002\001 006\001\001 001 003 004 005 006 007\010\011\012 012\007\020\021\002\005\004\011\017\004\012\011\022\002 023 024\015\013\005\006 003\005\015\012\006\017\002\005\023\022\013\006\003\015\012\016\002\006\004\021\002\003\025\002\002\012\004\012\011\022\002\006 003\005\015\012\006\017\002\005\004\022\013\006\003\015\012\016\002\004\021\002\003\025\002\012\004\003\025\011\004\011\024\002\005\015\003\013\011\012\006\004\013\012\004\026\027

In business process management BPM field a framework named TomTom4BPM 24 25  ad o p t s  process mining technique for various purposes such as comparing the actual process execution with pre-modeled ones and dynamically navigating during process exceptions In contrast our work focuses more on suggesting new service/workflows based on existing ones during construction time  while TomTom4BPM concentrates on mining process logs to better navigate execution during run-time   VIII.

 i j  if\(P _ rule<n _rule  i  4 In the algorithm of classification, the function Sort\(P _ AR returns PL and the itemsets in PL are sorted by descending support values, the function GetElem\(pL, i rule in the set of PL. Also, we can deduce the returns of the function of Sort{N_AR IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm in this section, we report our experimental results on comparing the algorithm against the popular classification method: CBA All the experiments are performed on a 2.2GHz Core PC with 1 G main memory, running Microsoft Windows Server 2003. CBA was implemented by its authors, respectively We choose a training dataset including 1000 objects which have 12 attributes and 7 class labels In our experiments, min_confis set to 50%. For min_sup it is more complex. min_sup has a strong effect on the quality of the classifier produced. If min _sup is set too high those possible rules that cannot satisfy min_sup but with high confidences will not be included, and also the rules may fail to cover all the training cases. In the experiments reported before, we set min_sup to 6 The results are shown in Table I TABLE!. EXPERIMENT RESULTS  CBA Algorithm in this paper Rule Positve 213 120 Class Association Rule Negative Class Association 0 63 Rule Total 213 183 


Recall Ratio 92.3% 95.1 Precision Ratio 90.2% 92.9 539 As can be seen from the table, the algorithm outperforms CBA on recall ratio and precision ratio. It is clear from these objects that our algorithm produces more accurate classifiers Our Recall Ratio and Precision Ratio is higher than CBA So, it shows that the algorithm outperforms CBA in terms of average accuracy and efficiency There are two important parameters, database coverage threshold and confidence difference threshold. As discussed before, these two thresholds control the number of rules selected for classification In general, if the set of rules is too small, some effective rules may be missed. On the other hand, if the rule set is too large, the training data set may be over fit. Thus, we need to test the sensitivities of the two thresholds for classification accuracy According to our experimental results, there seems no way to pre-determine the best threshold values. Fortunately both curves are quite plain. That means the accuracy is not very sensitive to the two thresholds values V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we examined a number of problems that exist in current classification techniques. A new algorithm is presented to generate all positive and negative class association rules and to build an accurate classifier. The method has several distinguished features: \(1 classification is performed based on positive and negative class association rules, which leads to better overall classification accuracy; \(2 and negative class association rules effectively based on correlation between itemsets. Our experiment shows that the algorithm is highly effective at classification and has better average classification accuracy and efficiency in comparison with CBA. In our future work, we will focus on building more accurate classifiers by using more sophisticated techniques and mining more useful positive and negative class association rules REFERENCES I] Wenmin Li, Jiawei Han and Jian Pei, "CMAR: Accurate and Efficient Classification Based on Multiple Class-Association Rules

that selecting useful clustering characters based on the rules of the observable world. However, this method has a problem of scarcity of information and lack of testifY. This paper aims to establish an association analysis model based on case study and then discover new knowledge from limited information. This paper is supposed to contribute to the name distinction and some other clustering analysis with more reliable method and theory We obtain the association rules by the experiment as followed: having same coauthor; having same workplace and years; having same publication and years The association rules selected by the experiment could be easily explained and commonsensible. Considering the association rules coming from the objective data and data mining method, they are more reliable Our future research will focus on the negative correlation between information [12] that is the local minimum points of function y=f\(x method into the feature extraction of pattern recognitions which have relative sub-information ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported partly by the Special Fund for Fast Sharing of Science Paper in Net Era by CSTD under Grant No. 20096102410001 REFERENCES I] X.Yin, JHan, P.S Yu.

The association rules are as shown in table 5. The similarities  between the path of e-shopper CID016  and the derived rules are 22016 =SD and 11016 =SD . Therefore, e-shopper CID016 belongs to the ninth cluster at timeT , since the fitness between CID016 and the rules are =FD2016 0.2 and =FD 1 016 0.2001. Therefore, we predict that the products which e-shopper CID016 is likely to buy are Bread, and Biscuit  TABLE V.

In this study, we describe a new approach for mining the changes of e-shopper  purchase behavior over time and discuss solutions to several problems. For predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior, the following concepts are proposed: BP j SDij and FDij . The SOM technique is used to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. The purchase sequences are derived from the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper. The sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. Then the sequential purchase patterns are stored in the rule database Finally, we give the example to elaborate the new methodology. The research presented in this paper makes a 155 contribution to mining  e-shoppers purchase behavior basing on transaction data. E-retailer may be able to perform effective  one-to-one marketing campaigns by providing individual target e-shoppers with personalized Product basing on using purchase sequences In the future, some possible extensions to this work are as 


follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
