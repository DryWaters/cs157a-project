The poor reasoning performance is indicative of the inability of current DL-based reasoners to scale over a large number of triples, especi ally when rules are involved In Table IV we examine the measurements about Books@HPCLab_revised TABLE IV B OOKS HPCL AB _ REVISED PERFORMANCE  Query Load Time Reasoning Time triples results Web 2.0 80 12 69576 95 Web 2.0 applications 83 7 69576 99 Programming in java 108 9 69576 90 Java 113 16 69576 88 In this case, load times are found somewhat reduced \(Fig 8\: indeed, we now make fewer calls to the eBay API, by asking for multiple book offers in one request, thus resulting in fewer costly requests overall. The huge performance improvement is however in reasoning Fig. 9\otice a reduction in reasoning time by almost an order of magnitude, which cannot be justified by the different hardware: Clearly SPARQL queries are rapid when compared to the DL-based cl assification and the forward chaining algorithm of the triple store pays off 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Web 2.0 Web 2.0 applications programming in java java Load Time \(sec Books@HPCLab Books@HPCLab_revised Figure 8 Load time comparison per query 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Web 2.0 Web 2.0 applications programming in java java Reasoning Time \(sec Books@HPCLab Books@HPCLab_revised Figure 9 Reasoning time comparison per query In fact, the actual reasoning time for Books@HPCLab_revised has been included in the load time: Each time a new query dataset gets added to the store all the rules are fired and new triples are computed, based on total materialization. Besides, the most part of it includes the overhead to transfer the da taset to the store over HTTP In contrast, Books@HPCLab lo ads the ontologies directly from the disk. Therefore, ‘reasoning time’ would simply amount to the evaluation of the SPARQL query and results fetch Notice also that the number of triples for each query has increased. This is because we now reason over the whole dataset, i.e. the sum of triples produced by every query. To this, one should add the 450 triples found in the schema ontology \(BookShop\hat are loaded in the repository during initialization. Still, even though the triple count has quadrupled, the new implementation hugely outperforms its predecessor in terms of reasoning performance. To the DLbased reasoner’s advocacy we have to add OWLim’s inability to reason about datatypes. The latter can be easily integrated in SWRL with the use of built-ins [7 te also  the fact that the BookShop ontology falls into the ‘OWL Horst’ dialect, a proper subset of OWL 2-RL an d on l y  a small subset of OWL 2-DL, which the DL reasoner is able to provide sound and complete reasoning for VII C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK One of the greatest features Semantic Web has to offer is undoubtedly reasoning-based querying. Linked Data is another important dimension which enables opening linking and sharing information in machine understandable formats. However, it often appears to disregard the strong semantic underpinnings the Semantic Web comes with; and this due to the high complexity and stiff scalability of reasoning, especially for expressive languages. In this paper we have shown that a reasonable compromise can be achieved by relying on rule-based reasoning.  By combining linked data and rules we can produce meaningful addedvalue, oriented towards user recommendation, with controlled and scalable performance costs 
95 


At the same time, we have set up a prototype that can bootstrap semantic personalization services with Linked Data coming from legacy contexts. Our semantic mashup actually triplifies and links data from different sources that can be independently consumed later by other applications In addition, it can act as an independent framework for efficient management of rule-based ontologies; the component design is oblivious to the underlying business logic \(e.g. Java, servlets the front-end implementation e.g. PHP Having eliminated reasoning times, mashup creation requests are mainly responsible for lowering overall performance. An obvious improvement would be the asynchronous processing of these requests and loading the datasets to the triple store littl e-by-little or caching, in case of repeated queries, since datasets are already persistent More succinct data formats may also be necessary, since RDF/XML appears quite verbose and can put a considerable communication overhead. To this end, JSON http://json.org, http://json-ld.org e an a lternative for data serialization. Finally, the use of datatype operators inside rules comes in handy, although it can be mimicked by SPARQL queries. To this di rection the consideration of triple stores like OWLIM to express rules in SPARQL-like format appears promising R EFERENCES 1 B B i s h op A  K i r y a k ov  D O g n y a nof f  I  P e ik ov  Z.

First, transaction clustering is conducted, so that all the transactions of e-shoppers are clustered. The SOM technique is used to cluster target e-shoppers transactions Then it is necessary to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. These e-shopper behaviors, which are derived from a change in the cluster number of each e-shopper, are kept in the purchase sequence database. Finally sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. The sequential purchase patterns are then stored in the association rule database Although SOM technique can obtains transaction clusters SOM clustering technique often breaks down when handling very high-dimensional data. So it is proposed that using product classes represents the hierarchical relationships among products. The method can make an effective dimensionality reduction while improving clustering results Assume that a product class set P  is classified into n different subclasses, and that each subclass consists of subclasses at a lower level, or eventual leaf products, as follows PPPPP nn ,, 121 ?= "                          \(1 Suppose that C is the set of the transactions of m e-shoppers during s periods before timeT . More specifically letC be composed as follows CCC kTmkTkTC ???= ,,2,1 ,, "                   \(2 11,0 ?= sk "  2?s WhereC kTj ?, ?C  is a non-empty subset of products Each C kTj ?,  represents the product class or classes from which e-shopper j purchased products at time kT EveryC kTj ?,  is transformed into an input matrix composed of a bit vector, and the matrix to be transformed is used in the transaction clustering. The time-ordered vectors for a particular e-shopper represent the purchasing history of the 


e-shopper; this input matrix can be thought of as the dynamic profile of the e-shopper. A dynamic e-shopper profile is defined as follows Let C _ be a dynamic e-shopper profile. Then, C _ is defined by the following matrix for n product classes and m e-shoppers over the course of s periods  3 mj "2,1 11,0 ?= sk " 2?s Where                         1 if Pi?C kTj   All the transactions of e-shoppers in the training e-shopper purchase database are transformed into dynamic e-shopper profiles based on their prior purchase behaviors. Then we use the SOM clustering technique to assign each transaction to a group. This transaction clustering facilitates the discovery of the dynamic cluster sequence of e-shopper The transaction clustering results in the following set of q clusters DDDD q"21 ,=                             \(4 Where each Di is a subset of C _ the given in \(3 A rearrangement of these clusters by  e-shopper  and by time  period is necessary for the identification of the dynamic behavior of each e-shopper. It is possible to learn the cluster sequence of a e-shopper by identifying the cluster to which each transaction of the e-shopper belongs, during each time period. To formalize this concept, we use the following terminology Let BP j be the behavior pattern of e-shopper j . Then, the behavior pattern BPi is identical to the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper j during s periods and is defined as follows  5 Where D kTj ?, ?D ,11,0 ?= sk "  2?s The  process  of searching for  a behavior path can 


be simply conducted through transaction clustering. All e-shoppers  have  a behavior path based on their prior transactions. The association rule technique is well suited for determining the most frequent pattern with confidence, since it provides automatic filtering capabilities. To discover the behavior path of a target e-shopper at time T based on his/her past behavior, the input data should be divided into a conditional part and a consequential part. Association rules are descriptive patterns of the form X?Y, where X and Y are statements regarding the values of attributes of an instance in a database. X is termed the left-hand-side, and is the conditional part of an association rule. Meanwhile, Y is called the right-hand-side, and is the consequent part. The conditional part is composed of the left-hand-side assigned to the consequential part R j represents the association rule about the user specified minimum support and confidence in the following form R j 6 A rule R j  indicates that, if the path of a e-shopper is DD TjsTj 1,1, , ?+? " , then the behavior cluster for that e-shopper is D Tj, at timeT It is necessary to know the degree to which the behavior path of a target e-shopper during 1?s periods beforeT  is similar to the association rule. The cluster path of a target e-shopper, transformed via the SOM, is compared with the association rules derived from other e-shoppers paths, and then the best-matching path is determined. Execution of this 0 if Otherwise    C kTj 154 process requires new measures for calculating the degree of correspondence between the association rules and the behavior path of a target e-shopper. This similarity measure is defined as follows     


1 1  s i i kTj i j SSD                            \(7 Where        1 if RD kTikTi   Si kTj 0 otherwise mj "2,1 11,0 ?= sk " 2?s ni "2,1 The above definition indicates that, if the behavior path of a target e-shopper i is equal to the conditional part of association rule j in the same period, then S j kTi ?,  is equal to one, otherwise is equal to zero. However, even if the similarity measure is high, a choice of the association rule suited to the prediction of the cluster of a target e-shopper at timeT is difficult, since such a rule is not general, given that the support and confidence of the association rule may be remarkably low. Therefore, to assure a good fit between the behavior path of a target e-shopper and the conditional part of the association rule, it is necessary to measure fitness. Fitness is defined as follows Suppose FDij be a degree of the goodness-of-fit between the behavior path i and the association rule j . Then, FDij is defined as follows ConfidenceSupportSDFD jjjiij = ,             \(8 Using the above definition, we can determine the cluster of a target e-shopper at timeT is a consequential part R Tj, of the association rule j with maximum FDij IV.  ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE In this paper, we use Table 3 as example given to illustrate proposed method. The set of product classes given in Table 3 is P={Candy, Can, Milk, Bread, Biscuit}. The transactions of e-shopper CID006 are C June,006 {Candy}, =C May,006 {Can}, =C July,006 {Milk 


Therefore, the dynamic purchase profile of CID006 buying the set of products {Candy, Can, Milk Bread, Biscuit} from May to July may be represented as { }0,0,0,0,1,006 _ C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,006 _ C May and 0,0,1,0,0,006 _ C July . CID016 and CID006 are exactly same as both bought the same products during the same month Therefore, similarly, the transactions of target e-shopper CID016 are =C June,016 {Candy} and =C May,016 {Can The dynamic purchase profile of CID016 buying the products may be represented as 0,0,0,0,1,016 _ C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,016 _ C May TABLE IV.

The association rules are as shown in table 5. The similarities  between the path of e-shopper CID016  and the derived rules are 22016 =SD and 11016 =SD . Therefore, e-shopper CID016 belongs to the ninth cluster at timeT , since the fitness between CID016 and the rules are =FD2016 0.2 and =FD 1 016 0.2001. Therefore, we predict that the products which e-shopper CID016 is likely to buy are Bread, and Biscuit  TABLE V.

In this study, we describe a new approach for mining the changes of e-shopper  purchase behavior over time and discuss solutions to several problems. For predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior, the following concepts are proposed: BP j SDij and FDij . The SOM technique is used to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. The purchase sequences are derived from the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper. The sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. Then the sequential purchase patterns are stored in the rule database Finally, we give the example to elaborate the new methodology. The research presented in this paper makes a 155 contribution to mining  e-shoppers purchase behavior basing on transaction data. E-retailer may be able to perform effective  one-to-one marketing campaigns by providing individual target e-shoppers with personalized Product basing on using purchase sequences In the future, some possible extensions to this work are as 


follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
