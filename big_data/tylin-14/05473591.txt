In real data mining applications, more and more researchers realized the need from traditional data mining to knowledge discovery to deliver useful knowledge for the business decision-making. Thus, actionable knowledge discovery is introduced during the context. This study draws on analysis of the applications of actionable knowledge discovery and draws conclusions for researchers about its applications in future Keywordsdata mining; actionable knowledge discovery; association rule mining I. INTRODUCTION Real-world data mining generally must consider and involve domain and business oriented factors such as human knowledge, constraints and business expectations. Classic data mining is heavily dependent on data itself, and relies on data-centered methodologies. Existing approaches either view data mining as an autonomous data-driven trial-and-error process, or analyze business issues in an isolated and caseby-case manner [1]. As a result, very often the knowledge discovered does not always generally satisfy real business needs Thus, this encourages the development of a domain driven methodology to strengthen data-centered pattern mining Actually, data mining applications should meet in domain driven, actionable knowledge discovery in the real world It is necessary to address business interestingness and successfully deliver knowledge and patterns that are actionable and dependable [2]. Domain driven data mining targets such challenges and objectives Cao and Zhang [3] stated that domain driven, actionable 


knowledge discovery should involve, support and integrate the following intelligence and constraints: domain experts role and computational capability, domain knowledge and intelligence, network and web intelligence, in-depth data intelligence, and the constrained environment and deliverable in specific domains. With the development of actionable knowledge discovery in real applications, this paper aims to review and summarize some recent applications under the methodology The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces some basic concepts of actionable knowledge discovery. Section III reviews some applications related to actionable knowledge discovery. Discussions and future work are concluded in final section II. ACTIONABLE KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY This section will introduce the basic concepts of actionable knowledge discovery and association rule mining under the methodology A. Basic Concepts Data mining and knowledge discovery has emerged to be one of the most vivacious areas in information technology during the last decade. It has boosted a major academic and industrial campaign crossing many traditional areas such as database, statistics, business as well as emergent disciplines for example, genetics Compared with the booming fact in academia, data mining applications in the real world has not been as active and charming of academic research. With many years of development of this promising scientific field, it is time and worthwhile to review the major issues blocking the step of Knowledge Discovery from Database \(KDD use widely. A picture of traditional data mining can be summarized as the following aspects [4 Object mined: data is the object being mined, which is expected to tell the whole story of a concern Data sets mined are abstract or refined from real problems or data. Mining is not directly conducted on raw data from business Models and methods in data mining systems are usually predefined. It is the data mining researcher rather than a user that can deploy an algorithm The process of data mining is packed as automated, in 


which a user is not necessary and actually he/she cannot do much in the mining procedure The evaluation of mined results is basically based on technical metrics, if a threshold presumed by data mining researchers is higher, then the algorithm is promising The accuracy of an algorithm is taken as one of key criteria of quality judgment 978-1-4244-5874-5/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE While after the origin of data mining, researchers with strong industrial engagement realized the need from data mining to knowledge discovery to deliver useful knowledge for the business decision making. Many researchers, especially early career researchers in KDD, are still only or mainly focusing on mining for patterns in data. The main reason for such a dominant situation, either explicitly or implicitly, is on its originally narrow focus and overemphasized by innovative data-driven or algorithm-driven research Knowledge discovery is further expected to migrate into Actionable Knowledge Discovery \(AKD knowledge that can be delivered in the form of businessfriendly and decision-making actions, and can be taken over by business people seamlessly. So a new KDD methodology on top of the traditional data-centered pattern mining framework, that is Domain Driven Data Mining \(D3M by Cao and Zhang [1 The motivation of D3M is to view KDD as AKDbased problem-solving systems through developing effective methodologies, methods and tools. The aim of D3M is to make AKD system deliver business-friendly and decisionmaking rules and actions that are of solid technical significance as well. D3M caters for the effective involvement of ubiquitous intelligence surrounding AKD based problemsolving. Some of them are illustrated as follows [4 Data intelligence, tells stories hidden in the data about a business problem Domain intelligence, refers to domain resources that not only wrap a problem and its target data but also assist in the understanding and problem-solving of the problem. Domain intelligence consists of qualitative and quantitative intelligence. Both types of intelligence are instantiated in terms of aspects such as domain knowl 


edge, background information, constraints, organization factors and business process, as well as environment intelligence, business expectation and interestingness Human intelligence, refers to \(1 involvement of humans such as empirical knowledge belief, intention and expectation, run-time supervision evaluating, and expert group; \(2 involvement of human intelligence such as imaginary thinking, emotional intelligence, inspiration, brainstorm and reasoning inputs Social intelligence, consists of interpersonal intelligence emotional intelligence, social cognition, consensus construction, group decision, as well as organizational factors, business process, workflow, project management and delivery, social network intelligence, collective interaction, business rules, law, trust and so on D3M consists of a domain-driven in-depth pattern discovery framework [5] through the following contents Mining constraint-based context Incorporating domain knowledge through humanmachine-cooperation Mining in-depth patterns Enhancing knowledge actionability Supporting loop-closed iterative refinement in order to enhance knowledge actionability B. Combined Association Rule Mining In real application of data mining, the mining of association rules for discerning a relationship between data items in large databases with representative methods. The basic terminologies of association rule, Support and Confidence are defined in [6]. Lift is also an interesting index of association rules. For example, consider rule AR: If A then B Suppose the probability of B is 0.4, the value of confidence is 0.8, then Lift=2. Thus, to the rule AR, the value of Lift greater than 1 indicates that the occurrence of A has a positive effect on the occurrence of B Combined rule is further extracted from single rule, which generated through association rule mining. In general, a combined rule is composed of multiple heterogeneous itemsets from different datasets. Combined patterns take the forms of combined association rules, which are defined as [7 Based on traditional Support, Confidence and Lift, two 


new lifts are designed for measuring the interestingness of combined association rules \(see [7 III. ACTIONABLE KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY APPLICATIONS Some applications of actionable knowledge discovery are summarized in this section A. Customer Relationship Management Customer Relationship Management \(CRM four dimensions: Customer identification, customer attraction, customer retention, and customer development [8 Customer satisfaction is the central concern for customer retention. Prior research suggests that customer satisfaction is an important source of competitive advantages, often leading to customer loyalty and repeat purchase Customer retention is an significant component in customer relationship management. Zhang et al. [9] employed association rule mining for customer retention with the help of expert domain knowledge. Du et al. [10] stated to find the satisfaction patterns of customers with the help of association rule mining, intuitionistic fuzzy set and ?-cuts In the meantime, in order to express the conscientious and careful of academy, authors of the above references declared that as poster papers included in the proceedings, are not the final manuscripts but their carelessness in the process of submission. Zhang et al. [11] used combined association rule mining to assist customers to pay off a debt in the shortest possible time B. Supplier Selection Supplier selection is one of the most parts in supply chain management. Strategic partnership with better performing suppliers should be integrated into the manufacturing to improve the performance in various aspects including reducing costs by eliminating wastes, continuously improving quality to achieve zero defects, reducing lead time at different stages of the manufacturing, and so on. Xu and Lin [12 used Analytic Hierarchy Process \(AHP mining to find key suppliers. In order words, first, use association rule algorithm to classify the parts based on the shipment records in order to find supplier sets \(supplier clusters clusters combined with a relative ranking \(through AHP suppliers who provide parts needed 


C. Crime Identification Crime detection for credit applications is so popular in bank industry. Phua et al. [13] presented an updated adaptive Communal Analysis Suspicion Scoring \(CASS CASS adaptively changes the appropriate parameter setting to trade off efficiency and effectiveness. Their approach is validated with three sets of experiments on real credit applications D. Business Intelligence Business Intelligence \(BI nologies, applications and practices used to support decision making. BI technologies provide historical, current, and predictive views of business operations. Peng et al. [14 proposed semi-automatic system and methods to iteratively discover leading indicators from real-time work-flow events equipment logs, and other metrics sources. The approach uses domain knowledge to filter indicators, and enables incremental adjustment of underlying domain model thorough involving domain knowledge E. Blog-Specific Search and Mining Recently, blog-specific search and mining techniques are popular. Latent semantic analysis and probabilistic latent semantic analysis based probabilistic models are investigated for mining business blogs. Chen et al. [15] stated that domain driven data mining can better strengthen business intelligence in complex business applications Generally, actionable knowledge discovery aims to find actionable pattern or knowledge for decision making. Furthermore, decision making process relies on more than one factor or condition. Actually, in real-life application, every target problem often relates to many different datasets. In other words, depth analysis of the correlation among different datasets is necessary for generating actionable knowledge IV. DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To conclude, actionable knowledge discovery is becoming more and more popular in real data mining applications This study summarizes some research domains concerned on actionable knowledge discovery. Future research can be involved more issues such as text mining. Furthermore, in order to find more actionable knowledge, techniques such as fuzzy set theory and ontology, can be employed for the study of actionable knowledge discovery

For example, the associations rule 871? 870 throughout the period included on the database is valid. The associations rule 923? 934 in the time period December 24, 2003 to February 19, 2004 and the time period March 12, 2004 to May 21, 2004 as these two time periods is effective. The above association rules are graphically represented in Figure 1 as follows  20038-1 20038-31

Time periods of association rule To compare the algorithm execution time under the different support for the association rule with time, the result is shown in Figure 2. From the Figure 2, when the algorithm is in a high support, efficiency is very high with the increase of support. Particularly, when support is small the algorithm is much less efficient. This is because the result of uneven distribution of the data. The adventure works sales data in the database are distributed unevenly so that some of the basic window data is very dense under the 


low support. Hence, the algorithm will produce a large number of large itemsets, resulting in reduced efficiency of the algorithm. Therefore, the algorithm under the even data distribution can achieve better results 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 0.2 0.1 0.08 0.04 t s  Figure 2.  The algorithm execution time under the different support V. CONCLUSION This paper studies the dynamic association rules with time, based on the time vector to represent the dynamic association rules. We propose an algorithm that can mine the dynamic association rules. These dynamic association rules include some practical significance in what time period will appear on the association rules. The numerical experiments show that the algorithm can efficiently reduce the number of the scanning database within the less execution time. In addition, there are some limitations of the algorithm, such as some large itemsets may be lost and sensitive to the change of support.

While focusing on the sample cost and using the strata that are more likely to contain tuples where A = a is clearly important, variance of estimation is another important issue, since it corresponds to the error of estimation. Thus, we de?ne the integrated cost by taking into account the variance of estimation 2s and the sampling cost SampCost Cost = ?s  SampCost + ?v  ?2s \(5 where ?s and ?v are weights for sampling cost and estimate variance, respectively, such that their sum is 1. Users could set the two weights based on the importance they attach to these two factors. For example, if response to a query is needed quickly sampling cost should have a higher weightage The relation between input attributes and output attributes, as well as data distribution, are modeled by a tree built on the query space recursively. Each node in the tree represents a query subspace, and is associated with a query that comprises speci?c values for a subset of input attributes, the sample size, as well as the potential splitting attributes. The sample size shows how many data records would be drawn from the subpopulation of the node Algorithm 1 shows the process of splitting a node N , which as we stated above, is associated with the query Q, the sample size s, and a list of potential splitting attributes, PS. The inputs of the algorithm also include set Lf , which represents leaf nodes of the tree. At the beginning, the entire query space is represented by the root node. The corresponding query of the root node is null the sample size n is the size of the sample that is to be drawn from the entire population, and the potential splitting attributes list is the complete set of input attributes of this data source. The initial set of leaf nodes is empty The main goal of the algorithm is to split the query tree in a greedy way. For each potential splitting attribute, the integrated cost after splitting is computed according to the Expression 5. The input attribute which brings the most reduction in the integrated cost is selected. More speci?cally, ?rst, the integrated cost for the subpopulation of the node N is calculated. If this value is smaller than a prede?ned threshold ?, node N is set to be a leaf node \(Lines 2-5 considering the set of potential splitting attributes PS \(Lines 621 would be |DIA| strata under the space of node N . The integrated cost on |DIA| strata is computed. Let M ? PS with domain DM 


denote the input attribute with the minimum integrated cost after the split, and let the set of allocated sample sizes, computed by the sample allocation method explained later, be ASM . Then DM | children are generated for the node M . For each child CHi, i = 1, . . . , |DM |, the associated query is QN ?{M = mi sample size is asi ? ASM , and potential splitting attributes is PSN ? M . The process of splitting is then recursively applied to children of node N In the process of calculating costs during the strati?cation process, we need to perform sample allocation, i.e., divide the parent nodes sample size among the potential children nodes This is required for calculating the integrated cost for the potential split. This is based on our sample allocation method, which we 328 describe next in Section IV-B. Furthermore, for calculating the integrated cost, the variance of target value ?2i and probability of output attribute A = a, ?i, for each stratum is computed based on the pilot sample Initially, the strati?cation process on the query space begins by calling Stratification\(R, null, F IA, n, null root node. The process of strati?cation would stop if there is no leaf node with integrated cost larger than a prede?ned threshold Each leaf node in the tree is a ?nal stratum for sampling, and the associated sample size denotes the number of data records drawn from the subpopulation of the stratum B. An Optimized Sample Allocation Method Now, we introduce our optimized algorithm for sample allocation which integrates variance reduction and sampling cost As introduced in section IV-A, integrated cost is de?ned by taking into account of variance of estimation and sampling cost The goal of our sample allocation algorithm is to minimize the integrated cost by choosing the sample size, ni, for each stratum In our algorithm, we adjust the value of SampCost and ?2s so that their in?uences on the integrated cost are in the same unit SampCost SampCost SmpCost\(r where SmpCost\(r entire population, and ?r denotes the probability of A = a being true for the entire population 2 2s 


2r where ?2r 2 n denotes the variance of estimation of the target value on the entire population The key constraint on the values of the sample sizes for each strata is that their sum should be equal to the total sample size A vector n = {n1, n2, . . . , nH} is used to represent the sample sizes, where the ith element, ni, is the sample size for the ith stratum By including sampling cost and variance of estimation into the integrated cost, our sample size determination task leads to the following optimization problem Minimize Cost\(n  i\(?s ni i v N2i niN2 2 i subject to  i ni = n 6 where Ni denotes the population size of data records under the space of A = a in ith stratum. Note that this value may not be known if A is an output attribute. However, the total number of records in the ith stratum is typically known, and can be denoted as DNi. Then Ni can be estimated by ?iDNi, and the population size of A = a on the entire population is estimated by N  i ?i DNi For ?nding the minimum of integrated cost, we utilize Lagrange multipliers, a well know optimization method. Lagrange multipliers aims at ?nding the extrema of a function object to constraints. Using this approach, a new variable ? called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced and de?ned by n n  


 i ni ? n If n is a minimum solution for the original constrained problem then there exists a ? such that \(n Lagrange function. Stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of ?\(n n,??\(n 7 In our problem, by conducting partial derivatives on Formula 7 a group of equations are yielded as follows s i v N 2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? = 0 i = 1, ..H i ni = n 8 where the solution n leads to the minimum value of integrated cost in Formula 5 However, it is dif?cult to solve the group of equations directly Thus, we use numerical analysis to approximate the real solution. Newtons method is utilized for ?nding successively better approximations to the zeroes \(or roots Given an equation f\(x x tive of function f\(x method iteratively provides, xt+1, a better approximation of the root, based on xt, the previous approximation of root according to the following formula xt+1 = xt ? f\(xt f ?\(xt The iteration is repeated until a suf?ciently accurate value is reached, i.g. |f\(xt In our problem of Formula 8, there are H + 1 equations F \(xt xt xt n1, .., nH , ?}, where the equations in F \(xt fi\(xt s i v N 


2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? i = 1, .., H fH+1\(xt  i ni ? n The Newtons method is also applied iteratively via the system of linear equations JF \(xt xt+1 ? xt xt 9 where JF \(xt H + 1 H + 1 equation system F \(xt vector xt. The entry JF \(i, j d\(fi\(x dxj where fi\(x xt x From the Expression 9, a better approximation xt+1 is obtained based on previous approximation xt. The iterative procedure would be stopped if ?i|fi\(xt threshold, and then the sample size ni is allocated for each stratum so that the integrated cost is minimized. In reality, we are required to pick an integral number of records from each stratum during the sampling step. Thus, we round down each ni to its nearest integer, ni + 0.5 In the example shown in Table I, suppose we set both weights v and ?s to be 0.5. Further, assume the variance of the entire population, ?2r , to be 80000. The probability of A = a over the entire population ?r is 0.242. By using the proposed optimized sample allocation method, the sample sizes for the three strata 329 are 162, 299, and 139, respectively. In this case, the variance of estimation according to the Expression 2 is 93.66, and the estimated cost is 1943.7. We can see that, compared with Neyman allocation, the sampling cost is decreased by 42.1%, but results some increase in variance. Overall, this example shows that we can achieve lower sampling cost by trading off some accuracy C.

EVALUATION STUDY We evaluate our sampling methods for association mining and differential rule mining on the deep web using two datasets described below US Census data set: This is a 9-attribute real-life data set obtained from the 2008 US Census on the income of US households. This data set contains 40,000 data records with 7 categorical attributes about the race, age, and education level of the husband and wife of each household and 2 numerical attributes about the incomes of husband and wife 


Yahoo! data set: The Yahoo! data set, which consists of the data crawled from a subset of a real-world hidden database at http://autos.yahoo.com/. Particularly, we download the data on used cars located within 50 miles of a zipcode address. This yields 30,000 data records. The data consists of 7-attribute with 6 categorical attributes about the age, mileage, brand, etc, of the cars and one numerical attribute, which is the price of the car Variance of Estimation is estimated for the target value \(i.e mean value in differential rule mining, and con?dence in association rule mining is calculated according to the Expression 2. Since variance of estimation reveals the variation of the estimated value from the true value, smaller variance suggests better estimation Sampling Cost is estimated by the number of queries submitted to data sources in order to acquire a certain number of data records containing target output attributes, i.e. A = a. Larger sample size implies higher sampling costs in a deep web setting where the queries are executed over the internet Estimate accuracy is estimated by Absolute Error Rate \(AER Small AER value indicates higher accuracy. For an estimator on variable Y with true value y and estimated value y, the AER of the estimator is calculated by AER\(y A. Association Rule Mining In this section, we present the results of our method for association rule mining. Using our overall approach, we have created four different versions, which correspond to four different sets of weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling costs. 1 the weight ?v = 1.0 and ?s = 0.0, 2 the weight ?v = 0.7 and ?s = 0.3, 3 v = 0.5 and ?s = 0.5, and 4 weights ?v = 0.3 and ?s = 0.7. In addition, we also compare these approaches with a simple random sampling method, which is denoted by Random We focus on the queries in the form of A = a ? B = b where A and B are output categorical attributes. Other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes Our goal is to estimate Supp\(A=a,B=b A=a association rules are randomly selected from the datasets. Each of the 50 association rules are re-processed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations result is the average result for 5000 executions 


In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
