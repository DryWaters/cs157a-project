The aim of data mining is extract the information from database and generate clear and understandable description of patterns In this study we have introduced a new approach to generate association rules on numeric data. We propose a modified equal width binning interval approach to discretizing continuous valued attributes. The approximate width of the desired intervals is chosen based on the opinion of medical expert and is provided as an input parameter to the model First we have converted numeric attributes into categorical form based on above techniques. Apriori algorithm is usually used for the market basket analysis was used to generate rules on Pima Indian diabetes data. The data set was taken from UCI machine learning repository containing total instances 768 and 8 numeric attributes.We discover that the often neglected pre-processing steps in knowledge discovery are the most critical elements in determining the success of a data mining application. Lastly we have generated the association rules which are useful to identify general associations in the data, to understand the relationship between the measured fields whether the patient goes on to develop diabetes or not. We are presented step-by-step approach to help the health doctors to explore their data and to understand the discovered rules better Keywords- association rule data mining, classification medical diagnosis I.  INTRODUCTION In recent times, the number of people suffering from diabetes is increasing day by day. It is a disease in which body does not produce insulin or use it properly. This increase the risks of developing, kidney disease, blindness nerve damage, blood vessel damage and contribute to heart 


disease [1]. There are two types of diabetes one Type-1 is also called insulin dependent and type-2 diabetes is with relative insulin deficiency. Patients with type 2 diabetes do not require insulin cure to remain alive, although up to 20 are treated with insulin to control blood glucose levels [2 To diagnose diabetes disease at an early stage is quite a challenging task due to complex inter dependence on various factors. There is a critical need to develop medical diagnostic decision support systems which can aid medical practitioners in the diagnostic process In medical domain, a number of methods are used to generate the rule from databases. In [3] authors did the experiment on three medical data bases and generated the rules and then compared these rules with predefined rules. In 4] authors proposed that rule of diagnosing diabetes in such that away if one person has three of the four symptoms of type-2 diabetes, namely Blood Pressure 140/90mmHg, HDL cholesterol<35mg/dl, Central obesity, Triglycerides 150mg/dl, the patients will be  decided as having Metabolic Syndrome patient. In [5] authors have used association rule and decision trees to extract knowledge from medical databases. They proved that results obtained are very promising. In [6] authors proposed a technique for generating contrast sets describing the differences between two groups, where the antecedents contain one categorical attribute describing group membership and the consequents contain up to two continuous-valued attributes.  In our proposed method, we first applied the data pre-processing to improve the quality of data. Next step is discretize the continuous values and then converted it categorical values based on approximate equal interval binning technique and advice from medical experts. It is essential to obtain the consistent rules in medical databases to make decision for medical support system The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we briefly discuss the proposed method. We present the results in Section II. Conclusion and future work is highlighted in section IV  II. PROPOSED METHOD In the first stage of our proposed study, we used preprocessing in order to handle the missing values. Later we 


applied equal interval binning with approximate values based on medical expert advice to Pima Indian diabetes data. Lastly we applied apriori association rule algorithm to generate the rules. We also consider two important measures coverage and confidence. The framework is shown in Fig.1 A. Dataset The, Pima Indian Diabetes dataset used was obtained from UCI machine learning repository [7].A study was conducted on 768 randomly selected Pima Indian female patients whose age was at least 21. Characteristics of the patients like number of times of pregnancy and age in years were recorded. Some other important parameters like plasma glucose concentration every 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test, diastolic blood pressure \(mm Hg 2010 Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing 978-0-7695-3977-5/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/ICMLC.2010.67 330 Pima Indian diabetes data Data preprocessing Approximate equal binning based on Expert advice Apriori association algorithm Association Rules

Data preprocessing In real world, data is not always complete and in the case of the medical data, it is always true. To remove the number of inconsistencies which are associated with data we use Data preprocessing. Many data preprocessing techniques are given in [8] [9]. During this study we removed instances which had zero values for the attributes  Pregnant, Plasma Glucose, DiastolicBP and BMI. We also not included two attributes triceps skin fold thickness & 2-hour serum insulin As they represent have 227 zero values and 374 zero values In [10] the authors has proved that list wise deletion is an efficient technique instead of replacing the values with techniques like mean, mode, random imputation, two regression imputations, and a Bayesian model-based procedure. After the pre-processing only 625 instances are remain out of 768 


   TABLE I FEATUREs IN PIMA INDIAN DIABETES DATA SET  C. Approximate equal binning techniques based on expert advice After the preprocessing only the 625 instances  remain with  6 attribute age, pregnant, plasma glucose, diastolic BP BMI, DPF and age. Classification of general associations requires categorical data. The data variables are binned in to small number of categories. We have used approximate equal interval binning and also taken advice from medical experts. The following summarizes the cut-off values along with the names of the bins for the variables  Pregnant: low \(1,2 3,4,5 6 PlasmaGlucose: low \(< 90 90150 high \(> 150 Diastolic-BP: normal \(< 80 8090 high \(> 90 BMI: low \(< 25 2530 3035 obese \(> 35 DPF: low \(< 0.4 0.40.8 0.8 Age: 2039\(young medium high Class: yes \(1 0  By using above said cutoff values all the 625 instances are converted into the categorical data which is shown in Table II      Feature in data          Description Type Pregnant A record of the number of times the patient pregnant Numeric PlasmaGlucose Plasma glucose concentration

 D. A ssociation rule mining algorithm Agarawal et al. proposed the first association mining algorithm which pointed out that there are hidden relationships among the purchased items in transactional databases [11] [12]. For example, there are associations between items such as bread and milk, which are often purchased together in a single basket transaction. An association rule is defined as association between X and Y is in the form X?Y, where X and Y are both frequent item sets in the given database. The intersection for X and Y is empty set. They have used two important measures to find the association among the transaction items one is support other is confidence. The support of the rule X? Y is the percentage of transactions in the given database that contain both X and Y, P\(X U Y Y as the percentage of transactions in the given database containing X that also contains Y  1. Apriori- algorithm  A first well-designed association rule mining method Apriori [11] [12] that describe item sets that satisfy a minimum support criterion.  These item sets to generate are used rules that satisfy a minimum confidence criterion. In this algorithm transactions were executed iteratively in a level-wise approach. i.e item sets containing one items were processed first, then item sets with two items were processed, and the process was repeated, continuously adding one  item each time, until prescribed  criteria were met  as explained below  A number of researchers developed advanced algorithms [14], [15] [16] [17] [18] but, the original Apriori is still the most popular one and becomes a standard function. Apriori is an important association rule mining algorithm that is incorporated in many data mining software Basically association rule works in two steps: \(1 item sets that pass a minimum support threshold; and \(2 generating rules that pass a minimum confidence threshold It is very difficult to find the right threshold. If low support 


may increase rules High support may missing of some important rule. If support is high then the   confidence will low vice versa.  WEKA   incorporated in implementation 13]. The Apriori algorithm is given in [19] as follows in Table III TABLE-III ALGORITHM APRIORI  Algorithm Apriori Parameters given by users are UpperMinSupport, Lower MinSupport, Delta, Criterion, MinScore, and NumRules 1.

RESULTS After the converting continuous variable into the categorical variables we have applied the apriori algorithm to find the hidden relationship between the variables. All the 


rules described here include all the combination and all risk factors that develop the diabetes within five year or not Association rules are nothing different from classification rules except that does not predict only class labels but also 332 predict any other attribute. It has freedom to produce a combination of attributes. Different association rules convey different regularities that trigger in the data set and generally predict the different things and so many association rule generated from even the data set is small. We keep such rules which are applicable reasonably large number of instances based on coverage and accuracy criteria. The coverage of an association rule is the number of instances for which it predicts correctlythis is often called its support Its accuracy often called confidence is the number of instances that it predicts correctly, expressed as proportion of all instances to which it applies. The user has to specify the minimum coverage and accuracy values and look for only those rules whose values are at least of the specified minimum value  The Pima Indian diabetes data set would result in an enormous number of association rules, which would then have to be pruned down on the basis of their coverage and accuracy. Assuming that the minimum specified accuracy is 100%, only the first of these rules will make it into the final rule set. The algorithm, which is given in Table III is implemented in WEKA, and will generate those top ten strongest rules for diabetes= yes which are shown in Table IV. Where as diabetes is equal = no, given in Table V. For example rule 1 the coverage is   74 and confidence is 100  TABLE-IV RULE GENERATED BY THE ASSOCIATION ALGORITHM PATIENTS BELONGS TO CLASS YES     TABLE-IV RULE GENERATED BY THE ASSOCIATION 


ALGORITHM PATIENTS BELONGS TO CLASS =NO IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this proposed study, we used preprocessing to improve the quality of data. Next we applied equal interval binning with approximate values based on medical expert advice to Pima Indian diabetes data. Than we applied apriori association rule algorithm to generate the rules. The generalization of rule may be further improved by considering the factors which influence the diabetes. But which are not included in the present study. In this paper we have included only type-2 diabetic patients those who are pregnant woman below 21 years REFERENCES  1] E.I.Mohamed, R.Linderm, G.Perriello,N.Daniele, S.J.Poppl A.DeLorenzo.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
