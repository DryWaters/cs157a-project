           A Nov el Approach to Prune Mined Association Rules in Large Databases    D.Narmadha 1 G.NaveenSundar 2 S.Geetha 3 Co mputer Science Department, Karunya University, India 1 nar madha_prabha@yahoo.co.in 2 gg naveengg@gmail.com 3 geethadee pa@yahoo.co.in  Abst ract Association rule mining finds interesting associations and/or correlation relationships among large set of data items. Association rules shows attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. However, the usefulness of association rules is strongly limited by the huge amount of delivered rules. It is crucial to help the decisionmaker with an efficient postprocessing step in order to select interesting association rules throughout huge volumes of discovered rules. This motivates the need for association analysis. This paper presents a survey of different association rule mining techniques for market basket analysis highlighting strengths of different association rule mining techniques.  Further, we want to point out potential pitfalls as well as challenging issues need to be addressed by an association rule mining technique. We believe that the results of this evaluation will help decision maker for making important decisions Index Terms- CLOSET, MAFIA, FP I  INTRODU CTION Association rule mining is considered as one of the most important tasks in Knowledge Discovery in Databases. An association rule is defined as the implication X => Y described by two interestingness measures-support and confidence-where X and Y are the sets of items. Furthermore valuable information is often represented by those rare-low support and unexpected association rules which are surprising to the user. So, the more we increase the support threshold, the more efficient the algorithms are and the more the discovered rules are obvious, and hence, the less they are interesting for the user. As a result, it is necessary to bring the support threshold low enough in order to extract valuable information. Unfortunately, the lower the support is, the larger the volume of rules becomes, making it intractable for a decision-maker to analyze the mining result. Experiments show that rules become almost impossible to use when the number of rules overpasses 100. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision maker with an efficient technique for reducing the number of rules In this paper, a fairly comprehensive comparison of various association rule mining techniques is presented We analyzed the performance and the efficiency of different association mining approaches. Also this paper discusses the level of interestingness each technique provides. Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II contains a generalized summary of various association mining techniques and brief description of different approaches that have been taken for study. Section III gives a comparative analysis of various association mining techniques based on certain parameters  II  METHODOLOGY FOR ASSOCIATION RULE GENERATION Association analysis has wide range of applications in market basket analysis, Intrusion detection, bioinformatics web usage mining. There have been several such association mining techniques for generating association rules. The concise representation of frequent itemset as proposed by Burdick n d o p ti m a l r u le di s c o v er y as pr opo sed by Li 3   intr o d u c ed co nci s e r e presen t at ion o f f r e que nt  itemset to reduce the number of frequent itemsets and CLOSET algorithm was proposed new e f f i ci ent  method for mining closed itemsets. Another solution for the reduction of the number of frequent itemsets is mining maximal frequent itemsets [6 MAFIA algor i t h m is b a s e d  on depth-first traversal and several pruning methods. More recently, Bellandi r opos ed ont o l ogy d r iv e n  as soci a t i o n  rule extraction.The different approaches for the redundancy reduction of association rules are: Zaki and Hsiao used frequent closed itemsets in the CHARM algorithm [8 in  order to generate all frequent closed itemsets. They used an itemset-tid set search tree and pursued with the aim of generating a small nonredundant rule set al  the authors first found minimal generator for closed itemsets and then, they generated nonredundant association rules using two closed itemsets Pasquier et al. [1 pr o p ose d th e Cl ose a l gor it h m  in  order to extract association rules. Close algorithm is based on a new mining method: pruning of the closed set lattice closed itemset lattice\n order to extract frequent closed itemsets. Association rules are generated starting from frequent itemsets generated from frequent closed itemsets As proposed in o s ing t h e ri gh t ob j e c t ive m e as ure  is an important factor to be considered. [12 A   Si l b e r s c h atz and A. Tuzhilin proposed an approach about the interestingness pattern. From the above association rule mining techniques, few are selectively analyzed in detail in this literature  A  CLOSET: an Efficient Algorithm for mining Frequent closed Itemsets This approach is an efficient algorithm for mining frequent itemsets with the development of three techniques i\ Applying compressed, frequent pattern tree FP-tree structure for mining closed itemsets without candidate generation  ii\ Developing a single prefix path compression technique to identify frequent closed itemsets quickly iii\xploring a partition based project ion mechanism for scalable mining in large databases 409 ___________________________________ 978-14244 8679-3  11 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE 


              Opt imization1: Compress transactional and conditional databases using an FP-tree structure  Optimization2: Extract items appearing in every transaction of conditional database   Fig 1. Directly Extract frequent closed itemsets from FP tree Fi g 1. shows how the frequent closed itemsets can be extracted directly from FP tree. This reduces the size of FPtree because the conditional databases contain less number of items after extraction and also reduces the level of recursion  Optimization3: Directly extract frequent itemsets from FP-tree   This allows the program to identify frequent closed itemsets quickly   Reduces the size of remaining FP tree to be examined   Reduces the level of recursion Optimization4: Prune search branches   B  Ontology-Driven Association Rule Extraction This provides an integrated framework for extracting constraint-based Multi-level Association Rules with an ontology support. This method can improve the quality of filtered rules The System Architecture as shown in Fig.2 presents a view of set of components in the Ontology-Driven rule extraction. The ontology \(OD\describes the domain of interest \(D\ and it is used as a means of meta-data representation. The interpretation module translates the requests of a user \(user constraints\ into a set of formal constrains \(QD defined on OD\so that they can be supplied to the Ontology Query Engine by means of a suitable query language  Fig 2. System Architecture  There are several ways to reduce the computational complexity of Association Rule Mining and to increase the quality of the extracted rules: \(i\ reducing the search space ii\ exploiting efficient data structures; \(iii\ adopting domain-specific constraints. The first two classes of optimizations are used for reducing the number of steps of the algorithm, for re-organizing the itemsets, for encoding the items, and for organizing the transactions in order to minimize the algorithm time complexity. The third class tries to overcome the lack of user data-exploration by handling domain-specific constraints This paper focuses on these optimizations by representing a specific domain by means of ontology and driving the extraction of association rules by expressing constraints. The aim of this work is to reduce the “search space” of the algorithm and to improve the significance of the association rules  C  Selecting the Right Objective Measure for Association Analysis This approach describe several key properties one should examine in order to select the right measure for a given application. An algorithm is presented for selecting a small set of patterns such that domain experts can find a measure that best fits their requirements by ranking this small set of patterns. This approach describe several key properties one should examine in order to select the right measure for a given application  The specific contributions are 1\overview of 21 objective measures is discussed in the statistics, social science, machine learning, and data mining literature. It is shown that application of different measures may lead to substantially differing orderings of patterns 2\eral key properties are proposed that will help analysts to select the right measure for a given application A comparative study of these properties is made using the twenty-one existing measures. Our results suggest that we can identify several groups of consistent measures having similar properties 3\This also illustrates two situations in which most of the measures become consistent with each other, namely, when support-based pruning and a technique known as table standardization are used. This method also demonstrates the 410 


        utility of support-based pruning in terms of eliminating uncorrelated and poorly correlated patterns 4\ An algorithm is used for selecting a small set of tables such that domain experts can determine the most suitable measure by looking at their rankings for this small set of tables D  An Approach to Facilitate the Analysis of the Association Rules The goal of the research presented in this paper is to enable the end users to analyze, understand and use the extracted knowledge in an intelligent system or to support in the decision-making processes... In the paper, the GART algorithm is proposed, which uses taxonomies to generalize association rules, and the RulEE-GAR computational module, that enables the analysis of the generalized rules This method uses iterative taxonomy to generalize and then prunes redundant rules at each step During years, manual methods had been used to convert data in knowledge. However the use of these methods has become expensive, time consuming, subjective and nonviable when applied at large databases. The problems with the manual methods stimulated the development of processes of automatic analysis, like the process of Knowledge Discovery in Databases or Data Mining In the Data Mining process, the use of the association rules technique may generate large quantities of patterns which make it difficult for the analyst to analyze the resultant pattern. A way to solve the problem of the large quantities of patterns extracted by the association rules technique is the use of taxonomies in the step of postprocessing Knowledge. The taxonomies may be used to prune uninteresting and/or redundant rules. In this paper the GART algorithm and the RulEE-GAR computational module is proposed. The GART algorithm \(Generalization of Association Rules using Taxonomies\ uses taxonomies to generalize association rules. The RulEEGAR computational module uses the GART algorithm, to generalize association rules, and provides several means to analyze the generalized rules. The RulEE-GAR computational module that provides means to generalize association rules and also to analyze the generalized rules. The screen of the interface enables the user to analyze and to explore the generalized rules sets E  An Efficient and Interactive Postmining of Association Rules In Data Mining, the usefulness of association rules is strongly limited by the huge amount of delivered rules. To overcome this drawback, several methods were proposed in the literature such as itemset concise representations redundancy reduction, and postprocessing. However, being generally based on statistical information, most of these methods do not guarantee that the extracted rules are interesting for the user. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision-maker with an efficient postprocessing step in order to reduce the number of rules This paper proposes a new interactive approach to prune and filter discovered rules. First, ontologies are proposed in order to improve the integration of user knowledge in the postprocessing task. Secondly, Rule Schema formalism specification is used for user expectations. Furthermore, an interactive framework is designed to assist the user throughout the analyzing task as shown in Fig.3 As the approach proposed in m e t h o d c o n tain s  two main parts. First, the knowledge base allows formalizing user knowledge and goals. Domain knowledge offers a general view over user knowledge in database domain, and user expectations express the prior user knowledge over the discovered rules. Second, the postprocessing task consists in applying iteratively a set of filters over extracted rules in order to extract interesting rules: minimum improvement constraint filter, item-relatedness filter, rule schema filters/pruning    Fig.3. Fra mework Description  III  A NALYSIS OF ASSOCIATION RULE MININGTECHNIQUE  Parameters used for Comparison The main parameters we considered for the analysis of different association rule mining approaches are scalability quality of filtered rules, user interesting criteria Efficiency and Scalability have always been important concerns in the field of data mining, and are even more so in the multi-relational context, which is inherently more complex. The issue has been receiving an increasing amount of attention during the last few years, and quite a number of theoretical results, algorithms and implementations have been presented that explicitly aim at improving the efficiency and Scalability of multi-relational data mining approaches. Table1 shows the comparison of different association rule mining approaches Scalability The system should be scalable with increase in amount of information User Interestingness Criteria This depends on strong interaction with the user The comparison of different association rule mining approach is given in Table 1.

Objective measure is restricted only for data evaluation not sufficient to reduce number of rules and to capture interesting one  H  An Efficient and Interactive Post mining of Association Rules \(Proposed Approach The proposed approach is composed of two main phases The first phase includes the generation of support counts of item sets at each timeslot and candidate item sets. The second phase involves mining of association rules from candidate items and post mining of association rules using ontology and user constraint template to guarantee user interesting rules as shown in Fig 4  Fig 4.

Among available algorithms, We use the Apriori algorithm in order to extract association rules. The generated association rules describe the relationship between attribute Steps of frequent item set and association rule generation 1  Scan the database to calculate the support of each item set 2  Add the item set to frequent item set if support is greater than or equal to min_support 3  At each level divide each of the frequent items set into left hand side and right hand side 4  Calculate the confidence of each rule that is generated  412

Further the potential pitfalls as well as challenging issues need to be addressed by an association rule mining technique are also discussed. We believe that the results of this evaluation will help decision maker for making important decisions. We have evaluated the algorithms based on parameters like scalability, quality of filtered rules. Our evaluation shows that interactive postmining process should be efficient and produce user interesting rules  ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank ALMIGHTY GOD whose blessings have bestowed in me the will power and confidence to carry out my work    REFERENCES  1 Clau dia Marinica and Fabrice Guillet, “Knowledge-Based   Interactive Postmining of Association Rules Using Ontologies IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data    Engineering, Vol. 22, No. 6 June 2010   B u r d ick M C a li m l i m  J.

Members endowments Familys endowments Attitude of families to IT Attitude of neighbours to IT Adoption attention Fig.1.Information technology adoption model based on farmers endowments From the results above, age, education, family income family communication cost and job type affect farmers capacity of information technology adoption. Moreover perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude of neighbors to techniques affect farmers intention. Therefore the data mining of association rules behind will use these 9 factors to study farmers endowments impact on information technology adoption behavior and their adoption mode C. Mode of farmers information technology adoption based on association rules 1 Association rules are to look for the relationship among different variables in the database, and find out the frequent mode [11 Definition 1: Let   be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let transaction T be a subset of I i.e. I?T . Let  be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID. Let A be an itemset, and transaction T contains A, i.e. TA Definition 2: A rule is defined as an implication of the form BA? ?where IA ? , IB ? ,and ??BA ? . The sets of items A and B are called antecedent \(left-hand-side or LHS and consequent \(right-hand-side or RHS respectively Definition 3 : When BA?  is a rule in database D, it has to satisfy the minimum support S and minimum confidence C Support is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contains the itemset, i.e BAPS Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability  ABP Association rules generation is usually split up into two 


separate steps Step 1: minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database Step 2: these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules 2 In 1994, Agrawal with other scholars worked out Apriori algorithm. The core principle is that the subsets of a frequent itemset are still frequent itemsets and the supersets of an unfrequent itemset are still unfrequent. Moreover, Apriori is a kind of iterative algorithm which is based on a two-stage mining thought for frequent itemsets. In detail, Apriori uses a bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time \(a step known as candidate generation groups of candidates are tested against the data. From L1 to Lk the algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. But one attention of Apriori is that when searching for frequent subset Lk from Lk-1, connection and pruning will be done in the process. And finally association rules will result from the frequent itemsets[12 3 With software Weka3.5.8, some association rules between three information techniques \(call centre, SMS and network platform under the condition of probability=0.5, confidence=0.4 Therefore, some strong association rules with high confidence have been listed typically in Table.2 TABLE II.

SMS = yes a technique while job=farmer, family communication channels middle, family communication cost = middle and family income =middle. The association rules reflect weak relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation. However farmers are still afraid of getting fake information b technique while age = young, job = planting, breeding and selling production, family income = high and public communication channels = wide. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers job, age and family income. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, this technique costs much c 


while age=young, education=high, family communication cost=middle and family income=high. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, farmers are still worried about the attitude of neighbors around to their behavior 4.CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION From the mining results, we bring forward following conclusions A. Build various communication channels and provide differentiation information technology Farmers who have few communication channels dont want to adopt new techniques because of their limited family economic ability. We suggest government should try to reduce the risk and cost of technique adoption, promote various communication channels with different charging standards or provide some benefits of different degrees B.  Intensify farmers education and improve farmers certification of techniques Government should undertake some temporary training courses to instruct farmers some new information technologies for rural areas and let farmers be acquaint with these techniques. In this way, first farmers certification and then the information technology adoption rate will be improved C. Reduce technique cost and improve service quality It will do well in the technique promotion when the technique charging is lower and techniques are more various Moreover, considering that the service quality will influence farmers technology adoption intention and behavior information service institutions should try to perfect the quality through better satisfying farmers information demands and more reducing service cost. In this way, farmers information technology adoption will be promoted ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper is sponsored by Beijing forestry university Scientific and Technological Innovation Project BLRW200922 REFERENCES 1] Artesyn technologies: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Phone Covered 99.8% of Administrative Villages While Broadband Covered 96% of Villages and Towns. 3      December  2009. 20 June

Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
