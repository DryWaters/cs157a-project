  An Improved Multi-Support Apriori Algorithm Under the Fuzzy Item Association Condition Hangbin LI, Shuhua CHEN, Jianchen LI, Shuo WANG, Yihang FU School of Computer Wuhan University Wuhan, China 430072 lihangbin@whu.edu.cn \(Hangbin LI  Abst ract Apriori Algorithm has been successfully used in the mining of association rules. The algorithm with multiple-support is proposed for solving “rare item” problem, which means the common items and rare items cannot be satisfied within single support. However, the detailed identification of items will cause the poor mining rules, wh ile the multi-level approach distinguishes the fuzzy associ ation between items in real condition. This paper proposed a novel model based on tags to 
solve the problem. Each item ha s various tags, which implies the common attributes. This model is adaptive to the reality since certain item set can be accurately derived from whole sets using combination of tags by users as they like. A corresponding improved multi-support Apriori algo rithm is also presented for a recommendation system. The exp erimental results demonstrated that the new model and the approach are more effective and adaptive Keywords-Aprioiri algorithm, tag personalized service, multiple support I   I NTR ODUCTION  Dat a mining, which is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Database, is the process of finding useful or potentially valuable patterns and knowledge. Association rule is important 
law within the data source, thus widely applied in the field of data mining Association rule mining aims at finding all concurrent associations in data items satisfying condition. During this process, support and confiden ce are two crucial values to weigh the relationship strength. Mining can be divided into two steps I Generate frequent item sets II Generate association rules Apriori algorithm proposed by Agrawal and Strikantm [1   FP growth algorithm proposed by Han and other auth are classical algorithms in this field. In Apriori algorithm, when considering rare items and combination explosion, Bing Liu proposed MS-Apriori algorithm When given an item set, a minimum support and a 
minimum confidence, the result of mining association rules is uniquely determined. Thus, beside the result, we care more about the efficiency of mining. The two major factors concerning the efficien cy lie as follows 1. The information, or data set are in large scale, usually generating a huge number of frequent item sets, and many of those sets appears to be similar or useless. Liu and other authors proposed classified association rules [5 and Li n and  Kedem proposed maximum frequent item set to solve the problem  2. Only part of the generated association rules turned out meaningful in the sense of human condition. It can be measured in interestingness The data set in real condition can be enormous, so as the 
connection between things. To divide things into parts is a crucial step to process data, but hierarchy division cannot represent the inner connection between things accurately However, tag—as a property similar to keyword, can represent the common character of different things in different field individually. This article proposed a model based on tags. In this model, items are categorized with multiple tags. Users can apply tags according to their own needs. Concerning different kind of items, the tags can vary in scale and intensity flexibly Meanwhile, we adopt interestingness into MS-Apriori algorithm to guide the generation of association rules. The associations with least interestingness in the sequence are 
excluded through the pruning process, which would give the result more accuracy II  R EVI EW OF THE CLASSIC ALGORITHM  A  Bas ic Concepts Supposing as an item set is the combination of transaction. Every element is an item set, satisfying 
a ssociation ruleis an implicated formula as follows where  X is antecedent, while Y is consequent The support count of X in T X.count\resents the number of item X in transaction T  Support: the support of rule means the percentage of transactions in T which contains also knownas the 
probability estimation of      T count means the number of transaction in transaction set T Confidence: the confidence of rule means the percentage of transactions whic h have both item X and item Y 3539 978-1-4577-0321-8/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 


  i n the transactions which have item X, also known as the estimation of conditional probability       T he support of rules represen ts the frequency of rule’s usage in transaction, while the confidence determines the predictability of the rule. The aim of association rules mining is to find association rules which satisfy the specified minimum support and minimum confidence in transaction set B  Apriori Algorithm Apriori algorithm generates frequent item set efficiently based on closed down property. If an item set satisfies a certain minimum support and minimum confidence, any one non-empty subset of the item sets must satisfy this minimum support and minimum confidence This whole algorithm is based on the idea of searching level by level Firstly, scan the item sets to find 1-item set, meanwhile count the number of different item set. Secondly, find F 1  w hich satisfies the minimum support and minimum confidence, then use F 1 t o generate 2-item sets. During the process, combination and pruning should be carried out in order to further reduce the cost of time and space. Scan the item sets to count 2-item set to find those F 2 which satisfy the minimum support and minimum confidence. The process repeats until the F n   Finally the result of F 1 F 2  F n  w ill be returned. Since the data set is read into the memory through a series of blocks, there would be no problem if massive data occurs C  Association Rules Mining with Mutiple Support In classical Apriori algorithm, there is only one threshold value, which implies that all items in data sets have the same property. It is far from the condition in real life. If we set a relatively low threshold value for rare item in the data set however it will lead to the combination explosion problem. So it is obvious that only one threshold value of minimum support is not good enough. A corresponding solution is that for every element of  we give a minimum support MIS\(i\, and further define    a s the minimum support of a transaction. By using this method different rules can have its own minimum support III  M ODE L WITH TAG CLASSIFICATION AND THE I M PROVED A LG ORITHM  A  Book recommendation model based on tag classification In a recommendation system based association rules, the elements of transaction set are concrete objects, rather than general concept defining a class of things, such as milk or bread. In this case, strong association rules would be dispersed and has a relatively small support. On the other hand, people would sometimes care for the connection between different categories of things. A famous example was that the connection between beers and diapers. However, such connection would not be specific to the level of brand or scale of object. If taking all the condition mentioned above into consideration, both quality and efficiency of current algorithm has room for improvement This problem can be overcome by classifying products according to level classifications. And the recommendations to be performed utilize the association rules of classifications of products. Researchers in this area have made attempts and progress. In some of these methods, things are classified in tree structure The advantage of such classifi cation is that, to generate association rules for higher levels of things, we can simply shift the scale up and down. For example, a certain coke can be classified as follows Drink – Soft drink - Coca-Cola – 355ml canned If we want to study the association between soft drink and some other things, we can locate the level “soft drink” in the tree structure uniquely. Therefore, the larger the support is, the association rules people find would be more valuable However, the mining through multi-level approach also has obvious limitations. In real life, the things are hard to be divided level by level, but rather easy to describe in network shape. A certain novel can be described as science fiction thrilling, classical and American Literature at the same time. It would be hard to judge whether the American Literature or the science fiction would be the parent category. Hardly any appropriate sequence of categories can be given out when we are dealing with cross-associations To deal with those complicated situations, we proposed a model based on tags. A tag is a non-hierarchical keyword or term belongs to a certain block of information. It helps describe an item and also allows it to be easily found Generally tags are chosen by the creator or by its viewer of the item. By using tags, we can form connections between related items. A certain item assigned to a book can be described as follows Book title  tag s scien ce fictio n  th rillin g, cl a s sica l   American Literature With this kind of description, we can easily associate this novel with other books related other science fiction belongs to a different nation, or books equally thrilling beyond the science fiction. In the other example mentioned above, by group two tags of canned and drink, we can create a new set In conclusion, tags can represent complicated connection between items. The process is as follows         Fig ure 1 T he author of this article has developed a book recommendation system based on tag model. It uses tagged multi-support Apriori algorithm \(T-MSApriori\ mine data generate association rules, and provide services concerning recommendations.

  b eing self-generated. Meanwhile, the values of multi-support can be manually set, in order to deal with th e unbalance with frequently appeared products an d rarely appeared products B  The description of the improved algorithm We improve the algorithm of generating association rules and propose a multi-support al gorithm based on tag model Tagged Multi-Support Apriori Algorithm \(T-MSApriori Step1: Add tags to items, and items with same tags are equivalent class Step2: Adjust confidence and provide each type of item with a minimum support; sort the items by minimum support Step3: Use modified transaction set to generate frequent item set Step4: Generate association rules based on frequent item set and interest measure from tags  Usage:  Classify items by tags I nput: Transaction database T, list of tags of same type TG Output: Modified transaction database T A lgorithm classifyTansaction\(T,TG Begin for each transaction t T do for each tg TG do for each item t do if item.tag tg  t  t-{item t t  tg.item endif endfor endfor endfor return T End   U sage F requent Item Generating Input: Transaction database T, Book Set I, Minimum Support of Each Item S, Minimum Confidence, Total Transaction Amount n, list of tags of same type TG Output: Association Rules R\(Including Frequent Item Set F A lgorithm TMS-Apriori\(T,MS TG Begin T classifyTansaction\(T,TG M sort\(I,MS L init-pass\(M,T F 1   l  l L l.count/n MIS\(l  for\(k = 2; Fk k do C k candidate-gen\(F k-1  f or each transaction t T do  for each candidate c C k do i f\(c t c.count save for the generating rules  if\(c-{c[1  t c-{c[1  c ou nt   endfor e ndfor  F k  c  c C k  c.count/n MIS\(c[1     endfor return F k F k  E nd   It is worthy concerning that some generated rules are not meaningful in practical use. Herewe introduce the lift to justify the reasonable rules For A B,   lift B A B For the rule with lift equaling 1, the recommendation has no practical value. Only when lift is bigger than 1 are the rules lifted. The quality of generated rules can be regulated by modifying the threshold of lift  IV  A LG ORITHM A P PLICATION AND A NAL YSIS  T he novel model with tags and the corresponding algorithm can be used in both commercial and academic fields such as recommendation systems. Here we provide examples for illustration A  Simulation Application The test item is as follows: \(minConf = 0.6 Item Name Minimum Support Tag A 0 5 a b c B 0.5 a b f C 0 5 a c e D 0 3 b d E 0 3 b c f T he transaction list: ACD, CD, ABCDE, C, CD The users can set a different minimum support value for each item, which facilitates dealing with rare items. Besides, it is also allowed to divide the item set into several categories combine detailed items into category in another view Ex1 Item Union: ab Let G = {A,B} \(A,B share tag of ab\MIS\(G Generated Frequent Item Set: GC, CE, GCE, DE \(1-frequent item is discarded Generated Association Rules an tecedent confidence lift D C 100% 1 C D 80% 1 G D 100% 1 25 DG C 100% 1  F rom above we can see that only the third rule is a positive one Ex2 Item Union: ac; bf Let H = {A,C} I = {B,E}, MIS\(H\ = 0.5, MIS\(I\0.3 Generated Frequent Item Set: HD antecedent confidence lift H 80% 1 D 100% 1 From the test above, we can see users are allowed to set the different factors by the presented integrated items. The generated rules, which are variable with the factors, adjust to the certain purpose. Users can focus on the interested concepts 3541 


  w hich they can extract by themselves in the fuzzy inner relationship of items and concentrate on the related ones. The lift tells whether this rule is meaningful and it is easier to achieve the similarity of items in rules by the common tags So this model is user-friendly and meets various needs of customers B  Association Rules Test A comparison between the traditional algorithm and the improved one based on tag model is conducted as follows Figure 2 show that the improved algorithm \(TMS-Apriori generated less association rules than the traditional algorithm with the same threshold. This is because some items are merged into certain categories Since avoiding overwhelmed but poor rules, lower number of frequent item set represent a more accuracy results, in other words, with a higher quality when generating rules  Fig ure 2: Performance of the improved Apriori algorithm V  C ONC LUSION  In this paper, we have proposed an improved model and approach to extract th e association rules. In the real condition the recommendation system f aces the complex and fuzzy relationship among items. Besides, it is wise to hold the personalized service. We build up the novel model using tags and show the corresponding improved algorithm. The various kinds of category-dividing measures are supported. Moreover each item has a different support value, which is suitable for mining rare items. As a result, the proposed algorithm and the recommendation system are user-friendly and can efficiently reduce poor-quality rules. We have simulate the application and test the performance of the proposed approach by conducting experimental results on both synthetic and the practical datasets to prove the effort For future research, the mining of association rules can be dynamic and the mining engine is auto-adaptive to the change of dataset. The dynamic personalized service also requires highly efficient approaches R EF ERENCES   1  R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, A.

TherifOre, the obtained normal data is updated dynamically, can timely ntlect the latest circs rather than limited to historical data 2 generate data records with a specific format 3 using an improved association rules algorithm in this paper to mine the normal or abnormal rules existed between d!lforent projects to generate decision rules and send to the rule base for storage 4 rules generatedfrom the current network data stream with the judgment rules in the rule base, calculate with the similarity, and then judge the results This system is a circularly and dynamically updated system, but it must first create a set of legitimate access rules from a static database as the basis for the system's judgment After entering the dynamic intrusion detection management process, the normal data may be extracted from the historical network data stream through the intrusion detection, or the additional data judged to be legitimate, which strictly removes all the possible invasion data, so the rules extracted from the normal data are normal rules, of course, the better the more training data, thus the extracted rules are more complete [6] . When the historical records have not a major change, the auditing of them can be suspended, but only the additional data should be processed, which is also an another improvement of this system to save system resources B.

33%, confidence is 90%. However, the rules relevant to excel by using Apriori algorithm can not be found at the same thresholds And then, add score of single choice, the total score of student and the college as horizontal weighted items to transaction database, furthermore, 0.5, 1.2 and 1 have been assigned to the items in sequence. Other items' weights are the same as above setting. Score of single choice has been divided into three sections in the same way, and a certain notation has been assigned to each part. Also total score has been treated in the same way. In sequence, use notation A, B and C instead of scores in excellent, average and weak sections for single-choice questions, X, Y and Z for total score. With Wminsup=20% and Wminconf=30%, the following valuable rules have been discovered in the database 9 ? CCW sup = 27%, Wcan! = 38 9 ? L\(W sup = 27%, Wean! = 39 9 ? O\( W sup = 27%, Wean! = 69 9 ?

C\(W sup = 78%, Wean! = 100 Analyzing of the first four rules can discover that students from college of File art get the worst score in optional questions. Only if teachers strengthen the teaching of this chapter can improve average of the college, thereby improving average of the university. From later two rules we can find that grades of excel, optional and single choice have closer relationship with total score than other scores of questions. But if apply Apriori to mining rules in the transaction database and only if minimum support is decreased to 5%, rules relation with colleges can be obtained Moreover, the last rule with 48% support and 95 confidence can be obtained by using Apriori. Obviously using mixed weighted association rules algorithm improves the support and confidence of rules, and makes them be discovered easier VII. CONCLUSION This paper takes college computer cultural foundation course grade database as example, applies mixed weighted 


association rules algorithm to obtain some importance and valuable information according to characteristic of the database, such as the correlations of chapters, and the factors influence total score of students. The information has reference value for teaching, and is helpful to improve learning efficiency of students. Ultimately, the average scores of the students are improved. Similarly, the approach of analysis in scores of computer foundation course database can also be applied in other college examination course grade database, such like college English test grades database, principles of Marxist philosophy test scores database and so on. In addition, application in other database like national computer rank test, CET-4, a lot of valuable information can be discovered. This important information as reference for the teaching reform is beneficial to improve quality of teaching REFERENCES I] R. Agrawal and R.

Observe how the vertical lines are consistent with the 2D map Fig. 8. Environment with 3D lines VI. DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES This paper describes an original composite sensor approach that takes advantage of the information given by an omnidirectional camera and a laser range finder to ef 


ficiently solve the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem for indoor environments, and to reconstruct a 3D representation of the environment. The accompanying video illustrates the incremental generation of a 2D map and the estimation of the robot trajectory alongside the laser range data projected on omnidirectional images. It also shows the vertical lines detected in the images and their mapping into a 3D reconstruction of the environment In order to show the robustness of the methodology, we tested the algorithm with a sequence taken in a different indoor environment with our old robot Anis which is equipped with the same catadioptric camera and an AccuRange 4000 2D laser range finder. This laser is composed of a laser telemeter with a rotating mirror that allows measurements of points on 360?, except for an occlusion cone of approximately 30? caused by the assembly of the mirror. The resulting 2D map is shown in Figure 9. The vertical line extraction and the reconstruction of the 3D environment were 3523 Fig. 9. Global Map obtained by SLAM in Borel Building consistent as well The SLAM problem has been solved using many different approaches, however some important problems need to be addressed that are often directly linked to the sensors used Laser range finders cannot help in evaluating the translation of a robot moving in a straight line in a corridor. Mapping in dynamic environments is also hard with only laser data. On the other hand, using visual sensors alone introduces issues such as propagating correctly the scale factor, initializing the range when using a monocular sensor, and merging data when using multiples cameras In our approach, the laser provides metric information of the environment that helps to fix a scale factor \(removing the difficulty of propagating the scale factor need to use multiple cameras. Throughout the paper we have identified several advantages of combining laser and visual sensors. Our experimental results are encouraging and give us valuable insight into the possibilities offered by this composite sensor approach We have considered several research directions that could be pursued to improve the results obtained so far. We have thought about extending our algorithm with loop closure de 


tection. This would allow the algorithm to detect previously visited locations and improve the accuracy of mapping and the precision in the estimation of the robot pose. Being able to detect previously visited places is of great importance to solve the problem of global localization and to recover the robot from kidnapping, a situation occurring when the robot is displaced by something out of its control \(e.g. taking an elevator, being transported from one location to another Therefore, solving the loop closure problem will not only improve SLAM performance, but will as well enable new capabilities Further work will concentrate on an extension of the PSM algorithm to exploit the information about vertical lines detected using omnidirectional images.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
