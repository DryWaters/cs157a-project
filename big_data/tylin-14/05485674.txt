The Intrusion Detection System Based on Fuzzy Association Rules Mining Ma yanchun North China Institute of science and Technology Yanjiao Beijing-East, China e-mail: 11624642@qq.com Abstract In this paper, we integrate fuzzy association rules to design and implement an abnormal network intrusion detection system. Since the association rules used in traditional information detection cannot effectively deal with changes in network behavior, it will better meet the actual needs of abnormal detection to introduce the concept of fuzzy association rules to strengthen the adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on the study of Denial of Service \(DOS According to the experimental results, it is found that our system can correctly identify all DOS attacks on test after appropriate adjustment of system parameters. Moreover, it also proves, in the experiment, that our system would not result in false positives under such circumstances as a large amount of instantaneous FTP normal packet flow.  In addition if source of an attacker can be determined, the system will also be able to promptly inform the firewall to alter its rules and cut off the connection Keywords  network security; fuzzy theory; association Rules; fuzzy association rules; denial-of-service attack I. INTRODUCTION Network Intrusion Detection System is commonly classified into host-based intrusion detection system \(HIDS 1] and network intrusion detection system \(NIDS  course, there are some intrusion detection systems which are a combination of both, generally referred to as hybrid intrusion detection System \(HIDS individual host while NIDS protects the whole network And both of them have their advantages and disadvantages In this paper, fuzzy association rules are introduced to design a real-time network intrusion detection system Different from [3], it takes a long time to collect packets of information before making off-line analysis. However, [3 has its disadvantages. On one hand, the system does not meet the needs of real-time detection and real-time processing, which are required in an invasion system. On the other hand, short-term attack is likely to be diluted during a long-period flow of packet information and cannot 


be detected since it is unable to meet the minimum support In addition, because different types of attacks usually require specific detection methods to achieve excellent results, the text also differs from [3] in the selection of signature and the application of fuzzy function. In this paper, denial-of-service attack serves as an experimental subject II. DOS AND DDOS The so-called DoS\(Denial of Service attack that utilizes limited network resources \(such as Memory, Processor and Bandwidth, etc loopholes in the design and application of partial network system software, or other related communication protocol to make the attacked websites unable to process requests through substantial and intensive packet transmission. In this way, many users who try to get normal access to those websites will be rejected; or the attempt to identify loopholes the program has failed to handle will crash the system so that it will be out of service. DDoS \(Distributed Denial of Service of service attacks but there are more triggered attackers III. THE ALGORITHM OF FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES We will give an introduction of how to compute the similar degree among association rules, fuzzy association rules and rules, which are basic knowledge related to this paper. Then, specific examples will be given to explain how to apply the knowledge to the design of network intrusion detection system A. The Algorithm of Association Rules Association rules [4] are defined as follows: suppose 321 miiiiI = is the set of all items, database D the set of all transaction record T and T a subset of any item from I. A set X  I is called itemset, the number of items which contained is regarded as the length of it. If its length is k, then it is claimed as k-itemset. If a transaction record supports an itemset X, it must contain all items of X, X  T written as support\(X The representation form of association rules is X  Y,X Y  I and X ? Y = . Association rules depend on two parameters \(support and confidence are meaningful or not. Support refers to the percentage of X Y transaction records in database, written as support \(X 


Y association rules, that is, the chances that Y will appear when condition X occurs, written as support \(X  Y X confidence must be equal to or higher than the threshold level set by the user, which is also the minimum support and confidence. In general, the widely used algorithm in association rules is Apriroi algorithm [4]. Apriori algorithm for mining association rules is divided into two parts V7-667978-1-4244-6349-7/10/$26.00 c2010 IEEE a b Figure 1. Adopting the Difference between Discrete Split and Fuzzy Logic Phase1: search database and find out frequent itemset or large itemset Phase2: use frequent itemset or large itemset to extract all association rules, whose confidence is lower than the minimum B. The Algorithm of Fuzzy Association Rules Support \(X and is calculated according to its record counts in database D. When used in intrusion detection, each item will appear in every record, and have a quantization value. Their difference between them can be learned from record description by checking database D. Suppose I = \(A, B, C, D, E are five records in database D.\(a in traditional Data Mining and \(b Intrusion Detection. The first record in \(b indicates statistical network traffic in certain unit time. And there are 25 packets with signature A, 53 with signature B, 9 with signature C, 21 with signature D and 12 with signature E. The network information flow in next unit time will be described by the second record, and so on. Unit time can be determined by network traffic but we must take into account the processing time to ensure the instantaneity. However, the traditional Apriori algorithm doesnt apply to quantitative database. In the field of data detection, many solutions on the problem of item quantification have been proposed. In this paper, fuzzy Logic is adopted to mine such quantitative database and the association rules mined is called Fuzzy Association Rules 


For quantitative data, one of the most straightforward ways is to grade value for each item clearly. In item A, we set value below 20 is Low, value between 21 ~ 60 Medium value above 61 High; In item B, we set value below 100 Low, value between 101 ~ 300 Medium, value above 301 High, and so is with C, D, E. The database in \(b and tableI is described as follows A=Medium, B=Low, C=x, D=x, E=x A=Low, B=Low, C=x, D=x, E=x A=Low, B=High, C=x, D=x, E=x A=High, B=Low, C=x, D=x, E=x A=Medium, B=Medium, C=x, D=x, E=x TABLE I. FOR DATA MINING Record 1 A,B,D 2 B,C,E 3 A,C 4 D,E 5 B,D,E TABLE II. FOR NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION Record 1 A=25,B=53,C=9,D=21,E=12 2 A=1,B=35,C=7,D=31,E=7 3 A=6,B=345,C=91,D=41,E=32 4 A=61,B=85,C=15,D=22,E=33 5 A=31,B=277,C=34,D=81 With x  \(Low, Medium, High algorithm is more applicable, but there is a Sharp Boundary Problem in such a clear manner of grading. In \(a for example, the occurrence counts of A = Medium can only be calculated by accumulating records in the database, such as A = 21, A = 22, ..., A = 60. Although there are a great deal of such records as A = 18, 19 or 61, 62, they contribute little to the counts of A = Medium. Obviously, it is possible that the association rules mined though this method will fail to describe the real situation. Let suppose the interval of A Medium extends to 19 on the left or 61 on the right, then the association rules mined may be completely different To solve Sharp Boundary Problem, the concept of Fuzzy Logic is introduced in [6]. In accordance with Fuzzy Logic each item is renamed Fuzzy Variable and each category Fuzzy Sets, such as Low, Medium and High. The difference 


lies in the fact that Fuzzy Sets \(Low, Medium and High no longer clearly graded, but individually described by a continuous function, which is called Membership Function such as \(b A, B C, D, E usually must be accompanied by y being part of weighted values\(grade b there is one record A = 20, B = ..., which belongs to A Low \(0.5 0.95 0 in parentheses is 20 and that is the weighted value when respectively incorporated into Membership Function \(A Low, A. Medium and A. High  Certainty are introduced to replace the degree of support and confidence in traditional Apriori algorithm Here we regard <F,S> as an itemset, where F is the sequence of signature\(or item Fuzzy Set, if  the ith signature  and Membership Function in the itemset\( li ??1 , l  is the length of itemset V7-668 2010 2nd International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology [Volume 7 Low, then F = \(A, B, C Low, High, Low 32,1 ,, fff represents A, B, C and  Low   with a length of l   may be represented by ??

As long as cesignificaniSig SF _min. ??? , it is a large-item When all large-item of different lengths are found out, Fuzzy Association Rules will be generated, with all Certainty mini-certainty. The calculation of Certainty can be defined like this: suppose <F, S> is the large-item that produces Fuzzy Association Rules, and it is the presupposed itemset of such rules\(conditional narration Association Rules can be defined as follows         SF SF SFSF Sig Sig Cer  2 l is the length of <F, S> and k is the length of <F , S The Certainty of each rule can be calculated by ?? SFSig SFSig All the rules with certainty ? mini-certainty will be kept and the rest removed C. Computation of Similar Degree Lets first introduce the computation of similar degree between two fuzzy association rules and later between two sets of fuzzy association rules. Suppose r1 and r2 are two fuzzy association rules, s1 and c1 represent Significance and Certainty of r1, and s2 and c2 represent Significance and Certainty of r2. Then the similar degree between s r1 and r2 is calculated as 3 The so-called r1=r2 indicates that it is the same between antecedent and consequent of two conditional narrations. In other words, different rules cant be compared and their similar degree is zero; only similar degree of the same rules 


can be computed by the above formula. As to two sets of fuzzy association rules, suppose their similar degree are s0 and s1 respectively, the computation for will be like 1||0 S Score S ScoreSSSimilarity Where     11 00   Sr Sr rrsimScore Si| represents the number of rules, i=0,1      \( 4 IV. SYSTEM  FLOW Although [3] are based on fuzzy association rules to study intrusion detection, they do not apply this method to real-time detection system. In other words, it takes them a long time to collect packet information before making offline analysis of whether such packet flow is abnormal or not However, it is unable to make instantaneous response though this method. Whats worse, if the attack time is very short the number with attacking signature will fail to reach minimum support and be ignored in such long-time packet flow. In addition, it doesnt mention in [3] how signature is produced. Through carrying out 150 automatically collected Dos attacks, checking possible signatures and sorting them according to the value of Information Gain, signatures in this paper refer to the first twelve ones with high Gain value under the premise of considering a system with instantaneous ability. Last, based on identifying the source address and fixing communication port, this system can dynamically alter the filtering rules of the firewall \(Linux' s iptable Since this system regards fuzzy association rules detected by packet flow information as its basis for judgment and packet flow may affect setup of certain parameters, it is 


suggested that the simulating tests and the actual tests should be in the same position of the whole network topology to receive better detection results. When doing simulating tests we collect packets in a specific position of network topology for three hours and make sure if there are DoS/DDoS attacks before simulating set of fuzzy association rules for comparison. The concrete steps are as follows: gathering packet traffic statistics once per unit time\(2 seconds calculating twelve required signature values and forming the first record of 5400 in total, written as 5399i0 ??ir \( i is the serial number of record we try to average the total sum of records with the same remainder when 3 is divided by the serial number and the three averaged records will better display the state of network traffic in a certain period. Last, the three records is used to figure out a set of fuzzy association rules for matching. Particularly,network traffic condition differs greatly in different period. In order to get better detection results and reduce false positive rate, fuzzy association rules for individual matching is required in the experiments aiming at different periods, such as morning, noon afternoon, evening and night In practical tests, a record is also formed by twelve signature values of packet traffic statistics gathered once per unit time \(2 seconds worked out by three accumulated records, we compute the similar degree between it and the rules produced in experimental periods. If the similar degree is lower than threshold, it is decided that there are attacks. Once attacks occur, this system cannot automatically update the firewall to block connection unless source of such attacks have been traced Network attacks vary a lot. A complete intrusion detection system is usually constituted by a number of detection modules, each of which is responsible for detecting Volume 7] 2010 2nd International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology V7-669 Figure 3   Low, Medium, and High in Membership Function certain type of attacks. On the other hand, given to considerations of instantaneity, more than one detection module will be more convenient for parallel processing. Any intelligent judgment depends upon the selection of signature but different signatures are required to effectively detect 


different types of attacks. This system mainly aims at DoS/DDoS. Based on Information Gain values, the selected 12 signatures are arrayed in descending order as follows 0. number of different payload length 1. number of different source IP address 2. number of different destination IP address 3. number of different TCP source port 4. number of different TCP destination port 5. number of different UDP source port 6. number of different UDP destination port 7. number of TCP protocol 8. number of UDP protocol 9. number of ICMP protocol 10. number of SYN flags 11. number of ACK flags Each signature has three Fuzzy Sets: Low, Medium and High. Membership Function in use is taken from Default Function of MATLAB Fuzzy Tool Box \(as follows which a, b, and c can be adjusted into constants. Fig. 3 is the instance of Membership Function. Constants of a and c in Low are 0.3 and 30; constants of a, b and c in Medium 15, 2 50; constants of a and c in High -0.3 and 80 Low f \( x 1 + exp\( a \( x - c Medium f \( x 1 + | \( x - c High f \( x 1 + exp\( -a \( x - c In experiments, we adjust the coefficient so that the signature attains more significance by making Information Gain value higher and Overlay Memory wider. However since not all signature statistics applies to the same Fuzzy Membership Function, many testing experiments are required to fine-tune each Membership Function to appropriate values and grade of individual Membership Function must be calculated in each signature. There are 12 signatures in one record and each signature have to calculate its grades in three different Membership Function. In other words, every record has 36 items, such as f0.low, f0.medium f0.high, , f11.low,f11.medium, f11.high,so it may mine numerous rules in 3 records V. THE ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The setup of system parameters differs as its operating environment changes, because we need to take into account in experiments which period is more accurate. Namely, the 


morning detection rules is best used for network intrusion detection merely in the morning as sometimes great changes takes place in network traffic condition in different periods of a day. This experiment is based on two buildings of students dormitory and performed in the night. Of the 150 collected DoS attacking software, 100 is used in experiments to search the above-mentioned 12 signatures \(higher Information Gain In order to test the detection results of this system, we have selected three types of attacking \(i.e. SYN Flood Ping of Death and Smurf set 2seconds as an unit time and perform mining \(a judgment horizontal axis of Fig.5 and Fig. 4 represents 6 seconds During the experiment, Fuzzy Association Rules is produced by a long-period accumulating of packets, averaging three records and incorporating them into algorithms of fuzzy association rules. Through long-time collecting and averaging, normal conditions can be better reflected, but it have to take us more time to identify whether these packets contain DoS attacks The bar graph value in Fig. 4indicates the similar degree between fuzzy association rules and detection rules of realtime packet information.

The detection results in b c TosserV2.1 b continuously at time points of 6, 7, 8 and 9 and it is obvious that they are different from normal network behavior. During the first d SYN Flooderv3.0 when they are attacked by SYN Flood From \(d points of 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 12 while continuous attacks are found at time points of 3 and 4 from \(e Since DoS features massive packets in a moment, we use multiple computers at the same time to download through FTP large amounts of data to verify if our system will make false positives. In Fig. 5, although it indicates clear decline after the second time intervals, there is still some way from 10%, the threshold. Finally, we execute the 50 attacking procedures thoroughly and their similar degrees are shown in 


Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, each value is the average of ten times, once each day, ten days in total. With every similar degree lower than 10%, it suggests that the twelve signatures selected by sorting Information Gain values and the selecting mode of coefficients in Membership Function can immediately detect Dos/DDoS attacks in the design of our real-time network intrusion detection system Last, we emphasize that measurement of similar degree is greatly affected by network traffic. If network packet information changes frequently, then the measured value will fluctuate in a larger section. Besides, the similar degree is also influenced by density or duration of the attacking VI. THE CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH This paper mainly contributes to the design of a real-time network intrusion detection system based on Fuzzy Association Rules. Though we take only three units of time to detect information traffic, there are 36 actual items in each record and three records can detect out many rules since 12 signatures are adopted in each record and each signature value can be incorporated into three fuzzy Membership Functions. By comparing similar degree with experimental rules, if they are lower than 0.1\(10 them as attacking events. According to experimental results it is found that our system can make correct judgment and wont cause false positives towards massive FTP packets in a moment after appropriate adjustment of system parameters In the following few days, our work should focus on improving the efficiency of detecting procedures, including cutting unit time from the present two seconds to one second; redefining the calculating mode of similar degree adjusting the coefficients of fuzzy function by Genetic Algorithm; attempting to detect based on Incremental transaction database instead of three transaction records. In the detection of incremental transaction database, we expect only one more accurate detection is performed in each unit time because both the present and the past information of the record will be detected REFERENCES 1] [1] German Florez , Susan M.Bridges , and Rayford B.

The association rules are as shown in table 5. The similarities  between the path of e-shopper CID016  and the derived rules are 22016 =SD and 11016 =SD . Therefore, e-shopper CID016 belongs to the ninth cluster at timeT , since the fitness between CID016 and the rules are =FD2016 0.2 and =FD 1 016 0.2001. Therefore, we predict that the products which e-shopper CID016 is likely to buy are Bread, and Biscuit  TABLE V.

In this study, we describe a new approach for mining the changes of e-shopper  purchase behavior over time and discuss solutions to several problems. For predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior, the following concepts are proposed: BP j SDij and FDij . The SOM technique is used to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. The purchase sequences are derived from the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper. The sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. Then the sequential purchase patterns are stored in the rule database Finally, we give the example to elaborate the new methodology. The research presented in this paper makes a 155 contribution to mining  e-shoppers purchase behavior basing on transaction data. E-retailer may be able to perform effective  one-to-one marketing campaigns by providing individual target e-shoppers with personalized Product basing on using purchase sequences In the future, some possible extensions to this work are as 


follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
