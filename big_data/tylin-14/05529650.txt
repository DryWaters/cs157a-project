In the system, the model of association rules are established. Using this model, the system provide ability that arrange much more reasonable training plan for each early warning air roster. Furthermore, it can support an optimized decision of how to make up the team of rosters Keywords- intelligence analysis; simulation training system early warning air I. INTRODUCTION A great deal of useful data are saved when early warning air roster are trained which are not fully utilized!/] . We use data mining technology to discover training data patterns and trends!2,31. In the paper, these patterns and trends are defmed as the mining models. They are used to provide a higher level training and arrange more reasonable training plan for each early warning air roster. Moreover, they can provide optimized decision for how to make up the team of roster II. THE SIMULATION TRAINING SYSTEM FOR EARL Y WARNING AIR ROSTER Currently the main design objective of military simulation training systems is that the training process is true as far as possible and the training intensity is meeting its objectives and so on. It does not pay much attention to enhancing training value. Therefore, we sought to design a new simulation training system for early warning air roster to make better use of the historical data in the training database which is not only for technical and tactical training, but also for intelligence analysis by embedding data mining tools A. The Architecture of the Early Warning Air Roster Simulation Training System Data mining systems are usually not directly get user information from the user interface because the data required for data mining system are stored in the database. Hence, the 


traditional two-tier C / S mode can not be used to implement data mining system. We adopted a three-tier system architecture model to meet the needs for data mining which treat separate information acquisition, information analysis, and information storage, as shown in Figure 1 Three-tier framework of the system includes interactive layer, analysis layer and data layer. The main function of the tf Data I Miming ? Information r--Graphing ? Database In[crface ? E Intelligence W Analysis 8 - Analysis .... V Database  Trainee Management ? Knowledge Point Interacti ve Layer Analysis Layer Data Layer Figure 1. System Architechture interactive layer is to display intelligence, accept the operation of combat service personnel, and present the system analysis results to him. It is also responsible for interacting with geographic information systems. Analysis layer is mainly concentrated on the analysis and processing functions. Whenever a new combat service personnel to participate in training, the layer generates an analysis proxy object for him. The analysis proxy object will record and analyze the tactical combat operations of those who participate in the training. It also records that the training progress and technical status of the current trainees In this model, we focused on data mining subsystem. It works as follows. Firstly, both current status information and past training information in database are analyzed by data mining subsystem. Secondly, the factors that affect the operations of early warning air roster and the information of how to improve training methods can be obtained. Thirdly they are provided to the combat personnel management system \(CPMS reports and give the gaps between trainees with high levels So that teachers could have complete control of the current training effects B. The Training Evaluation of Early Warning Air Roster 


Rosters are the main body throughout the simulation training system. Personalized training system must always track the technical state of those participating in the training and the training progress, identify key factors that affect training effect, provide evaluation, and brought forward tips and advice information. The evaluation items are divided into the following five profiles 1 system of early warning air roster will real-timely record all 978-1-4244-6370-11$26.00  2010 IEEE V4-427 20i 0 2nd international Conference on Education Technology and Computer \(ICETC operation of trainees. The basic training infonnation can be obtained by evaluating the accuracy and the time ration of the operations of the trainees 2 simulation training system is that the combat service personnel master the perfonnance characteristics of control equipment as soon as possible and enhance their operating equipment ability. As for EWA, the most important capabilities are the early warning, command and control ones 3 The simulation training system for early warning air roster should not only serve to train the capacity of post individual but also should do to train the synergy of a team \(that is combat service group group can be evaluated by the overall completion for a given training scenario 4 assessed by the accumulating training time or the details of training time 5 parts. One is the scores of the trainees. The other is the knowledge and operation skills which are discovered by the data mining. The knowledge is the one that are easily forgotten and the one that are difficult to be mastered which should arrange more time for training. The operating skills are the one that should be arranged time to consolidate them III. DATA MINING MODELS OLAP \(Online Analytical Processing mining analysis techniques. It has the functions of summary 


consolidation and aggregation. It also has the ability of investigating the infonnation from various aspects. The infonnation contained in the data can be deeply understood through the OLAP system with a graphical user interface[4,51 This paper does not describe the preparation of data, data cleansing and consolidation, as well as details of mining algorithms. They will be introduced in other papers by the author [1,2,3,4]. This section describes one of the examples in the use of some typical data mining models for intelligence analysis in the simulation training system We use a rule-based algorithm to perfonn operations portfolio analysis. Thus correlation hide in the training operations can be found. Using this method, we found the mode of operation combination, which means we can found which operations are often carried out in the order. It will help designers optimize mUltiple operations as a combination for less response time and more convenience. In addition using this method, we construct the knowledge point structure chart, which used to discover the association of operations between a precursor to a successor correlation We apply it in the personalized training of combat service personnel. Therefore we need to create a data mining model for associated action sequence according to the operation history of trainees. The algorithm's parameters are set by the typical values 1. Item sets We do some filtering the item sets found by the algorithm. Filter conditions are that supports is bigger that 100, the minimum item sets size is equal to 3, and it must include the A operation. In table I, A to F indicates the different operations TABLE I. ITEM SETS Support size Item sizes 122 3 A-1,B-1,C-1 121 3 A=1,0=1,E=1 120 4 A=1 ,0=1 ,F=1 ,E=1  2. Rules Probability is the likelihood of a rule that is triggered Importance is that the usable rate of rules. The higher value means more useful the rule is. For these rules, it may be misleading if we only use the probability. Therefore, we use 


both the probability and importance to investigate the rules In the table II, we know from the first rule that if a trainee operates A and B operation, the probability that he will carry out C operation is 0.762 We know from the third rule that if a trainee operates F and A operation, the probability that he will carry out E operation is 0.721. Furthennore, this rule is more useful than the first rule Probability 0.762 0.825 0.721  D D TABLE II Importance 0.735 0.902 1.430  Selected Node Nodes Predict It RULES Rules A=1,B=1->C=1 A=1,0=1->E=1 A=1,F=1->E=1  Bidirectional Predict Figure 2. Relevance Network Model 3. Relevance network V4-428 20i 0 2nd international Conference on Education Technology and Computer \(ICETC In order to study the relationship among different items we use a relevance network to fmd the interactions among items. In the figure 4, each node represents one item. For example, node A represents that there exists A operation in a transaction. The legend describes the mutual relations of the items in the model As shown in figure 2, node A predicts of the node B, C D and E. node B, C, D, E predict A also. This means that 


these items may appear in a transaction at the same time. In other words, if a trainee operates operation A, he may also do operations B, C, D, E 4. Personalized training The essential function of individual simulation training system is providing important and difficult points in the training process. Through the relevance network, we construct a knowledge-point chart. Suppose that a knowledge point is formed by one or more foundation operations Figure 3. Inheritance Structure Map Before to be trained a new operating skill, the trainees are required to master some basic operational capability. We build an inheritance structure map to fmd out the correlations among the operations according to their relationship in the relevance network, as shown in Figure 5. For instance, if the trainees are to be trained to master the operator C I, they should master the operations from Al to An previously. If we fmd that the trainees do not master Fl operation thoroughly, we can trackback the knowledge-point chart to see if they do not master Dl or El operation. And we can also see from the map the operators C 1 and C2 have many backward branches, which mean that C 1 and C2 are critical to further training. So it should be trained intensively The some lost points of a specific trainee can be found after training. We use the knowledge point chart to fmd its foregoing operations. By strengthen the foregoing operations it can help the trainee improve their operation ability faster IV. CONCLUSION We studied and implemented a simulation trammg system for early warning air roster. The system uses data mining technology in training early warning air roster. It provides the personalized training plan for each early warning air roster according to his operational characteristics, and commanders can optimize team members according to the characteristics of combat service task REFERENCES 1] Yang Yuhai, Early warning air application research report, AFRA Wuhan, Hubei, 2009 2] Yang Yuhai, A new trainning mode for early warning air radar combat service personnel, in Proceedings of 2009 forum of China Education Association, 2009.12

probability of X. To determine P\(H|X determine P\(X|H H X from the data used for training [10]. For nave Bayes classifier, the steps to predict child obesity probability for data sample X is as follows First, calculate the posterior probability conditioned on X. Sample X will be assigned to class Ci if and only if \(7 7 P \(Ci|X 8  P\(X P\(X|Ci Ci then all classes are assumed as equally likely. Therefore P\(X|Ci P\(X|Ci Ci Ci 9 where NU1 is the number of training samples that belong to class Ci, and  NU is the total number of training samples [10 Then, assume that all the attributes are independent of each other \(no dependence relation among them applied 10 P\(x1|Ci x2|Ci xn|Ci training samples. If Ak is categorical, then  11 where NUik is the number of training samples of class Ci for nominal value xk for Ak, and NUi is the number of training samples belonging to Ci Next \(8 9 10 7 sample X to the class Ci with the highest probility P\(X|Ci Ci prediction when the attributes are independent and when applied to a large database [10 C. Decision Tree One system that uses the decision tree technique is a weight management counseling system for obese children. The system contains two modules, a Knowledge Management Module and Case Based Reasoning Module, as shown in Fig. 6. The Knowledge Management Module has three components: a data 


repository, a knowledge miner and a case based rule structure In the knowledge miner component, the decision tree technique is used to build trees from a database of cases. The decision tree technique is also used in the Case Based Reasoning Module to find possible solutions to a new child case [11 A decision tree starts with root attributes and ends with leaf nodes. Usually it has several branches which represent classes Below, we show an example of decision tree algorithm that was used for childhood obesity prediction [10 The tree is generated based on information-gain measure The steps are as follows.  Calculate  12  13  where pi is the probability that an arbitrary sample belongs to class C                   Figure 6.  Child weight management counseling system architecture [11      


Then, calculate the entropy E\(Ai based on partitioning by attribute Ai  as follows  14   15  where Pij = sij / | Sj |, and | Sj | is the number of samples in subset Sj. Then by branching on Ai, the encoding information that would be gained is  16 For the root node, the attribute Ai with the highest information gain is selected. Then the branches are built based on different values of aij, j = 1,,q. The tree will grow until all the samples are in same class, at which point the node becomes a leaf and is labeled with that class [10]. Fig.7 shows a graphical example of a decision tree for an obesity problem. S1, S2, and S3 in Fig. 7 refer to the solutions of the obesity problem IV. DISCUSSION In this section, we discuss the effectiveness, efficacy, strengths and weaknesses of the three data mining techniques. We also include the challenge within the problem and its applicability to other adult diseases. Table 1 summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of each technique discussed ANN, nave Bayes classifier, and decision tree are data mining techniques that are applicable for childhood obesity prediction. For ANN, environment is considered as an important factor for childhood obesity prediction. The prediction result can be more promising because environment undeniably plays major role in a childs growth. The nave Bayes classifier focuses more on the childs personal attributes rather than the environment. However, the result of nave Bayes classifier has been proven acceptable for childhood obesity prediction [10       


     Table I.  Data mining methods comparison Technique Strengths Weaknesses Artificial Neural Networks \(ANN  1. Can handle a large amount of input data   2. Fault tolerance and low energy consumption  1.  Efficiencies \(error vs network size problem dependent 2.   The run time speed may be slow when many problems are involved Nave Bayes 1. Accurate when sample attributes are independent 2. Simple and computationally efficient  1.  High bias 2.  Less accurate and performance degrades when attribute are dependent Decision Tree 1. Fast learning and classification speed 2.  Results in humanunderstandable rules  1.  Prone to error if there 


are many classes and a relatively small number of training examples 2.  Can be computationally expensive to train  For the decision tree, we see that the technique is easier to build than the other two methods since various attributes can be used for childhood obesity prediction In the future, we will work on hybridizing two or more applicable data mining methods. We hope that the results will be better than current methods available.  Our goal is to increase the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of predictions, and reduce the cost \(time and space methods. We will also increase our efforts to find better solutions to childhood obesity                 Figure 7. A decision tree for an obesity problem [11 The main challenge within this problem is to successfully predict obesity at an early age. As we know, it is difficult to identify potentially obese children when they are still young Their parent\(s become obese when they grow up. Many factors are related to obesity, including environment, family, lifestyle and habits Obesity may lead to many co-morbidity disorders such as type 


2 diabetes, cardiovascular, early puberty, suicide, smoking bulimia, poor self image, social isolation and hypertension [1 If obesity prediction is successful, then early prevention steps can be taken The data mining techniques outlined above have also been used to predict other adult diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases [12][13]. The similarities with childhood obesity prediction are the way data was collected and the risk factors, while the differences are the input and output of the prediction and how the techniques were implemented for that purpose V. CONCLUSION This survey has shown that data mining can be used to successfully predict childhood obesity. The three methods presented  ANN, nave Bayes, and decision tree  are proven applicable to childhood obesity prediction.  These methods each have their weaknesses and strengths; thus, further improvements of the techniques are necessary to fully resolve the childhood obesity prediction problem. This survey also reminds the reader about co-morbidity of childhood obesity and why it is important to prevent it at early age ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia \(USM REFERENCES  1] A.
