Identifying HotSpots in Lung Cancer Data Using Association Rule Mining Ankit Agrawal and Alok Choudhary Dept of Electrical Engg and Computer Science Northwestern University 2145 Sheridan Rd Evanston IL 60201 USA Email  ankitag,choudhar  eecs.northwestern.edu Abstract We analyze the lung cancer data available from the SEER program with the aim of identifying hotspots using association rule mining techniques A subset of 13 patient attributes from the SEER data were recently linked with the survival outcome using prediction models which is used in this study for segmentation The goal here is to identify 
characteristics of patient segments where average survival is signiìcantly higher/lower than average survival across the entire dataset Automated association rule mining techniques resulted in hundreds of rules from which many redundant rules were manually removed based on domain knowledge The resulting rules conform with existing biomedical knowledge and provide interesting insights into lung cancer survival Keywords Association rule mining hotspots lung cancer I I NTRODUCTION Lung cancer ranks second in the list of most common cancers and rst in the list of most deadly cancers  with the survi v al rate being about 15 after 5 years of diagnosis 
The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute is an author itative repository of cancer statistics in the United States  It is a population-based cancer re gistry which co v ers about 26 of the US population across several geographic regions and is the largest publicly available domestic cancer dataset The data includes patient demographics cancer type and site stage rst course of treatment and follow-up vital status The SEER program collects cancer data for all invasive and in situ cancers except basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and in situ carcinomas of the uterine cervix The SEER limited-use data is a v ailable from the SEER website on submitting a SEER limited 
use data agreement form presents an o v ervie w study of the cancer data at all sites combined and on selected frequently occurring cancers from the SEER data The SEER data attributes can be broadly classiìed as demographic attributes e.g age gender location diagnosis attributes e.g primary site histology grade tumor size treatment attributes e.g surgical procedure radiation therapy and outcome attributes e.g survival time cause of death which makes the SEER data ideal for performing outcome analysis studies Recently lung cancer data from SEER was used to construct predictive models for lung cancer survival after 6 months 9 months 1 year 2 years and 5 years of diagnosis 
using several machine techniques In this w ork we use same dataset with 13 predictor attributes as used for the lung cancer outcome calculator in for association rule mining analysis The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II gives an overview of association rule mining and describes the HotSpot algorithm used in this work followed by a description of the data and its attributes in Section III Experiments and results are presented in Section IV and nally the conclusion and future work in Section V II A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING Association rule mining is often stated as follows Let 
I be a set of n binary attributes called items Let T be a set of transactions Each transaction in T contains a subset of the items in I  A rule is deìned as an implication of the form X 002 Y where X Y 003 I and X 004 Y  002  The sets of items 
X and Y are called antecedent left-hand-side or LHS and consequent right-hand-side or RHS of the rule respectively A commonly given example from market basket analysis is of the rule  Bread 002 Butter   meaning that customers who buy bread also buy butter Association rule mining is popularly done with ag attributes indicating the presence/absence of the item in the transaction However even from nominal attributes having multiple but nite possible values and numeric attributes it is possible to derive ag attributes for the purpose of 
association rule mining HotSpot Algorithm This is an association rule mining algorithm which is directed by a target attribute which means that the RHS or consequent is xed to the target attribute It can be used for segmentation with both nominal and numeric targets where the LHS or antecedent would deìne the segment characteristics for segments which are signiìcantly different from the entire dataset in terms of the target attribute For example if the target is a numeric attribute like the patient survival time and the average patient survival time is t avg

then it would be interesting to nd segments in the data where the average patient survival time is higher/lower than t avg  Similarly if the target is a nominal attribute like 5year-survival whether or not a patient survived for at least 5 years and the fraction of survived patients in the entire dataset is f  then it would be interesting to nd segments where this fraction is higher/lower than f  It uses a greedy approach to construct the tree of rules in a depth-ìrst fashion where the search is constrained by the following parameters 1 Maximum branching factor  The number of children nodes to consider at each node This parameter controls the amount of search performed since the algorithm uses a greedy search 2 Minimum improvement in target value  This is the minimum improvement in the target value of the resulting segment in order to consider adding a new branch 3 Minimum segment size  The size of the resulting segment must be at least this much in order to add a new branch The HotSpot algorithm then is straightforward It begins with the entire dataset at the top and goes down the data in a depth-ìrst fashion using a greedy approach i.e it branches on that attribute which gives the maximum improvement in target value subject to the above constraints and recursively tries the same at every node Each node represents a segment and hence an association rule The improvement in the target value can be deìned as either an increase or a decrease in the average target value in case of numeric targets or target fraction in case of nominal targets We use the implementation of the HotSpot algorithm provided in the WEKA data mining toolkit III L UNG C ANCER D ATA FOR A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING The lung cancer outcome calculator mentioned earlier uses the data from the SEER November 2008 Limited-Use Data les released in April 2009 from nine SEER registries Atlanta Connecticut Detroit Hawaii Iowa New Mexico San Francisco-Oakland Seattle-Puget Sound and Utah This data had a follow-up cutoff date of December 31 2006 i.e the patients were diagnosed and followed-up upto this date Subsequently the data was selected for the patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2001 due to various reasons mentioned in the primary being that it allo wed predictive modeling of survival of upto 5-years since the follow-up cutoff date was December 31 2006 data used was for cancer patients with year of diagnosis as 2001 or before The lung cancer outcome calculator uses the following 13 patient attributes 1 Age at diagnosis  Numeric age of the patient at the time of diagnosis for lung cancer 2 Birth place  The place of birth of the patient 3 Cancer grade  A descriptor of how the cancer cells appear and how fast they may grow and spread 4 Diagnostic conìrmation  The best method used to conìrm the presence of lung cancer 5 Farthest extension of tumor  The farthest documented extension of tumor away from the lung either by contiguous extension regional growth or distant metastases cancer spreading to other organs far from primary site through bloodstream or lymphatic system 6 Lymph node involvement  The highest speciìc lymph node chain that is involved by the tumor Cancer cells can spread to lymph nodes near the lung which are part of the lymphatic system the system that produces stores and carries the infection-ìghtingcells This can often lead to metastases 7 Type of surgery performed  The surgical procedure that removes and/or destroys cancerous tissue of the lung performed as part of the initial work-up or rst course of therapy 8 Reason for no surgery  The reason why surgery was not performed if not 9 Order of surgery and radiation therapy  The order in which surgery and radiation therapies were administered for those patients who had both surgery and radiation 10 Scope of regional lymph node surgery  It describes the removal biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node\(s at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event 11 Cancer stage  A descriptor of the extent the cancer has spread taking into account the size of the tumor depth of penetration metastasis etc 12 Number of malignant tumors in the past An integer denoting the number of malignant tumors in the patientês lifetime so far 13 Total regional lymph nodes examined  An integer denoting the total number of regional lymph nodes that were removed and examined by the pathologist Table I presents the attributes of the lung cancer dataset and Tables II-X present the possible values and codes of all the nominal attributes except birth place since there are too many possible values for birth place For association rule mining analysis we removed all missing/unknown values since we are interested in nding segments with precise deìnitions in terms of patient attributes The survival time in months was chosen as the target attribute for the HotSpot algorithm The dataset had 13,033 instances 13 input patient attributes and 1 target attribute The average survival time in the entire dataset was 24.45 months So we would be interested to nd segments of patients where the average survival time is signiìcantly

data from SEER to identify hotspots in the cancer data where the patient survival time is signiìcantly higher than and lower than the average survival time across the entire dataset We believe that such analysis can be very useful to identify the factors affecting survival and aid doctors and patients in avoiding the conditions which are known to reduce survival time and encourage the conditions which are known to increase the survival time whenever possible It can also aid doctors in decision making and improve informed patient consent by providing a better understanding of the risks involved in a particular treatment procedure Similar analysis can also be done for other cancers A CKNOWLEDGMENT We thank the SEER program to make their limited-use data available for this work This

Experimental results We use the following measures in the evaluation of classification: Precision \(P R F1 The experimental results are shown in TABLE D. Experimental Analysis Comparing the results of non extended and extended with I1, we know that the co-occurrence relationships can be taken as useful extra information to help short-text classification The results of extended with I1, extended with I2 extended with I3 and extended with I4 show that confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength can improve the quality of feature extension mode respectively. Especially category homoplasy it can make short-text classification result to the best Table. ? indicates that the feature extension mode libraries with different quality play different roles for short-text classification. With the improvement of the quality of feature extension mode library, the role of extension for short-text concept is enhancing or the classification result is improving on the whole We can also see that the degree of improvement is small; even there is decline, such as finance and automobile. By analyst, there are some reasons as follows\(1 modes in the feature extension mode library is too few, leading that the information coverage in it is limited and the extension chance for term is small 2 accurate enough and could bring some noise into texts by extension; \(3 text also have an influence on its classification result 4 suitable for Chinese short-text classification V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we study how to construct a high-quality feature extension mode library for short-text classification 


And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
