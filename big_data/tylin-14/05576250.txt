The concept of fuzzy sets is used to handle quantitative transactions and the process of genetic calculation is executed to find appropriate membership functions. The main contributions of this paper are that we first divided the genetic-fuzzy mining problems into four kinds according to the types of fuzzy mining problems and the ways of processing items. Then, each of the four kinds of problems has been described with some approaches given Keywords: Data Miining; Fuzzy Set Theory; Genetic Algorithms; Fuzzy Data Mining; Genetic-Fuzzy Data Mining I.  INTRODUCTION \(HEADING 1 In real applications, quantitative transaction data exists and should also be considered. Since fuzzy set theory is being used more and more frequently in intelligent systems because of its simplicity and similarity to human reasoning lots of fuzzy data mining algorithms have thus been proposed [5, 8 Most of these fuzzy data mining algorithms assume the membership functions are already known. In fuzzy mining 


problems, the given membership functions may, however have a critical influence on the final mining results Developing effective and efficient approaches to derive both the appropriate membership functions and fuzzy association rules automatically are thus worth to be studied Genetic algorithms are widely used for finding membership functions in different fuzzy applications. In this article, we discuss the genetic-fuzzy data mining approaches which can mine both appropriate membership functions and fuzzy association rules [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9]. Thus, the main contributions of the work are: 1 mining problems into four categories; 2 fuzzy mining approaches of each of them are described with some approaches given II. LEARNING MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS There were several strategies proposed for learning membership functions in classification or control problems by genetic algorithms. Below are some of them 1. Learning membership functions first, then rules 2. Learning rules first, then membership functions 3. Simultaneously learning rules and membership functions 4. Iteratively learning rules and membership functions For fuzzy mining problems, many researches have also been done by combining the genetic algorithm and the fuzzy concepts to discover both suitable membership functions and useful fuzzy association rules from quantitative values However, most of them adopt the first strategy. It is done in this way because the number of association rules is often large in mining problems and can not easily be coded in a chromosome III. GENETIC-FUZZY DATA MINING TECHNIQUES In this article, we introduce several genetic-fuzzy data mining algorithms that can mine both appropriate membership functions and fuzzy association rules. They can be divided into four kinds according to the types of fuzzy mining problems and the ways of processing items. The types of fuzzy mining problems include single-minimumsupport fuzzy-mining and multiple-minimum-support fuzzymining. The ways of processing items include processing all the items together \(integrated approach 


them individually \(divide-and-conquer approach the four kinds of genetic-fuzzy data mining problems will be introduced in the following sections A. The Integrated Genetic-Fuzzy Problem for Items with a Single Minimum Support \(IGFSMS Many approaches have been published for solving the IGFSMS problem [1, 3, 6, 7, 9]. For example, Hong et al proposed a genetic-fuzzy data-mining algorithm for extracting both association rules and membership functions from quantitative transactions [3]. They proposed a GAbased framework for searching membership functions suitable for given mining problems and then use the final best set of membership functions to mine fuzzy association rules. It first transforms each set of membership functions into a fixed-length string. The chromosome is then evaluated by the number of large 1-itemsets and the suitability of membership functions. The number of large 12010 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing 978-0-7695-4161-7/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/GrC.2010.169 28 itemsets is obtained by using the set of membership functions in the chromosome. The suitability measure is used to reduce the occurrence of two bad types of membership functions, which are too redundant and too separate. Two factors, called the overlap factor and the coverage factor, are used to avoid the bad shapes Based on Hongs approach, Alcala-Fdez et al. then also proposed a genetic-fuzzy data mining approach by using 2tuples linguistic representation model. Besides, Kaya and Alhaji also proposed several genetic-fuzzy data mining approaches to derive membership functions and fuzzy association rules [6, 7]. In [6], the proposed approach tries to derive membership functions, which can get a maximum profit within an interval of user-specified minimum support values. It then uses the derived membership functions to mine fuzzy association rules. Kaya and Alhaji also extended the approach to mine fuzzy weighted association rules [7 B. The Integrated Genetic-Fuzzy Problem for Items with Multiple Minimum Supports \(IGFMMS It can be seen that lots of researches focus on integrated genetic-fuzzy approaches for items with a single minimum 


support. However, different items may have different criteria to judge their importance. In such cases, the above approaches may not be suitable for this problem. Chen et al thus proposed another genetic-fuzzy data mining approach 2], which was an extension of the approach proposed in [3 to solve it. The approach combines the clustering, fuzzy and genetic concepts to derive minimum support values and membership functions for items. The final minimum support values and membership functions are then used to mine fuzzy association rules C. The Divide-and-Conquer Genetic-Fuzzy Problem for Items with a Single Minimum Support \(DGFSMS The advantages of the integrated genetic-fuzzy approaches lie in that they are simple, easy to use, and with few constraints in the fitness functions. In addition to the number of large 1-itemsets, the other criteria can also be used. However, if the number of items is large, the integrated genetic-fuzzy approaches may need lots of time to find a near-optimal solution because the length of a chromosome is very long. Hong et al. thus used a GA-based framework with the divide-and-conquer strategy to search for membership functions suitable for the mining problem 4 In the phase of mining membership functions, it maintains m populations of membership functions, with each population for an item. Each chromosome in a population represents a possible set of membership functions for that item. The fitness of each set of membership functions is evaluated by the fuzzy-supports of the linguistic terms in large 1-itemsets and by the suitability of the derived membership functions. The offspring sets of membership functions undergo recursive evolution until a good set of membership functions has been obtained. Next in the phase of mining fuzzy association rules, the sets of membership function for all the items are gathered together and used to mine the fuzzy association rules from the given quantitative database D. The Divide-and-Conquer Genetic-Fuzzy Problem for Items with Multiple Minimum Supports \(DGFMMS The problem may be thought of as the combination of the IGFMMS and the DGFSMS problems. The framework for the DGFMMS problem can thus be easily designed from the 


previous frameworks for IGFMMS and DGFSMS IV. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Data mining is very important in the information era especially when the data amounts are extremely large. The research in this topic will continuously grow but on a variety of forms. Some possible research directions in the future about genetic-fuzzy data mining are listed as follows 1 functions and different genetic operators; 2 performance of the fuzzy-rule mining phase; 3 visual tools for these genetic-fuzzy mining approaches; 4 Extending these approaches to solve other kinds of knowledge REFERENCES 1] J.

K-Means clustering algorithm is as the follows Step1: Divide the non- center domain concepts into the clusters of nearest center Step2: Choose new centers from the clusters where similarity of domain concepts must exceed the appointed value Repeat step1, 2 until the obtained centers or cluster set become stable C. Extraction of Non-taxonomy Relations Compared to the extraction of taxonomy relations, the extraction of non-taxonomy is more difficult. Extracting the related concept pairs is the key. The method based on association rules mining is adopted to extract related concept pairs. The algorithm of extracting related concept pairs is as follows Output: the set of related concept pairs 117  Step1: Construct a concept pair set by gathering every two different concepts Step2: For each concept pair in the set, calculate the support and the confidence based on association rules mining algorithm If both support and confidence satisfy MinSup and MinConf, the concept pair is related; else the pair must be deleted V.

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
