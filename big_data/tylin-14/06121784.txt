topic in the last years and limited works such as Ishibuchiês et al ha v e e xplored the use of multi-objecti v e algorithms for extracting association rules This paper addresses the extraction of association rules applying AP which has recently demonstrated to be a very promising technique for addressing another data mining task such as classiìcation The algorithm proposed in this paper follows a multi-objective approach looking for the simultaneous acquisition of very frequent and reliable rules It is also based on the use of a context-free grammar CFG that limits the search space and ensures the creation of valid individuals Its effectiveness has been tested over several data sets and compared to other well-known algorithms proving that AP is a good technique for ARM and also that this task can be successfully tackled from a multi-objective perspective This paper is arranged as follows Section II describes the proposed algorithm Section III presents the data sets used in the experiments and the experimental set-up In Section IV the results obtained are shown and analyzed Finally concluding remarks are made in Section V II T HE PROPOSED MULTI OBJECTIVE AP MODEL FOR ARM This section introduces the fundamentals of the developed AP algorithm for mining association rules presenting its particular features and a pseudocode of the model A Environment and individual encoding The algorithm proposed is founded on the use of a CFG which deìnes all the possible states that individuals can visit This grammar plays the role of the set of terminals and functions in automatic programming restricting the search space and ensuring any solution to be valid The CFG is expressed in Backus-Naur form notation and its deìnition is given by G   N   T  P  S  as shown in Figure 1  N represents the set of non-terminal symbols  T is the set of terminal symbols P is the set of production rules and S stands for the start symbol The environment deìned by the grammar which permits ants to communicate indirectly with each other adopts the shape of a derivation tree From the initial state ants follow a path over the environment until reaching a nal state or solution Each individual stores the path followed fulìlling the properties of an artiìcial ant Therefore each individual encodes an association rule and the last state of the path directly corresponds to the evaluatable expression of this rule expressed in preìx notation The treatment of the environment generation is also important The algorithm follows an incremental build approach in which as ants are created visited states are stored in a data structure This way there is no need of keeping in memory the whole space of states storing just the necessary states which is translated into less computational requirements G   N   T  P  S   N   Rule Antecedent Consequent Condition   T    AND   attr 1  attr 2   attr n  value 1  1  value 1  2   value 1 m  value 2  1  value 2  2   value 2 m   value n 1  value n 2   value n,m  S   Rule  P   Rule   Antecedent Consequent Antecedent  Condition  Antecedent Condition Consequent  Condition Condition  all possible valid combinations of the ternary operator attr value  Figure 1 Context-free grammar B Multi-objective evaluation The quality of individuals generated is assessed on the basis of two objectives support and conìdence As mentioned in the previous section the last state of the path of a given ant directly encodes the expression of the association rule The rst step in the evaluation of an association rule is to check whether this expression is consistent with a valid rule i.e if there are no coincidences between attributes in the antecedent and the consequent of the rule If there is a match the individual is discarded Once the previous condition has been veriìed support and conìdence metrics are calculated Support and conìdence are two measures widely employed in ARM The support of an association rule A  C indicates the proportion of the number of transactions T including both the antecedent and the consequent in the data set D  as shown in Equation 1 sup  A  C   A  C  T,T  D    D  1 Thus support involves frequency of appearing patterns In turn conìdence Equation 2 represents the proportion of the number of transactions including both the antecedent and the consequent among that transactions in the data set that include the antecedent It is a measure of the strength of implication of an association rule conf  A  C  sup  A  C  sup  A    A  C  T,T  D   A  T,T  D  2 Pareto dominance asserts that a given individual ant 1 dominates another individual ant 2  denoted as ant 1  ant 2  if ant 1 is not worse than ant 2 on all the objectives and better in at least one of them The non-dominated set of solutions of a population makes up the Pareto front 972 2011 11th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 


By the time all individuals have been evaluated regarding support and conìdence a tness value is calculated for each one using ranks organizing the population in fronts of non-dominated individuals in a similar procedure to that followed in the NSGA2 algorithm The tness assigned to a given individual corresponds to the inverse value of the front to which it belongs This way individuals of the Pareto front will receive a tness value of 1 individuals of the second front a value of 1/2 and so on After each individual in the population has been evaluated and has a tness value associated reinforcement and evaporation processes take place C Heuristic measure The AP algorithm proposed considers a heuristic function with two complementary components The rst one is a measure related to the cardinality of the production rules involved in the transition based on the cardinality measure proposed by It is referred to as P card  and it increments the probability of choosing transitions that let ants to reach more candidate solutions This metric is only used in case of intermediate transitions which are those that do not imply the selection of attributes of the problem domain This is because nal transitions embrace the same number of solutions independently of the movement selected by the ant The value of P card suppossing a transition between a source state i and a destination state j  where there are k possible subsequent states is computed as follows P card k ij  cardinality  state j d  1   k  allowed  cardinality  state k d  1 3 where d is the number of derivations that remain available at the depth of the source state i  As can be observed it is equal to the ratio between the number of candidate solutions that can be successfully reached from the state j in d  1 derivations and the sum of all possible candidate solutions that can be reached from the source state i in d derivations In case of nal transitions the metric used is the support of the condition encoded by each destination state The support metric is computed for each possible combination of operator-attribute-value before starting up the grammar Notice that according to the grammar deìned in Figure 1 conditions involving the operators  and  are allowed The operator  favors to obtain a higher support in domains where there are itemsets that are not very frequent D Transition probability Each step forward taken by a given ant during its solution construction obeys a probability rule This rule takes into account both the pheromones spread over the environment by ants of previous generations and the heuristic function explained before It is called transition rule and the probability that a given ant located at the state i at some point moves to another state j is computed as shown in Equation 4 P k ij    ij      ij    k  allowed   ik      ik   4 where k is the number of valid subsequent states  is the heuristic exponent  is the pheromone exponent  is the value of the heuristic function computed as sup  Condition  P card having at least one of the two components equal to zero and  indicates the strength of the pheromone trail When computing the transition rule the algorithm controls that the movement to the state j allows to reach nal states in the number of derivations that remain available at that point If not the algorithm assigns a probability of zero to this state and therefore it will never be chosen E Pheromone evaporation and reinforcement Two categories can be differentiated depending on how pheromone information is treated by multi-objective antbased algorithms algorithms that use a single pheromone matrix or those that employ a pheromone matrix per objective to be optimized Our algorithm falls into the rst group which involves a beneìt with respect to memory and computational time requirements Concerning the pheromone operations existent two operations are considered reinforcement and evaporation Regarding the former all ants in the current population deposit pheromones in their path according to Equation 5 proportionally to its raking tness  ij  t 1  ij  t   rankF itness 5 where  ij  t  indicates the existing quantity of pheromone in the transition from state i to state j   ij  t 1 states for the new amount of pheromones that will be in the same transition after the pheromone deposition and rankF itness is the tness ranking assigned to each individual according to Pareto dominance as explained in Section II-B All transitions in the path of a given individual are reinforced equally The evaporation takes place over the whole space of states For a given transition the amount of pheromone after performing the evaporation is computed as shown in Equation 6  ij  t 1  ij  t   1    6 where  represents the evaporation rate Finally a normalization process follows the other pheromone maintenance operations in order to limit the pheromone levels in each transition to the range   min  max  2011 11th International

the discretization of such data sets comprising numeric attributes The algorithm used for this purpose was the Fayyad and Iraniês discretization algorithm Both preprocessing actions were perfomed by using Weka 2 21 B Algorithms and experimental set-up Our AP algorithm is evaluated against other ARM algorithms belonging to several paradigms a grammar-guided genetic programming algorithm G3PARM 3  a genetic algorithm ARMGA 4  and two exhaustive search algorithms Apriori 5 and FP-Growth 6  The parameter conìguration for the AP algorithm was adopted after performing several tests using different rank values for each parameter These executions were done over several representative data sets and then analyzing which speciìc set-up globally yielded the best results It is worth mentioning that no single combination of parameter values performed better for all data sets as expected Nevertheless notice that this adopted conìguration should be tuned for each particular data set This conìguration corresponds to a population size of 20 ants 100 generations a maximum number of 10 derivations an initial amount of pheromone and a maximum amount of pheromone of 1.0 a minimum amount of pheromone equal to 0.1 an evaporation rate of 0.05 a value of 0.4 for the alpha exponent a value of 1.0 for the beta exponent a 70 of support threshold and a maximum size for the set or rules returned of 20 Notice that this algorithm does not require a conìdence threshold For the G3PARM algorithm its optimal parameters were used a population size of 50 individuals 100 generations probabilities of 70 and 14 for crossover and mutation operators respectively a maximum derivation number of 24 an external population of size 20 a 90 of conìdence threshold and a 70 of support threshold In case of the ARMGA algorithm its optimal parameters are a population size of 50 individuals 100 generations 100 selection probability 90 of crossover and 1 of mutation probabilities a maximum rule length of 4 attributes and a 90 of conìdence threshold ARMGA does not employ support threshold For Apriori and FP-Growth in order to perform a fair comparison same support and conìdence thresholds used in the other algorithms were considered 2 The Weka machine learning software is publicly available at http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/index.html 3 G3PARM algorithm was executed using the implementation provided by the authors 4 ARMGA algorithm was run using the implementation available in the software KEEL that can be reached at http://www.keel.es 5 Apriori algorithm was run using the implementation accessible in Weka 6 FP-Growth algorithm was executed employing the implementation by F Coenen 2003 university of Liverpool http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk frans/KDD/Software/FPgrowth fpGrowth.html IV R ESULTS Experiments compare the average results of support Table I conìdence Table II and coverage Table IV achieved by each algorithm over the data sets considered showing also the average number of rules returned Table III It is worth noting that stochastic algorithms have been run ten times with different seeds in order to obtain unbiased results In contrast Apriori and FP-Growth which are deterministic were executed once The results obtained by every algorithm are summarized in a separate table per each metric considered where a single row displays the result obtained per algorithm for a given data set Bold type values indicate the algorithm that attains the best result for a particular data set At a glance it can be observed that the AP algorithm achieves the best support results in a 90 of the problems and also overcomes the other algorithms regarding coverage in a 90 of the cases Likewise ARMGA obtains the best results with respect to conìdence metric for all the data sets On the other hand Apriori and FP-Growth are exhaustive search algorithms so that they nd all the possible relations that meet the support and conìdence restrictions Nevertheless they are not able to nd any association rule for wine vehicle and nursery data sets indicated with n/a not available This is because both algorithms only consider the equal operator in conditions In contrast G3PARM and AP also use the not equal operator which allows to nd high support results in data sets having unfrequent itemsets In the case of ARMGA it is capable of discovering rules in the mentioned problems because it has no support threshold Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms return a large set of association rules as they perform an exhaustive search In contrast nature inspired methods as ARMGA AP and G3PARM extract a reduced set of high quality rules thus denoting more interesting patterns For instance ARMGA mines 100 rules having the maximum average conìdence and AP mines 20 association rules with very high average support Looking at the instances covering results AP and G3PARM achieve best covering of the data sets although the number of rules is limited by the external population size Thus both algorithms are capable of mining more representative association rules To analyze statistically these results Friedmanês method was applied This test computes the average rankings obtained by k algorithms over N data sets regarding one metric Table V sums up the average ranking values of each algorithm for the three metrics studied The computed value for the Friedmanês statistic for average support distributed according to the F-distribution with k  1 and  k  1  N  1 degrees of freedom is 37.5116 for the conìdence metric its value is 42.8732 and 8.0777 for coverage None of them belongs to the critical interval at the  0  01 signiìcance 2011 11th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 975

with a probability of 90 Finally regarding the covering of the data set by the set of association rules extracted the AP model obtains signiìcant differences with respect to ARMGA with a 99 of probability and with exhaustive methods with a 95 of likelihood Future work lies in studying the employment of other heuristic metrics and other pheromone updating strategies to improve the performance of the algorithm On the other hand it would be interesting to extend the multi-objective approach considering more objectives to be optimized A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been supported

Dominant factors: Output value of industry, Secondary industry product, GPD, as well as Per capita GDP 2 D? A 0.649 3 G? A 0.644 4 B? A 0.613 5 R? A 0.575 Sub-dominant factors: Total value of imports and exports Per capita disposable income Non-agricultural population Total investment in fixed assets and Peak summer temperature 6 J? A 0.556 7 AB? A 0.555 8 F? A 0.537 9 V? A 0.520  The analytical result shows a heavy dependence of electricity consumption, and hence the power load growth, on industrial output value and per capita GDP Total value of imports and exports, income, nonagricultural population and total investment in fixed assets are found out as the sub-dominant factors to growth in electricity Weather conditions in summer influence peak load level, along with the proliferation of air conditioning load. Peak summer temperature is thus found relevant to some extent as well. The remaining 18 candidate variables, therefore, are suggested to be ignored in power load analysis and forecast V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have introduced a new data mining methodology to investigate association degrees between Chinese power load growth and 27 different candidate factors This methodology offers some advantages as, for example allowing us to properly extract interesting association rules from large historical database. By ordering confidence of selected rules, four dominant factors and five sub-dominant factors boosting the electricity consumption in China are identified, which can been adopted for better understanding the growth law and more accurately predicting the electricity demand Future work includes the development of a new prediction 


method for electricity demand using the dominant variables identified in this research as inputs.

means that the service is in the same branch, but at a lower level in the hierarchy of services execution. Therefore, this service will only be conducted if an error has occurred in the execution of the previous one. As shown in chart II the latter service uses an image resource in charge of showing some information at the MIDlet display and whose content is also stored on the device Besides, the MIDlet allows in a simple way to modify all those parameters that define the execution of the services and their use. As commented before, a user could not want that a service is executed automatically and requires manual confirmation. For that, he/she only would need to change the value of the execution parameter of the service into manual. In the same way, the user can activate or deactivate the use of resources just by modifying the value of the state attribute into off. Even more, it is possible to add new resources, if, together with their definition some content needed for their execution is included Therefore, it can be checked as, even when the user define an initial interaction for a scenario and even when the same deployment is done in different devices, each user could easily adapt and customize the interaction to its needs and preferences afterwards Equally, the user could activate or deactivate a service changing the execution order and modifying the hierarchy initially defined for them. Herewith, the same scenario could be customized and act in a different way depending of the person that interacts with it V. DISCUSSION IoT is not a reality yet, but a prospective view of a series of technologies that, combined, could sharply modify the interaction mode with our environment and the working of our society in the following years. In order to establish the IoT philosophy, it would be needed an advance of the development and dissemination of elements as sensors, new communication technologies \(as well as their intercommunication mobile devices able to integrate them, a proper infrastructure and above all software applications that supports them and are able to integrate all those elements, as well as to fulfills the needs and requirements of the users Those new systems must also be adapted to the different interaction scenarios and, mainly, to the different 


characteristics, requirements, preferences and needs of the people that interact with the environment. In this paper we present a model that provides a solution to this issue The model is based in augment different objects among a scenario with Tags, by the assignment of services and resources defined in an abstracted hierarchy that allows configuring a customized interaction model. Thus, for the same scenario, the model is able to define different interaction contexts. So, a context is defined as the aggregation of: a certain scenario formed by a set of intelligent objects offering a set of services, b characteristics, preferences and needs, c and d Under the proposed model a tool that allows the definition and scenario deployment has been built. A neuter MIDlet installed in the NFC device is the one in charge of guiding the 13 interaction through the definition of the scenarios stored in a XML file. This architecture allows that the same MIDlet could be used with any scenario and that the user could adapt the interaction to his preferences Currently we are working in the completeness of the model and the complex interaction scenarios generalization, being the latter based in rules systems that allows adapting the different interaction contexts to the users ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain \(MICINN Project TIN2009-07184 REFERENCES 1] M.

dataset contains a stream of TCP connection records from two weeks of LAN traffic over MIT Lincoln Labs. It consists of 42 attributes that usually characterize network traffic behavior, both categorical attributes and quantitative attributes such as duration of the connections, protocol type etc. Attribute src_byte denoting the number of data bytes from source to destination and attribute dst_bytes inverse are selected in this experiment.  They are both quantitative attributes The user specified parameters are set as follows 5, 0.3, 0.03, 0.01,W min_sup preMinsup T 0.5, 0.4, 30.min_confidence max_MFB min_num_triples And the number of transactions in each time slot is 250 It is assumed that there are no more than three fuzzy sets or intervals in the datasets i.e. 3F Four different approaches to mine association rules are compared using the following notations: Fuzzy+MFB: the approach that use both fuzzy method and MFB_measure with 1 3.0? = and 2 0 .5 2 0.5? = , Fuzzy+P: the approach using fuzzy method with 1 3.0? = and 2 0.5? = also but repressing the first part of the MFB_measure that ignores the changed rate of the membership function, Discrete1: the approach using discrete method with 1 2 1.5? ?= =  and Discrete2 : the approach using discrete method with 1 2 2.5 TABLE I.

Comparison of Execution Time Fig. 3 shows the execution time of the four approaches The runtimes of them grow linearly as the data stream grows which confirms that they are scalable with respect to the size of data stream, and it is mainly because of the usage of sliding window model. Fuzzy+P uses the least time Fuzzy+MFB has similar execution time to Discrete2, and Discrete1 has the most execution time. The difference of runtimes between them is mainly influenced by the clustering operations they use. The more clustering operations were executed, the more runtime it was Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the number of frequent itemsets and interesting rules found with the data stream increased Fuzzy+P and Fuzzy+MFB used less clustering operations than Discrete1 and Discrete2. Fuzzy+MFB nearly finds the most number of frequent fuzzy sets and interesting rules with the second least of clustering operations. Sometimes Discrete2 returns nearly the same number of fuzzy sets and interesting rules but with more clustering operations and the 


semantics of Discrete2 are meaningless as discussed in experiment one. Furthermore, the number of interesting rules found by Discrete1 is even less than Fuzzy+P that used the clustering operations least which illustrates the superiority of the method using fuzzy sets V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a novel fuzzy ARM algorithm called FFI_Stream is presented to tackle quantitative attributes in data streams and some techniques are proposed in the algorithm. Both synthetic and real datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.  In comparison with the discrete method, the proposed algorithm using fuzzy sets and MFB_measure gets a trade-off between the number of interesting rules and efficiency ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by The National High Technology Research and Development Program of China 863 Program 2008AA042902 Technology Research and Development Program of China 863 Program 2009AA04Z162 Project \(B07031 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Size of Databases\(250 N um be r o f F re qu e n t I

In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures. Figure 1 b cost for the sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
