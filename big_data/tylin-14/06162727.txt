1 Analysis of frequent episodes in sequences of incidents collected in power distribution systems Oscar Quiroga Joaquim Mel 264 endez Sergio Herraiz 264 Alvaro Ferreira and Alfredo Mu 230 noz Abstract 227Power distribution incidents collected by the electric utility through their customer service centers and incident management systems are analyzed systematically in this work An incident is de\002ned by the actions carried out by the utility to return the system to its normal operation when a failure occurrs A sequence of incidents is a set of dated incidents recorded in a region or a network during a period of time but only some subsets of them are of interest either because they present similar features or because they are related in a way that allows them to 
be considered together 050timing periodicity etc.\051 These subsets of signi\002cant incidents in a sequence are called episodes and are instances of possible patterns that de\002ne the behaviour of the system The analysis is oriented to extract useful information from sequences of historical data to recognize relevant episodes that show a pattern of behaviour which could be useful to forecast future incidents or assist planning and operation With this goal the authors evaluate the use of a pattern discovery algorithm in sequences of incidents gathered in a network as part of the case study Since the incidents can occur by random factors not all the frequent episodes that can be found are relevant Then it is proposed a methodology based on set theory to choose the relevant episodes which are especially useful to recognize outstanding episodes in sequences that have high randomness 
which is the case of sequences of incidents in electrical networks Index Terms 227Power system faults sequence of incidents incipient faults I I NTRODUCTION T he exploitation of information gathered from the network is one of the challenges posed by the smart grids The huge number and variety of components in networks 050overhead lines cables circuit breakers transformers fuses insulators etc.\051 that can be affected by failures makes dif\002cult to deploy monitoring strategies that individually supervise all of these elements Consequently new paradigms are needed to develop low cost solutions to assist maintenance policies They should be oriented to extract and exploit useful information from historical data 050call centers event repositories and power 
quality data bases control center data bases,etc.\051 and on-line events generated during both normal and abnormal conditions  2 This work is funded in part by the research project 223ENERGOSCEN20091048 Tecnolog 264 021as para la gesti 264 on automatizada e inteligente de las redes de distribuci 264 on energ 264 etica del futuro\224 050PROGRAMA CENIT-2009\051 and the Comissionat per a Universitats i Recerca del Departament d'Innovacio Universitats i Empresa of the Generalitat de Catalunya and also the European Social Fund under the FI grant 2011FI-B100144 O Quiroga J Mel 264 endez and S Herraiz are with the Institute of Informatics and Applications University of Girona 17071 Girona Spain e-mail

voltage Utilities usually use the term incident to indicate the existence of such faults or failures and the activity performed by the utlity to restore the normal operation of the system Examples of incidents are a failure in a cable by aging and its reparation or the actuation of protective system in the head of a feeder by a lightning followed by a restoration sequence Maintenance policies 050preventive based on condition monitoring etc\051 are implemented to reduce the impact of faults in the network Also fault prediction based on the early identi\002cation of symptoms or incipient faults leading to the appareance of faults is a topic of interest in power systems and several frameworks are available 6 7 8 9 Moreover the events generated by those faults can present different shapes depending on many factors such as the phases 
affected 050including number of phases unbalance...\051 the load 050presence of laterals affected load etc.\051 fault impedance 050high/low value pure resistive or not\051 type of affected line 050aerial cable or a combination of both\051 among others The study of signi\002cant features for each type of fault and the episode associated with them is a hot research topic because it offers possible ways to automatically diagnose the cause of the fault or to be used as a prediction tool Ho we v er  methods must be developed to improve the systematic analysis of events caused by faults and their propagation along the network in order to discover fault patterns associated with frequent causes and their origin or to maintain accurate fault diagnoses and predictions Automatic association among event records and incidents reported in the control center are also 
of great interest to improve knowledge of system performance and to contextualize the occurrence of faults in the system This work focuses on the incidents of the power systems that are reported in the control center and collect information from customer service centers and incident management systems The aim is to discover useful information from the analysis of sequences of those incident reports Since not all the incidents are produced by failures and they have different origin and causes the 002rst step is to recognize frequent and relevant episodes that shows a representative pattern of the incidents and could be used to forecast similar incidents in the future

002elds 050\002nancial series alarms in communication networks sequences of queries in databases sequences of customer transactions etc.\051 The task focuses on the discovery of temporal patterns called episodes that occur often in a sequence Episode discovery approach was proposed in and it w as generalized in 12 adding e xplicit time constraints and new methods for measuring the frequency of those episodes A sequence of events  S  is the set of events  e i  typically collected during a period of time 050 t 1 000 t n 051 S  S 050 t 1  t n 051  h e 1 050 t 1 051  e 2 050 t 2 051     e n 050 t n 051 i The events in S are sorted according to their time stamp 050 t i  t i 000 1  i  2  3     n\051 The length of the sequence S is denoted by j S j  n  An episode E  is an ordered collection of events 050 E  h e i  e j     e k i 051 in S 050 E 032 S 051 that occur together following an order relation 050partial order relation\051 The support is a measure of how frequent an event is appearing in the sequence Intuitively it can be simply de\002ned as the number of times that an event is found throughout the sequence Several algorithms have been developed to discover frequent episodes in sequences such as WINEPI and MINEPI in MINEPI in and the generalization of frequent episodes  All these methods are de\002ned to w ork with cate gorical events i.e there must be a set of event types that occur throughout the sequence The methods for discovering frequent episodes usually start the search with frequent events 050episodes of one event\051 and by an iterative procedure at each new step the algorithm computes a collection of candidate episodes built from the frequent episodes found in the previous level and then their frequency of occurrence is checked This procedure is called APRIORI  The algorithms proposed i n 11 and 12 contemplate the existence of more complex relations 050serial parallel or non-serial non-parallel\051 between events in the episode These algorithms differ mainly in the way of calculating the support of the episodes The general method can be summarized as 017 Input A sequence of events and the value of the minimun support 017 Initialize a counter equal to one 050 l 1\051 017 Build the 002rst set of candidates episodes of length one 050 C l 051 from the set of events types 017 While C l 6  fg 226 Calculate the support of each episode in C l  226 Keep the episodes with support greater than the minimum support 050 E l 051 226 Increase l 050 l  l  1 051 226 Build the set of candidates episodes of length l 050 C l 051 from the set of frequent episodes E l 000 1  Fig 1 Example of a sequence of events 017 Output For all l show E l  This procedure ensures that the frequent episodes of length l 050 l  1 051 are composed of l subepisodes of length l 000 1 that are also frecuents In this paper the WINEPI algorithm is used to discover the frequent episodes in sequences of incidents Then relevant episodes are selected from those frequent episodes based on probabilistic criteria that will be explained in section III In WINEPI the support of an episode is calculated using the sliding window paradigm An observation window w is de\002ned as the events occurred between two time instants t i and t i  t w  where t w is the width of the window in time units with t i 025 t 1 and t t  t w 024 t n  then w 050 t i  t i  t w 051  S 050 t i  t i  t w 051  This window moves along the sequence as it is shown in Fig 1 increasing the value of t i as t i  t s  where t s is the sliding time 050step\051 The support of each episode E is de\002ned as the percentage of windows in which the episode occurs f r 050 E S t w 051  j w 2 W 050 S t w 051 j E ocurrs in w j  j W 050 S t w 051 j where W 050 S t w 051 is the set of all windows w on S  The total number of windows on S is equal to 050 t n 000 t 1 051 t s  t w 000 1  According to Fig 1 an event will be observed in several windows If the 002rst window contain only the 002rst event and the last window contain only the last event of the sequence then all events are observed in an equal number of windows that is approximately equal to t w t s with 0  t s  t w  2  In Fig 1 the window width t w is 4 the sliding time t s is 1 and the total number of window is 8 Table I resumes the events observed in each window and the serial episodes whose support is greater or equal to 1/4 050it must be observed in at least two windows\051 Serial and parallel supports for each episode is also shown in Table I Notice that to compute the support of parallel episodes the order of the events in the episode is not taken into account Finally Table I shows that the frequent episodes of length l 050 l  1 051 are composed of l subepisodes of length l 000 1 that are also frecuents For example the episode h a b c i is composed of three episodes of length two h a b i  h a c i and h b c i  which are also frequents III F REQUENT AND RELEVANT EPISODES The occurrence of incidents in a grid over time is usually considered as a stochastic process i.e it is assumed that non-existent or unknown cause-effect relationships between different types of incidents and their appearance or origin can

EPISODES IN SEQUENCES OF INCIDENTS In this section several sequences of incidents ocurred in distribution feeders are analysed The main objetive is to 002nd frequent episodes in these sequences and to recognize relevant episodes that are related with component failures consistent with the concepts presented in Section III The incidents were collected along three years in a real power system by the utility from customer service centers or incidents management systems Each incident was documented with the occurring date the main cause 050storm tree component failure etc.\051 and the voltage level 050medium voltage low voltage etc\051 where it was originated In summary there are more than 40 different types of causes and also three voltage levels where used medium voltage 050MV\051 low voltage 050LV\051 and incidents that do not cause interruptions of supply 050ST\051 In Table III a short description of each cause is shown The types 2XX represent incidents caused by atmospheric or environmental in\003uences the types 3XX are used to classify the incidents involving the utility's liability the types 4XX represent incidents caused by third party and the type 900 are incidents of force majeure For the case study the 002ve feeders with the highest number of incidents were selected The incidents occurred in each one of the feeders werel analyzed as single sequences and each incident is represented by the cause the voltage level where it was originated and its corresponding time of occurrence Table IV shows the distribution of the incidents in the 002ve feeders selected

cause of more than 50 of incidents was unknown 050301\051 and they did not originate long interruptions in the power supply 050ST\051 while breakdown of material 050303\051 in the MV network represents less than 7.5 of all incidents For the feeder 1 vandalism 050405\051 is the second most common cause of fault A Selection of parameters To perform the analysis of the sequence of incidents under the focus of frequent episodes the necessary parameters can be subdivided into three types 1\051 Criteria to 002nd frequent episodes  According with Section II the parameters that have to be de\002ned are width of the sliding window the sliding time of the window 050step\051 and the minimum support for frequent episodes The window width de\002nes how close must be the events to form an episode Its value is assigned taking into account the nature of the data and the problem to be solved For example if we want to know what types of incidents occur frequently in a feeder within an interval of one week a width window of one week will be selected In this case previously it should be known that usually the events occur daily On the other hand if the nature of data shows that events occur at intervals of a few seconds the width window should be also in seconds 


5 The sliding time of the window is a parameter that affects the calculation of the support of the episodes To minimize its effect in the calculation of the support it is recommended that its value was expressed in the same units as the width of the window The minumun support represents the minimum percentage of windows in which an episode must be found to be considered a frequent episode The value is de\002ned taking into account the frequency of individual events of interest For example if an event type of interest represent the 5 of events in a sequence then the minimal support should be de\002ned around 0.05 2\051 Criteria to select relevant episodes  According with Section III the parameters that have to be de\002ned are the similarity between the subepisodes support and the similarity between the supports of the serial episode and the parallel episode composed by the same events type The value of these parameters can vary between 0 and 1 being 1 the most restrictive value 050highest similarity\051 It is recommendend start with a value equal to 0.5 3\051 Criteria to 002nd the most likely causal relationships  The parameter that has to be de\002ned is the minimum con\002dence which represents the minimum value of the conditional probability calculated from the supports of an episode and its corresponding subepisode The value of this parameter is set between 0 and 1 For forecasting purposes it is recommend to use values greater than 0.5 The selected parameters in the analysis of the sequences in the case study are the following 1\051 To 002nd frequent episodes 017 Width of time window t w  15 days 017 Sliding time t s  1 day 017 Minimum support  0.03 2\051 To select relevant episodes 017 Similarity between serial support and parallel support  0.7

episodes were obtained by the method exposed in Section II but only few of them are relevants Table V shows these relevant episodes and the values obtained for the the parameter of selection the serial and parallel support symilarity between serial and parallel supports and the similarity between the subepisodes support For the sequence corresponding to feeder 1 is observed that the episodes of length 4 and above are primarily composed by the incident type 301-ST This type of incident occur due to aereal networks are often subject to self-extinguishing faults then it is not observable any causal link from these episodes The episode 304-ST,301-MV,303-MV is composed by incidents of several types Its occurrence is due to the coincidence of these three types of impact at different points

brackets number of successive incidents of the same type along the sequence Since the incident rates found in this episode are rare their joint occurrence probably reveals some order relation between them For the sequence of incidents in feeder 2 it is observed that the relevant episodes are only associated with incidents of type 301-ST This result can be expected since over 70 of the incidents are of this type 050see Table IV\051 For the feeder 3 relevant episodes related with incidents 301-MV 304-ST and 303-MV were found This situation also occur in the feeder 1 For the feeder 4 only one relevant episode was found Unlike the other four sequences no signi\002cant episode related with incident type 301-ST appear which indicates that its occurrence was not uniform along the sequence The episode 301-MV,303-MV relates the incident types 301-MV and 303MV and it has been considered also relevant in the feeders 1 and 3 For the feeder 5 Table V shows that the relevant episodes are related with successive occurrences of the incident type 301-ST as it occurs in the feeder 2 too In summary experimental results revealed the existence of the episode 301-MV,303-MV in three of the 002ve

In brackets number of successive incidents of the same type analysed Their simultaneous occurrence suggests a probable relationship since the incidents that form part of this episode represent only a small percentage of the data In four of the 002ve feeders analysed relevant episodes with different lengths and associated with the incident type 301-ST were found The occurrence of these episodes is mainly due to the high probability of ocurrence of this type of incident In most of the cases this incident occur due to faults with successful reclosing and are caused by external factors 050environmental\051 Therefore it is unlikely to discover if they are related to other types of incidents C Association rules Probables relations of causality called association rules can be obtained from the relevant episodes These association rules may be useful for prediction of future incidents Causality is assessed by calculating the aposteriori probability as it is discussed in Section III Table VI shows the relationships of causality 050association rules\051 with con\002dence greater than 0.6 for the 002ve feeders in the case study In Table VI for the feeder 1 the 002rst rule can be interpreted as follows if in this feeder the incident type 304-ST occurs followed by an incident of type 301-MV 050in an interval of time less than 15 days\051 there is a probability of 67 that an incident of type 303-MV 050material breakdown in the MV network\051 also occurs within a period that not exceed 15 days from the occurrence of the 002rst incident Other rules for this feeder are less relevant because they involve episodes related only with unknown causes 050301-ST\051 or vandalism 050405-MV\051 and indicate that the probability of occurrence of several incidents of this kind in a window of 15 days is quite high For the feeder 2 the rules only give information about the high probability of occurrence of successive incidents by unknown causes 050301-ST\051 within a time interval of 15 days The same situation is reported by the rules found for the feeder 3 and feeder 5 while for the feeder 4 found no causal relationships with con\002dence greater than 60 were found Finally related to the most likely causal relationships between incidents a relation involving incidents of type 304-ST 301-MV and 303-MV were found This case shows that if the incidents 304-ST and 301-ST occur then an incident 303-MV also occurs within the same window with a high level of con\002dence In four of the 002ve feeders the incident 301-ST appears in several causal relationships Their appearance con\002rms the high probability of occurrence of self-extinguished faults V C ONCLUSION In this paper the use of techniques for mining frequent patterns in sequences of events to understand the behaviour of the failures and faults in electric distribution networks is explored It is proposed to use historical information about the incidents collected in the network to extract knowledge oriented to prevent future faults Real incidents associated with abnormal conditions and collected in different feeders arel used to analyse the consistency and bene\002ts of the method to deal with frequent episodes associated with incidents In addition a new method to evaluate the relevance of the frequent serial episodes found in a sequence of events is shown The relevance is evaluated based on set theory and probability calculus This new de\002nition suggests that a serial episode is relevant if the frequency of all of its subepisodes is similar and if the serial support is similar to the support of the parallel episode formed with the same events Therefore not all frequent episodes found in a sequence of events are relevant The proposed de\002nition is applicable to the analysis of frequent episodes in any data sequence but it is especially useful to recognize outstanding episodes in sequences that have high randomness which is the case of sequences of incidents in electrical networks A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research has been developed within the eXiT Control Engineering and Intelligent Systems research group of the Institute of Informatics and Applications 050University of

and keeps itemsets consist of both rare items and high frequent items. If all the items in a new candidate set are in the same group, then it is selected as a valid candidate, otherwise the new candidate is not added to valid candidate itemsets Here for each group there are different support and confidence. Each candidate itemset belongs to a particular group. After finding group id of a candidate itemset, the algorithm uses corresponding support for candidate selection where as Apriori uses a single support threshold for all the candidate itemsets. By this way, itemsets are explored which are desired   to medical researchers 3.2. Generating association rules Let AC\(item of three  values: 1 if item   is constrained to be  in the antecedent of a rule, 2 if it  is constrained to be  in the consequent and 0 if it can be in either. Using this function, itemset is partitioned into antecedent set consequent set and both set. Moreover, it does not use subset generation to itemsets to form rules like conventional association mining algorithm; it only uses subset generation to both set. Each subset of both set is added in antecedent part in one rule and is added in consequent part in another rule. Each itemset belongs to a particular group. In addition to there is a different confidence for each group whereas Apriori uses a single confidence for all the itemsets. After finding group id of an itemset, the algorithm uses corresponding confidence to form rules. By this way, rules are explored which are desired of medical researchers 83 Algorithm:  Find itemsets which has high support and are in the same group Input: Data and metadata files Output :  Itemsets which are desired to Medical Researchers 1.

Results and discussion The experiments were done using PC with core 2 duo processor with a clock rate of 1.8 GHz and 3GB of main memory. The operating system was Microsoft Vista and implementation language was c#.  We used 1 dataset to verify our method. The data set of interest is patient dataset collected and preprocessed from Bangladeshi hospitals, which has 50273 instances and 514 attributes \(included 150 discrete and 364 numerical attributes categories of healthcare data: ratio, interval, decimal integer, percentage etc. All these data are converted into mineable items \(integer representation domain dictionary and rule base.

The maximum number of items in a rule  was 6.  125 desired itemsets were generated in total. 21 rules were discovered in total. It took about 3461 seconds to find these rules. Third column of the table presents the test result, where we used 8 groups, minimum support of 35%-94% and correlation of .63-.91 to mine symmetric association rules for medical researcher.

constrains on attributes constant. Time is not varied significantly because the number of groups has no lead to reduce disk access. This is because number of groups has no lead to the number of candidate generations phases and to the number of support calculation phases. The number of groups has only lead to the number of valid candidate generations and it can save some CPU time Figure 4: Time comparison of the proposed algorithms for the patient dataset based on Group Size Figure 4 shows how time is varied with different group size for medical research algorithm. Here we measured the performance of Medical Research algorithm in terms of group size keeping number of groups constant, support and confidence of each group constant, antecedent and consequent constrains on attributes constant. Time is varied significantly because group size has lead to reduce disk access. This is because group size has   lead to the number of candidate generations phases and to the number of support calculation phases Figure 5: Accuracy of test result for the patient dataset based on correlation Figure 5 illustrates accuracy results for our proposed algorithm. The value of correlation for each presented result is also indicated. For accuracy measurement, we intentionally discovered relationships among attributes for which trends are known. Here we calculated accuracy as the ratio between the number of correct discovered relationships and total number of discovered relationships. A discovered relationship is correct if it is one of the known trends of medical domain. It shows that an average accuracy of 55% is achieved with correlation 0.5. The proposed algorithm with correlation 0.7 achieves an average accuracy of 85.66%. The proposed algorithm with correlation 0.7 achieves an average accuracy of 94.66%. As 0 1000 2000

Conclusion Medical Researchers are interested to find relationship among various diseases, lab tests symptoms, etc. Due to high dimensionality of medical data, conventional association mining algorithms discover a very high number of rules with many attributes, which are tedious, redundant to medical researchers and not among their desired set of attributes. In this paper, we have proposed an association rule mining algorithm for finding symmetric association rules to support medical qualitative research. The main theme of this algorithm is based on the following two statements interesting relationships among various medical attributes are concealed in subsets of the attributes but do not come out on all attributes taken together and all interesting relationships among various medical attributes have not same support and correlation. The algorithm constructs a candidate item sets based on groups constraint and use the corresponding support of each group in candidate selection process to discover all possible desired item sets of that group. We propose measuring interestingness of known symmetric relationships and unknown symmetric relationships via the correlation measure of antecedent items and consequent items. The proposed algorithm has been applied to a real world medical data set. We have shown significant accuracy in the output of the proposed algorithm. Although we have used levelwise search for finding symmetric association rules each step of our algorithm is different from any level-wise search algorithm. Rules generation from desired item sets is also different from conventional association mining algorithms 6. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

the time needed for execution exceeded 100000 seconds Thus, from this analysis we see that FPrep, which uses FCM clustering, clearly outperforms the CLARANS and CURE based methods on the basis of speed. The execution times for CLARANS and CURE mentioned in fig. 7 and Table II do not include the time required to create fuzzy sets, and calculate the membership value  for each numerical data point in every fuzzy set for the numerical attribute under consideration. These times also do not take into account the time required to transform crisp numerical attributes to fuzzy attributes, and derive the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset The fuzzy partitions generated for each of the five numerical attributes for the USCensus1990raw dataset are shown in Table III. Coincidentally, generating three fuzzy partitions for each numerical attribute seemed a perfect fit In addition to the superior speeds achieved by FPrep, as illustrated in fig. 7 and Table II, Table III indicates the semantics and the quality of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. Moreover, the number of frequent itemsets generated by a fuzzy ARM algorithm \(like fuzzy ARMOR and fuzzy Apriori minimum support threshold, is illustrated in fig. 8   Fig. 7. Algorithm, numerical attribute comparison based on speed \(log10 seconds   Fig. 8. Number of frequent itemsets for various minimum support values  B. Results from Second Dataset We have also applied FPrep on the FAM95 dataset http://www.stat.ucla.edu/data/fpp transactions. Of the 23 attributes in the dataset, we have used the first 18, of which six are quantitative and the rest are binary. For each of the six quantitative attributes, we have generated fuzzy partitions using FPrep. A thorough analysis with respect to execution times, has already been performed on the USCensus1990raw dataset \(which is manifolds bigger in size than the FAM95 dataset both on the basis of number of transactions and number of unique values for numerical 


attributes dataset has been done solely to provide further evidence of the quality and semantics of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. The details of the same are in Table IV. In this case, the number of fuzzy partitions is different for different numerical attributes. Thus, the number and type of fuzzy partitions to be generated is totally dependent on the attribute under consideration. A graphical representation of the fuzzy partitions generated for the attribute Age has already been provided in fig. 5, and clearly shows the Gaussian nature of the fuzzy partitions. The nature and shapes of fuzzy partitions for the rest of the attributes are also similar. Last, the number of frequent itemsets generated for different minimum support values is illustrated in fig. 8  C. Analysis of Results With FPrep, we can analyze and zero in on the number and type of partitions required based on the semantics of the numerical attributes, which the methods detailed in [19 20] do not necessarily facilitate. Then, FPrep, backed by FCM clustering, takes care of the creating the fuzzy partitions, especially assigning membership values for each numerical data point in each fuzzy partition. In section 8.A we have already shown that FPrep is nearly 9 to 44 times faster than the CURE-based method, and 2672 to 13005 times faster than the CLARANS-based method. FPrep is not only much faster than other related methods, but also generates very high quality fuzzy partitions \(Table III and IV much user-intervention. We have created a standard way of representing any fuzzy dataset \(converted from any type of crisp dataset efficacy of the same is corroborated by the successful implementation of Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR on the fuzzy dataset \(converted from crisp version of FAM95 dataset an initial implementation of Fuzzy ARMOR, are very encouraging. FPrep, when used in conjunction with these fuzzy ARM algorithms, generates a pretty good number of high-quality frequent itemsets \(fig. 8 frequent itemsets generated for a particular minimum support is same, irrespective of the fuzzy ARM algorithm 


used IX. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have highlighted our methodology, called FPrep, for ARM in a fuzzy scenario. FPrep is meant for seamlessly and holistically transforming a crisp dataset into a fuzzy dataset such that it can drive a subsequent fuzzy ARM process. It does not rely on any non-fuzzy techniques and is thus more straightforward, fast, and consistent. It facilitates user-friendly automation of fuzzy dataset 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Age - 91 Hours - 100 Income3 4949 Income2 13707 Income1 55089 Ti m e lo g1 0 se co nd s Numerical Attribute - Number of Unique Values FCM CURE CLARANS 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500

This methodology involves two distinct steps, namely creation of appropriate fuzzy partitions using fuzzy clustering and creation of fuzzy records, using these partitions, to get the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset FPrep has been compared with other such techniques, and has been found to better on the basis of speed. We also illustrate its efficacy on the basis of quality of fuzzy partitions generated and the number of itemsets mined by a fuzzy ARM algorithm which is preceded by FPrep. This preprocessing technique provides us with a standard method of fuzzy data \(record that it is useful for any kind of fuzzy ARM algorithm irrespective of how the algorithm works. Furthermore, this pre-processing methodology has been adequately tested with two disparate fuzzy ARM algorithms, Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR, and would also work fine with other fuzzy ARM algorithm REFERENCES 1] Zadeh, L.

The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
