subgraphs of G. Two k-edge graphs are joinable if they share a common \(k .1\edge subgraphs. The join operation is expensive, as show n in[9 i n g le  join operation might generate multiple graph candidates and one candidate might be redundantly proposed by multiple distinct join operations On the other hand, an extension operation produce a k +1\edge graph candidate from a frequent k-edge graph G by adding an additional edge to G \(with/without introducing an additional node\[10  T his o p e ratio n is also costly since for a given graph,there are many nodes in the graph that an additional edge might be attached to V F REQUENT SUBGRAPH MINING One of the key challenges f o r ef f i cien t s u bg raph enumeration is the scheme to e.ciently count the support and frequency of a particular subgraph G. A brute force way to do this is to perform subgraph matching and count how many graphs in a graph database are the supergraph of G. This scheme involves a subgraph matching procedure which is known to be NP-complete in the general cas From a practical point of view, the above scheme can be significantly sped up by recording the previous matched vertices \(denoted as an embedding\d basing the subsequent search on the previous recorded information. To further explain this point, we define an embedding as follows Definition 5.1 Given an arbitrary n × n adjacency matrix A and a labeled graph 002\003 l E V G E V     004 004 005 000\017 a vertex list V u u u L n 035 005    2 1 003 is an embedding of A in G iff 1 002\003 002\003 i i i u l a i 005 013   002 2 002\003 002\003 j i j i j i u u l a a j i  0    005 036 034 013 002 where n i j 030 037 037 0  The set of all embeddings of a matrix in a database is defined as its embedding set  To count the frequent is equivalent to count the number of isomorphisms from P to GD  We employ a new data structure tree unit to count the support and frequent of a candidate subgraph P in GD for the sake of the NP-Complete problem of subgraph isomorphism test. The graph unit of a candidate P in GD is a triple 021 037 occlist graphlist clcode where 002\003 P code clcode canonical 005  graphlist is a list of isomorphic subgraphs, and occlist is the corresponding occurrence list of an isomorphic subgraph clcode can be obtained by using CAM graphlist can be obtained by  embedding of P and occlist can be obtained by embedding set for every subgraph in the graphlist  VI E XPERIMENTS AND A NALYSIS A Preprocessing of the primitive data Experiment environment: The computer used is a PC with Intel Core 2 Duo 2.53GHz CPU and 1G main memory, 80GB disk. The program implemented with Java on the platform of JBuilder2006 under Windows XP Data source and preprocessing: FSubgraphM was applied to chemical carcinogenesis analysis which is a challenge topic proposed in IJCAIT h e o b ject i v e  data were obtained from the website of National Toxicology Program\(NTP\ and Oxford University. The database contains information on 337 chemical compounds in two separated files. The first file named atoms.pl contains definitions of atoms in compounds. For example 001\000 atm 002 1 1 1   22 0.133 dd c 032 002Å\001\001 means that a chemical compound 1 d has an atom whose identifier is 1 1 d of element carbon, of type 22 and with partial charge -0.133. The other file bonds.pl provides bonding information between atoms. A line in the file 001\000 12 1,1,1,7 bond d d d 001\001 for instance, states that in the compound 1 d its atoms 1 1 d and 2 1 d are connected by a type 7 bond. There are 4 different types of bonds\( 1,2,3 and 7\om types and 24 different atoms 002 As, Ba, Br, C, Ca, Cl, Cu, F, H, Hg, I, Mn, N, Na O, P, Pb, S, Se, Sn, Te, Ti and Zn 002  For simplicity, we didn’t have consider the information of the atom types, partial charges. For each compound, it’s atoms correspond the vertices in the corresponding graph, and the bonds correspond to the edges. Then we got a database consisting of 337 graphs We  have represent of canonical adjacence matrix for each graph in the graph data sets, then we got 337 CAM The minimal graph with size of 2, and the maximal with size of 214 B Analysis of the result Figure 1 shows the performance of algorithm FsubgraphM applied to carcinogen To certain size graph sets |D|=100, the average n |N|=20, the test running time along with the support change,result in Figure 1 a shows 002 To certain size graph sets |D|=100, support is 15%, the test running time along with the number of nodes change,result in Figure 1 \(b\ shows 002 To certain size graph sets |D|=337 support is 15%, the test running time along with the number of datasize change,result in Figure 1 \(c\ shows 002 To certain size graph sets |D|=337 average nodes |N|=24, the test number of candidate subgraph along with the support change,result in Figure 1 d\ shows 


 C ONCLUSIONS we are propose a nove graph canonical form to determining graph isomorphism and avoid the NPComplete problem of subgraph isomorphism Can efficient enumerated candidate subgraph’s supporty and frequency by maintaining an embedding set. Next, based on the usual frequent subgraph definition, we propose a novel definition of frequent subgraph, and we propose algorithm FSubgraphM which employs the above techniques to mine frequent induced subgraph from a graph data sets There are some drawbacks need more attention in the future research sta t ed abov e w i t h in a g r ou p  of compounds having the same or similar characteristics can di date g r aph  p occurs in compound a frequently, while it doesn’t appear in the other compounds. In case that the frequent of p may equal to or greater than the threshold of frequent but the support is less than the support threshold, so p is not frequent. That is to say p cann’t describe the common characteristic of the compounds, but please note that it occurs frequently in compound a it may describe the personality of compound a  It’s valuable to find the common characteristics from a group of structur but, if we can discovery the personalities from the common characteristics will surprise you indeed A CKNOWLEDGMENT DeQuan Tang and Yang Tan thanks A Project Supported by Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department,China\(Grant No 10C0134 R EFERENCES 1 Q  M e i 9 D.Xin 9 H.Cheng, J.Han, and C.Zhai.

by complier to close declared resources within a try statement This proposal is actually a syntax improvement to developers However ARM can only handle local resources leak within method scope In contrast our approach is able to report missing resource closure within class scope or across classes VI C ONCLUSION In order to improve the pattern universality and detect resource leak before code

mining procedures. Our motivation in this study is to utilize the redundancy for extracting algorithm of fuzzy association rules IV. IMPROVEMENT OF APRIORI ALGORITHM BASED ON If max{Conf\(Z ? y X ? y max{CF\(Z ? y X ? y ZEQ Proof From the assumption, there exist P E Q that satisfY Con/\(P ? y X ? Y P ? y 0: CF\(X ? Y CF\(X ? y P ? Y Z ? V ZEQ 70 The necessary point in the Apriori algorithm for extracting association rules is to generate the frequent item sets efficiently Though the confidence of the association rules are calculated mally after all decision of frequent itemsets in traditional Apriori algorithm, the basic idea of our proposal is that the confidence of the rule can be calculated after each step A3 in the Apriori algorithm and used for pruning the redundant itemsets. The issue is to decide which itemset should be pruned utilizing the confidence information. Then we define "strong redundant rule" and "strong redundant itemset Confidence 1.0 2 3 4 The number of items Figure 2. Conceptual Diagram of Pruning Method Definition 2: Let X ? Y be a fuzzy association rule, where X and Yare fuzzy item sets. Let Q be Q = 2 x - X If min\(ConJ\(Z ?Y X ?Y ZEQ X ? Y strong redundant rule Let k-rule denote the rule that has k attributes\(items consequent part, and the "subset rule" denote that itemset corresponding to the rule is subset of the item set of larger rule and the consequent parts of both rules are the same set Definition 3: Let Z be a fuzzy itemset that has k items\( k>2 When all the k-rules generated from Z are strong redundant, we call the itemset Z strong redundant itemset Fig.2 shows the concept of strong redundant rule and strong redundant itemset. Since the Apriori algorithm generates the candidate itemsets in tum from l-itemsets, the pruning based 


on the redundancy should be performed simultaneously In addition to the basic Apriori algorithm, the following procedures are employed for k> I as A4 confidence of k-rule based on Lk and Lk.j AS The concept of the procedure is that the confidence value of rule should increase by increasing the number of antecedent items. In other words, the procedure is based on valid heuristics that the combination of items in antecedent part which deteriorates the confidence value will become redundant in the following iterations. We can expect reduction of computational time and redundant rules pruning by the additional procedures It should be noted that the confidence calculation in each iteration does not lead to the increase of overall calculation time in association rules mining v. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES We develop the fuzzy mining system based on the redundancy pruning and evaluate the proposed algorithms through numerical examples. We apply the system to "abalone data" available from the vcr Machine Learning Repository[7 The abalone data set consists of 4177 measured data with 1 nominal attribute and 8 continuous attributes as shown in 71 Table. I. In the experiments, the nominal attribute is transformed to the continuous attribute. Table 2\(a statistics and the fuzzy partition information of attributes are summarized in Table 2\(b wider than the actual data distribution for performance evaluation. The fuzzy partition example is shown in Fig.3. We use two types of fuzzy sets with different width, i.e. triangle type and trapezoid type. Although it is better to use the factor such as "interesting" for pruning the derived rules in addition we apply the native association rule extraction for proposed algorithm evaluation.

The number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm Fig.5 shows the results of reduction of itemsets by the proposed algorithm. We can see that fair itemsets are pruned by the proposed method. Fig.6 shows the number of extracted rules by the conventional Apriori algorithm. Many redundant rules are extracted as well as the necessary non-redundant rules Our issue is to restrain the extraction of redundant rules. Fig.7 shows the results of the number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm. Some redundant rules are deleted simultaneously along with frequent itemsets extraction However, since a few non-redundant rules are also unexpectedly deleted at the lower threshold value of minimal confidence, we have to investigate further about heuristics, i.e strong redundant itemsts and relation of threshold values. It should be noted that the number of deleted rules has less dependence on the minimal confidence These results are promising in terms of computational time and redundant rules pruning. However, the improvement is limited in terms of computational time. We consider that the performance of the proposed method must be improved by applying the output field specification method[17]. We expect that the number of pruned rules becomes larger based on the specifications. Moreover, the other measures to prevent redundant rules extraction in fuzzy association rules mining 


could be applied as well as the proposed algorithm VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules extracted. We also proved the redundancy defmition of the rule based on the CF\(certainty factor algorithm was evaluated through numerical experiments using benchmark data, "Abalone". From the results, the method was found to be promising in terms of computational time and redundant rule pruning. Our future plan includes sophistication of the proposed algorithm, application to the huge data mining problem, and further improvement of fuzzy association rules mining REFERENCES I] R.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
