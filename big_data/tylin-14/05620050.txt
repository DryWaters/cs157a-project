20IO International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling \(ICCASM 2010 Association Analysis and Case Study Framework Based on the Name Distinction Bo Wu, Wandong Cai, Yongjun Li Department of Computer Science Northwest Polytechnic University Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710129, China wub087@yahoo.cn Abstract-The research of distinction of name ambiguity in the field of information retrieval could enhance searching effect Therefore, it plays an important role to mine the data of name ambiguity in order to obtain useful knowledge. In this paper we focus on the problem of traditional evaluation and ranking method used in the clustering. Traditional evaluation and ranking method ignores the association among the sub information and simply considers that pieces of sub information are mutual independent. We present an effective data mining method framework based on the case study and association analysis. The method framework is evaluated on the dataset of name ambiguity from the database of CDBLP The dataset includes the information of coauthor name workplace, publication, years and ranking of the author of papers. The experimental results show that one piece of main sub-information assisted by some minors could form a stronger rule very useful for the distinction of name ambiguity. Also some combinations of pieces of minor sub-information could produce a stronger rule. The association rules selected by the experiment could be easily explained and commonsensible Considering the association rules coming from the objective data and data mining method, they are more reliable Keywords-name distinction; case study; associaton anaylsis feature extraction; data mining I. INTRODUCTION Since the web technology becomes popular and universal people retrieve information from various databases conveniently and frequently. However, the increasingly prosperity of web technology also brings us some troubles One serious of them is that different things sometime share the same name which confuses us[I]. For instance, in the database of CDBLP, an academic search database based on the authors, we could hardly distinct the papers coming from different authors with the same name. Having considered the past related work of the name ambiguity research[2], in this 


paper, we will present an effective data mining framework based on the case study and association analysis[3]. The framework aims at discovering new knowledge via the method of case study and association analysis. The framework is also supposed to provide the proof and foundations for name distinction and other clustering field II. RELATED WORK AND PROBLEMS There are some difficulties as followed when we refer to the low accuracy rate and the short of method of name distinction 1. It is hard to distinct the different authors by the similarity of the text since the problem itself is caused by similarity of the text 2. Define the information of coauthor, workplace publication, ranking, and years of a paper as sub-information Although the sub-information such as the coauthor names workplaces, publications and the years are useful to identifY a unique author, these information do not effect alone and it is hard to obtain enough knowledge without some association analysis. The mathematical model of the association is not easy to find 3. Nowadays, the method which mining the clustering rule by the individual main sub-information fail to take into account the influence of other pieces of minor sub information and assumed the sub-information is independent from each other. While this assume may cause the losing of associational information and leads to a relatively low accuracy rate. In fact, some combinations of pieces of minor sub-information often lead to a more reliable rule than each of them does. At the same time, the assistance of some specific kind of pieces of minor sub-information could also strongly enhance the accuracy of clustering made by the main information independently 4. Nowadays, the method of association analysis could only provide us the global optimal rules [2][5][6][7 However, global optimal rules are usually dependent on one or several pieces of main sub-information. Therefore, in this paper, we present our method mining rules in all the local optimal points which aims to overcome the problem that one or several main factors counteract the influence of minor sub-information. We desire to mine the information hided in the minors. For example, the DISTINCT method [1] brought 


by Xiaoxin Yin and the GHOST method [3] brought by Xiaoming Fan used in the distinction of name ambiguity in information retrieval field adopt the main sub-information of coauthor and their connectedness as their foundation of research considering that different people have different circles of friends who tend to be familiar with each other These methods have obtained considerable effects on some situations and have been taken as an application in CDBLP in July 2007, whereas, there are still some shortcomings: it is common for the circles of friends of authors have an unfavorable connectedness and under this condition, an author will be divided; at the same time, according to the theory of six degree[8][9][1O], two different authors possibly have the same coauthor or could be connected within a small number of steps which may lead to inaccurate judgment Since the problems discussed above, the distinction of name 978-1-4244-7237-6/1 0/$26.00 .201 0 IEEE V4-285 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling \(ICCASM 2010 ambiguity in site of CDBLP is not perfect. There are two instances as followed in which one same author is divided to two different authors in error caused by the unfavorable connectedness of their circles of friends.

Journal of Computer-Aided Design & Computer Graphics 2008, 20 \(04 From what we have observed, we can safely draw the conclusion that there are still many associations between the two clusters divided by errors. For instance, in the first example, the authors are both ranked in the behind in the author list and at the same time, the two clusters have exactly the same publication; in the second example, the same author published her paper at the same publication at the same year This special characters appeared in the above two examples among the sub-information are not coincidences through the analysis based on amount of data, searching information on the internet and sending email to the authors themselves. In fact, all the characters could reflect some universal meanings Although, the connectedness of author's collaborating circles are weaken by the behaviors such as changes of workplaces or holding two or more positions at different workplaces there are still some inherent characteristics could be reflected 


from the aSSOCiatIOns of information like ranking publications, years and so on. Therefore, this paper is supposed to use the method of association analysis, statistics and AI to obtain some valuable association rules which could contribute to the more accurate names distinction system and the decrease of probability of dividing names by errors III. FRAMWORK OF ASSOCIA nON ANALYSIS AND CASE STUDY A. CASE STUDY MODEL Based on the analysis above, the information provided by information retrieval system and the related work, we choose 5 pieces of information \(coauthor, workplace of the author publication, year, and ranking analysis. Then, according to the statistics theory, we take the measurement of case study to learn the various associations among information and importance of each candidate rule At last, we select several most important association rules The procedure of study of association rules are shown as fig 1. The details are described as followed Figure 1. Studying flow path of association rules B. FREQUENT ITEM SET GENERATION 1 database as the analysis source. CDBLP database is an academic search system in Chinese. We sample 30 groups of papers which are nearly 150 pieces of papers as initial data One of the problem need to be solved is that how to make sure whether two papers with the same name belong to the same author or not. The author's name is under distinction is eliminated from the initial data since it could not provide any useful information to the name distinction. Therefore the cases which two papers have different names of different authors are equal with the case which two papers have same names of different authors. The truth of the initial data is investigated by email, phone and internet in order for us to study 2 sample space randomly. Then compare their sub-information For example, whether the two papers are belong to the same author; whether the two papers have same coauthor; whether they have same workplace; whether they have same publication; whether the ranking of author are the same. We take binary encoding method for convenience. Use symbol 1 


to denote they have same sub-information and use symbol 0 to denote they have different sub-information. Define a V4-286 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling \(ICCASM 2010 string combined by 0 and 1 as a piece of association rule and its according value under decimal system as the characteristic value of the association rule.

RULE GENERATION 


During the period of mining rules, we need a kind of evaluation algorithm to determine which rules should be selected. Posterior probability is an apparent criterion since it could reflect the probability of a correct name distinction However, posterior probability fails to take into account the fraction of coverage. For example, there are two candidate rules as followed[II r1: cover 50 positive cases and 5 negative cases r2 cover 2 positive cases and 0 negative cases In the example, the positive case represents that two papers have same author and negative case represents that V4-287 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling \(lCCASM 2010 two papers have different authors. Posterior probability of rl is 90.91% and posterior probability of r2 is 100%. Although posterior probability of r1 is lower than posterior probability of r2, the fraction of coverage of rl is much better than r2 and the fraction of coverage of r2 is too low to be considered as a valuable rule Moreover, there is another problem of glossing the minor information by main information if we only mining rules based on posterior probability alone Therefore, we could establish a function y=j\(x x E I I 0 ? x ? 31} . Y denotes posterior probability of a rule. x denotes the characteristic value of a rule. There are two steps of mining rules. The first step could ensure the basic correctness and the second step could ensure the basic fraction of coverage Calculate all of the local maximum points Select the rules with best fraction of coverage nearby the local maximum points as association rules. There is the evaluation method as followed R = num _lap x P \(3 num _lap denotes the number of positive cases the rule covered. P denotes the posterior probability. Select the rule with largest R value as the association rule at its local maximum point IV. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS According to the mathematical model and samples, we obtain the posterior probabilities of each rule as fig 2 and table 1 According to the posterior probability of each rules and 


the method above, we could work out the following candidate rules which are naturally divided into 4 probability intervals at totally different orders of magnitude. The first probability interval is [0.879, 1]. When the characteristic value is between 16?31, the probability could reach the local maximum 1. The second probability interval is [0.772 0.968]. When the characteristic value is 10, the probability could reach the local maximum 0.968. The third probability interval is [0.014, 0.045]. When the characteristic value is 5 the probability could reach the local maximum. The fourth probability interval is [0.007, 0.012]. When the characteristic value is 1, the probability could reach the local maximum 0.012 There are the 4 characters as followed The candidate rules are distributed on 4 probability intervals at totally different orders of magnitude The candidate rules in the same interval share one same sub-information. For example, the same sub information in the first interval is coauthor; the same sub-information in the second interval is workplace. The public sub-information in an interval could determine the order of magnitude of an interval. We call this sub-information in an interval as leading information and other information as auxiliary information Normally, with the assistance of auxiliary information, leading information could perform better and generate a local optimal probability. For example, in the second interval, candidate rule with characteristic value 10 have a higher probability than synthetic rule with characteristic value 8 There are some associations which could decrease the probability to the local minimum value. For example, candidate rules with characteristic value 5 and 6 have higher probabilities than candidate rule with characteristic value 7 Finally, we obtain five associatIOn rules with characteristic value 16, 10, 6 and l The association rule with characteristic value 16 could prove that two papers have an extremely high probability to be written by one author if they have same coauthor and the probability in the cases we already known is 1 since it is 


common that an author normally collaborate with some certain people and have the same coauthor 10  1   0 0.1 0 0.01   0.001 0 4 12 16 20 24 28 Characteristic Value Figure 2. Studying result Under the condition that two papers have different coauthors, two papers which share same workplace and same years still have a very high probability to be written by one author. The probability in the cases we already known is 0.958 since one author is likely to publish his paper in the name of a same workplace and the information of the same years increases the posterior probability at the same time The association rule with characteristic value 6 could prove that two papers have a high probability to be written by one author if they have same publication and years under the condition that two papers have different coauthors and workplaces since it is common that an author normally has a certain research direction and level at the same years Although the association rule with characteristic value 1 has been selected, we discard this rule considering it overlaps too few cases and lacks testifY by mass of data The association rules selected by the experiment could be easily explained and commonsensible. Considering the association rules coming from the objective data and data mining method, they are more reliable V4-288 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling \(ICCASM 2010 V. CONCLUSIONS It is a normal method used by the related work in the past 


that selecting useful clustering characters based on the rules of the observable world. However, this method has a problem of scarcity of information and lack of testifY. This paper aims to establish an association analysis model based on case study and then discover new knowledge from limited information. This paper is supposed to contribute to the name distinction and some other clustering analysis with more reliable method and theory We obtain the association rules by the experiment as followed: having same coauthor; having same workplace and years; having same publication and years The association rules selected by the experiment could be easily explained and commonsensible. Considering the association rules coming from the objective data and data mining method, they are more reliable Our future research will focus on the negative correlation between information [12] that is the local minimum points of function y=f\(x method into the feature extraction of pattern recognitions which have relative sub-information ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported partly by the Special Fund for Fast Sharing of Science Paper in Net Era by CSTD under Grant No. 20096102410001 REFERENCES I] X.Yin, JHan, P.S Yu.

The association rules are as shown in table 5. The similarities  between the path of e-shopper CID016  and the derived rules are 22016 =SD and 11016 =SD . Therefore, e-shopper CID016 belongs to the ninth cluster at timeT , since the fitness between CID016 and the rules are =FD2016 0.2 and =FD 1 016 0.2001. Therefore, we predict that the products which e-shopper CID016 is likely to buy are Bread, and Biscuit  TABLE V.

In this study, we describe a new approach for mining the changes of e-shopper  purchase behavior over time and discuss solutions to several problems. For predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior, the following concepts are proposed: BP j SDij and FDij . The SOM technique is used to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. The purchase sequences are derived from the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper. The sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. Then the sequential purchase patterns are stored in the rule database Finally, we give the example to elaborate the new methodology. The research presented in this paper makes a 155 contribution to mining  e-shoppers purchase behavior basing on transaction data. E-retailer may be able to perform effective  one-to-one marketing campaigns by providing individual target e-shoppers with personalized Product basing on using purchase sequences In the future, some possible extensions to this work are as 


follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
