I INTRODUCTION ecently sensor network for configuring intelligent spaces has been actively studied  T h ere a re v a riou s s en s o rs  such as laser range sensors and cameras installed in the environments or mobile sensors with human in intelligent spaces Especially in order to support activities and understand behaviors based on movements of human in the environments various methods to track the position of human have been proposed Existing studies can be classified into three types according to properties of sensors 1 Vision sensor 3 System with vision sensors can provide not only human position but also appearance and motion of human However they are lacking robustness because false detections frequently 
occur due to change in lighting conditions or occlusions by obstacles in the environment 2 Laser range finders LRF LRFs have higher reliability and less noise signal because they are not affected by conditions in the environments However scan data obtained from laser range scanner cannot get personal identification Therefore when tracking multiple people ambiguity occurs in identifying targets 3 Portable sensors  Recently small devices such as ID tags acceleration sensors or other sensors have been developed and they are often installed in mobile phones Then humans can easily carry such sensors ID information can be easily associated to human based on 
information from mobile sensors They are effective to ensure individual identification However position estimation with these mobile sensors is not accurate In order to accurate position estimation with only mobile sensors humans have to wear various kinds of sensors  There are several studies as the solutions for obtaining human ID information and accurate positions simultaneously Literature 6 s h o w s th at ID in f o rm atio n c a b e o b tain ed an d human positions can be estimated accurately by integrating touch sensors or pressure sensors installed on the floor and acceleration sensors Literature  s h ow s p ers o n t rack in g a n d identification based on similarities between angular velocities obtained from gyro sensor with human and estimated by LRFs 
installed in the environment In the literature  acceleration sensors and cameras installed in the environment are integrated Correlation between movement of human extracted in images captured from vision sensors and acceleration signals from acceleration sensor with human are calculated This study introduces a method to accurately achieve human position estimation and identification based on LRF installed in the environment and an acceleration sensor that human is carrying Fig.1 shows a concept of this study Especially improvement of person identification rules and similarity caluculation with optimal parameters are described in this paper In the proposed method occurrences of walking behaviors in LRF and acceleration sensor are evaluated The 
parameters used for evaluation should be optimal for target association between two types of sensors In this paper Improvement of Person Identification Rules Based on Walking Behavior Association between Wearable Acceleration Sensors and Intelligent Space Tomoyasu Takigawa Kazuyuki Morioka Dept of Electrical Engineering School of Science and Technology Meiji University Kawasaki Kanagawa 214-8571 Japan Email ce01052@meiji.ac.jp morioka@isc.meiji.ac.jp R

optimal parameters are derived from actual tracking results Then as for the experiments using the optimal parameter and improved identification rules similaritiy changes and target recognition results are shown II TRACKING BASED ON FUSION OF NETWORKED LASER RANGE SCANNER AND ACCELERATION SENSOR In this study human walking behaviors are detected in networked laser range scanners in the intelligent space and an acceleration sensor with human respectively Walking behaviors of two types of sensors are associated according to steps of walking 2.1 Walking detection using laser range scanners First moving objects are extracted by networked laser range sensors installed in the intelligent space calculating difference between current range data and background range data Then the position information of only moving objects are detected Second hierarchical clustering is applied to the extracted range data After that each moving object can be separated and tracked Fig.2 shows detection and tracking of the human with two legs If movements of detected human are bigger than threshold amount during a given period the human is detected as walking Details of detecting and tracking human are shown in  2.2 Walking detection using am acceleration sensor First the two low-pass filter LPF cut-off frequency 0.5Hz cut-off frequency 10Hz are applied to raw acceleration signals LPF of 10Hz cut-off is used to eliminate the noise In addition DC components are obtained by LPF of 0.5Hz cut-off DC components are treated as gravitational acceleration components Fig.3 shows a vertical direction and a forward direction used for analysis of walking motion If specific changes were appeared in the measured acceleration data that motion is detected as walking Details of this walking detection is described in  2.2.1 Estimation of vertical acceleration To obtain the vertical acceleration it is necessary to remove gravitational acceleration vector from raw acceleration vector In addition it is also essential to obtain the attitude of the acceleration sensor attached to the waist of the human In this case attitude means orientations of the acceleration sensor to the ground and the forward direction along human walking In this study the vertical acceleration is estimated from inner product between unit gravitational acceleration vector based on DC components and acceleration vector that the noise is eliminated 2.2.2 Estimation of forward acceleration In the acceleration sensor attached to the waist the relative heading to the forward direction of the human is unknown It is necessary to calibrate in order to decide forward direction after the sensor is attached to human In order to estimate forward acceleration accelerations of tw o directions on the horizontal plane which is perpendicular to gravity direction are calculated at first The acceleration components on this horizontal plane are calculated in each sampling time The accelerations are saved while several seconds Second the principle axis is calculated by applying principal component analysis to acceleration distribution Then the inner product between the principle axis and the acceleration components of two directions on the horizontal plane is calculated The answer is A fter a given period  Fig.2 Human tracking and walking detection by lase r sensors Fig.3 Axis definition of vertical direction and forwa r d directio n Fi g 4 Acceleration chan g einonec y cle walkin g 219 SI International 2011 


treated as the acceleration of the forward direction This calibration was carried out using acceleration data while 900 times at the beginning of walking 2.2.3 Estimation of walking a unit period Fig.4 shows the typical pattern of acceleration change in the forward direction and the vertical direction for the walking motion on a flat floor This shows one cycle of walking motion In this case we focus on when top and bottom peaks are appeared in each acceleration Literature i n t rodu ces th at th e bottom peak comes next to the top peek in the vertical acceleration and the top peak comes next to the bottom peek in the forward acceleration In one cycle of walking peaks of accelerations appear in order of the top peak in vertical bottom peak in forward bottom peak in vertical and top peak in forward When these peaks are detected the human carrying an acceleration sensor is walking However this traditional method cannot detect walking as shown in Fig.5 w h en acceleration p eak s a re j u m b led as shown in Fig.5 b e ve n t ho ugh t h e hum a n w i th se nso r i s walking We review the conditions for detecting as walking based on comparison between accelerations in walking behavior and in non-walking behavior Fig.6 shows acceleration changes in two behaviors of stand up and sit down As for the location of the peak in each acceleration they are completely different walking behavior shown in Fig.4 Therefore conditions for detecting walking in the traditional method can be relaxed as follows When top peak in forward bottom peak in forward and bottom peak in vertical are placed between sequential top peaks in vertical appear within a given time the motion is treated as walking in the relaxed conditions When the human with the acceleration sensor performed non-walking behavior including stand up and sit down most of motions were not detected as walking 2.2.4Estimation of stopping behavior The proposed method also needs recognition of stopping for behavior based matching between laser scanners and acceleration sensor In this work the system decides as stopping behavior in acceleration sensor if walking behaviors are not detected for three second after the last walking detection 2.3 Matching based on walking behaviors Fig.7 shows a flow chart of associating the target person by two types of sensors Walking behaviors are detected by networked laser range scanners installed in the intelligent space and the acceleration sensor with person In this study we focus on the occurrence and duration of walking and stopping In the matching process association between behavior detectons by laser range scanners and the acceleration sensor are performed The matching process evaluates whether walking behaviors at the same time are detected A similarity of behaviors between two types of sensors is introduced to  a  Result of w alkin g  A ppearan ce of acceleration c h a n g e from 12 to 14 seconds  Table.1 Rules of changing l ij Acceleration sensor i Laser scanner j Rule Walking Walking l i j l i j a Stopping Walking l i j l i j b*f Stopping Stopping l i j l i j c Walking Stopping l i j l i j  d*f  a  Acceleration chan g e in stand u p  b ehavio r  b  Acceleration chan g e sit dow n  b ehavio r Fig.6 Acceleration change in no n walking behavio r Fig.5 Walking and acceleration change in a certain walking 220 SI International 2011 


evaluate matching A similarity s ij is calculated with Eq.\(1 to each combination of detections by acceleration sensor i and laser scanner j  l ij changes based on behavior detections If walking or Stopping is detected at the same time with both sensors l ij increases On the other hand when different behaviors are detected in both sensors l ij decreases Then a similarity also increases with same behavior and decreases with different behaviors from both sensors  exp 1  1 1 ij ij l S 1 Although walking detections with both sensors are not perfect this calculation can keep high similarity between both detections of a target person The rules of changing l ij are shown in Table.1 Similarity calculation and identification performance depend on four parameters a b c and d These parameters should be determined according to optimizing identification performance In this study optimal values of these parameters are determined by evaluating similarities to many walking patterns actually obtained by an experimental system described in Section III Details of optimization method are also described in Section III In the mis-matching between walking detections subtraction amount of l is also affected according to the number of difference f value The person who has the acceleration sensor can be identified from several candidate persons tracked by networked laser range scanners according to the similarity III EXPERIMENT 3.1 Experimental environment Laser range scanners Hokuyo Electric Machinery URG-04LX are set at the height of about 25cm on a smooth floor The target person wears the sensor ATR-Promotions WAA-006 with gyro of three axes and acceleration of three axes on the waist Components including the interface with each sensor and processing of walking detection are developed in each sensor by using the Open Robot Technology Middleware RT Middleware of AIST[10  D etected resu lts of walking are communicated between components 3.2 Calculation of the optimal parameters 10 data sets of walking behaviors were acquired for parameter optimization using the above experimental setup Patterns of these data sets include similar combination of walking and stopping Optimal parameters as the values of evaluation function Eq.\(2 are maximized are searched with the obtained data sets This evaluation function is designed as the similarity of the target person is high and similarities of the other 9 persons are low N i N j i j ij ii S N S E 1 1  2 The similarity of each non-target person S ij is subtracted from the similarity of a target person S ii  N is number of non-target persons and used for weighting a similarity of the target person S ii in the evaluation function In the case that maximum E value is acquired the parameters are regarded as the optimal parameters All 10 persons performed the similar behavior including three sets of walking 60 seconds and stopping 30 seconds Total is 270 seconds As a result the optimal parameters calculated as Eq.\(2 is maximized are shown in Table 2 Experiments to identify each target from 10 candidates are performed The comparison examples with conventional parameters and the optimal parameters are shown in Fig.8 Fig.8 a sho w s c ha nge o f si m i la r i ti e s o f a t a r ge t p e r so n a nd t h e other 9 non-target persons using conventional parameters Fig.8 b sho w s c ha nge o f si m i la r i ti e s o f a t a r ge t p e r so n a nd 9 non-target persons using optimal parameters In the case of conventional parameters it was not able to identify a target person from 10 persons However in the case of optimal parameters the target person is able to be identified from 10 persons after around 250 seconds These results show parameters affect identification performance Optimal parameters with the other evaluation functions and tracking Fig.7 Flow chart 221 SI International 2011

level after around 120 sec As shown in Fig.11 one of non-target persons performs a similar walking pattern compared with the target person Pattern 03 In this figure the similarities of Pattern 01 04 and 05 were suppressed smaller than the similarities of Pattern 02 and 03 after around 60 sec Although it took more time to distinguish Pattern 03 with Pattern 02 than the other patterns the highest similarity was obtained after around 200 sec In Fig.9 as for change of parameters there are little influences in person identification However in Fig.11 since the values subtracted in behavior mismatching parameter b and d increased similarity of the target person does not approach 1 after 220 second In this case since similarity of the target person is still higher than similarity of the other persons target identification is achieved These results introduce the association based on behaviors focused in this study has a possibility to identify a specific person from several persons and track him in high accuracy with laser range sensors in the intelligent space 3.4 Discussion Experiments on identification of the target human with the acceleration sensor were performed in our previous paper Target person and non-target person performed several walking or stop behaviors as same as experiments in this paper Rules of similarity calculation in this paper can identity the target person if completely different behaviors are measured It takes shorter time to obtain the highest similarity with this method than the previous rules The proposed rules can identify the person more correctly than the previous rules even if similar petterns were measured IV CONCLUSION This study aimed to identify a specific person with the accurate position measurements by integrating the networked laser range scanners installed in the intelligent space and an acceleration sensor with the person This paper proposed the identification of a person based on associating the detections of walking behaviors from both sensors Some experimental results showed the feasibility of the method and improvement of performance based on change of parameters Improvement in accuracy of the decision of behavior in each sensor and how to evaluate the similarity should be reconsidered in order to improve the performance as the future work Experiments to identify the target from many persons should be performed REFEERENCE 1 J oo-Ho Lee Hideki Hashimoto Intelligent Space  concept and contents Advanced Robotics Vol.16 No.3 pp.265-280 2002  K az uy uki M o r io ka J o o H o L e e  H i de ki H a s h

 Test cases Support t1,t2,t3,t5 1   Confidence = \( \( X U Y X * count   From the above calculation the t1,t2 of the test cases covers maximum coverage of the requirements of a program  5.THE EXPERIMENT  5.1.Implementation Details  Our experiment is performed on a PC with an INTEL Core 2 Duo  CPU 2.26GHz and 1GB memory. All the studied test suite reduction techniques are implemented on this PC by a single software engineer using C Languauage and all the executables run on Windows Vista Home Professional .Heuristic Greedy  and heuristic  Random  are simply implemented as C programs  5.2 Subject Programs and test cases  In our Experiment we tested 3 small C Programs these programs results  are shown in the table 2.We considered statement coverage as the primary requirement .To obtain the statement coverage adequate test suites for each program,we tested the triangle program for study .This program basically accepts three positive integer value as input.from users and determines whether it is a valid triangle or not.Finally on the basis of this input it displays corresponding messages as follows A triangle having  three sides are equal Equilateral Triangle A triangle of  any two sides are equal Isosceles Triangle A triangle having three sides of different lengths Scalene triangle  


totally fourteen test cases are developed using whitebox technique for validation purpose, from these experiemts t2,t3,t5} achieves a maximum coverage of test cases.similarly for other program also  4.3 Experiemental Procedure  In our experiment we use a coverage criterion as statement coverage .As there are usually some none executable statements in a program and some executable statements may not be covered by any used test cases, the number of requirements for each program is typically smaller than its number of lines of code  4.4.

  Table 2.Results of maximum coverage of test cases  4.6. Experimental Results  From the experiment shows that the algorithm  proves maximum coverage of test cases based upon the requirements  5.CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  On the basis of analyzing the maximum coverage of test cases,we applied the Association rules for finding correlation/Strong realtion between test cases and requirements,coverage criteria is the requirements used here.The Association Mining can gives better result for the maximum coverage of the test cases. In order to determine the coverage we gave the support count as manually.From the above experiment we can conclude that the association rule mining approach will shows the optimize  with smaller test case itself.We would like to runs similar experiments on programs from a broader  range of programming languages,sizes and problem domains ,in order to capture how large programs can quickly lead to maximum coverage. Coverage analysis makes the test cycle more efficient       ICCCCT10 809 REFERENCES  1]  Boris Beizer,Software Testing Technique, Second Edition International Thomson Computer 1990 ISBN 1-85032-880-3  2] Cornelia Gy?rdi, Robert Gy?rdi, prof. dr. ing.

In order to notice the differences, all grayed cells are pruned thanks to the RSA education wage [6;7] [8;9] [10;13] [14;18 2.85; 4.70] 3 4 15 -22 4.75; 7.14] 1 3 8 -12 7.30; 12.67] -2 -3 1 5 13.00; 26.29] -1 -4 -25 30 TABLE VII ENHANCED CONTINGENCY TABLE OF VARIATIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATION \(EDUCATION-WAGE This table is the starting point of the consolidation process described below 39 


V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables
