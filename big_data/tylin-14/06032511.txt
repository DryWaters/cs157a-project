calculating the weight for each web page for respective web site. The proposed approach uses Visiting Frequency and Time Spent on a Web page as two parameters to measure the weight of each web page To estimate the performance of the proposed two algorithms i.e. FPW and FTPW, discussed in section IV based on the above parameters involved in estimation C. Experimental Results The performance of the proposed approach can be evaluated by comparing the performance of FPW and FTPW algorithms which differ in number of parameters considered for experimentation. The comparison is made by taking the attribute like Visiting Frequency in FPW, and further Visiting Frequency and Time spent on a web page are clubbed together in FTPW as another attribute. The experimental setup uses five users and weights are plotted against various parameters Figure 2 shows the plot of Visiting Frequency v/s Weight of a web page              Figure 2: Plot between frequency and weight Algorithm: FTPW Input: Web traversal path database Output: Weight for each page 1 Calculate PageRank for each page \(PRi 3 2 Initially Set W\(Pi 3 Check the user is registered or not, if YES then 4       whether the user is first time visitor, if YES then 5  return W\(Pi 6    else 7      calculate FW\(Pi 4

CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK 


 Web Usage Mining have been used in improving Web site design and marketing decision support, user profiling, and Web server system performance. Web page prediction technique is a very important role in web technologies. This paper proposes efficient algorithms for web path recommendation based on Weighted Association Rule. Two factors frequency and time spent were used to decide the web path traversal. The experimental results show that in the proposed approach when we increase the number of parameters for finding the web path the accuracy of the system is enhanced drastically and FTPW produces more accurate results than those achieved by FPW In the future, we shall improve the Web Path Traversal by considering the parameter Data Transfer Rate to provide the accurate Web Path traversal REFERENCES 1] M.
