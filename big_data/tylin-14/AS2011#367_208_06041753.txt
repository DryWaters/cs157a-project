Mining of Association Model Pair in Multidimensional Structured Database Luo Mingying University of Electronic Science and Technology of China School of Computer Science and Engineering Chengdu, China Library Xichang College Xichang, China Abstract In the paper we first propose a user preference model with the minimum support intelligent set method Secondly, we propose a new data mining problem, the structure of the database to find frequent patterns associated pair. To effectively address these problems, we developed a series of cutting ability with a strong algorithm. The new algorithm is also discussed in the one-dimensional and multi-dimensional structure of the database found on the applicability of the model 
and to assess the efficiency of the new algorithm Index Terms -Association Rules; Multidimensional Structured Database; Mining I I NTRODUCTION For Mining Association Rules Apriori algorithm for frequent item sets first proposed by Agrawal and Srikant [1   It is a very influential algorithm is based on the nature of frequent itemset is also frequent non-empty set." A frequent itemset is depending on the user specified minimum support Overall, the association mining to meet the minimum support to first find the frequent itemsets, and then those who meet the minimum confidence based on frequent item sets derived association rules. The problem is the minimum support and 
minimum confidence set no clear standards. Setting different minimum support will find a different number of frequent itemsets, which affects the rules to be excavated. Fayyad et al 2 d e scrib ed  th e data m i n i ng i n o r d er to  r e p eat  th e s earch  process, it implies that the efficiency of mining process most appropriate setting depends on mining query, this set contains the minimum support and confidence setting When the association rule mining was first introduced, it only focused on the discovery product purchase analysis of the association between dimensions. Later, in [3 th e pr o p o s ed  multi-dimensional data from a data warehouse cube or 
multidimensional association mining. Allows for multiple dimensions, and through the optional filter set of data granularity, the user can specify more precise objectives mining data. Therefore, multidimensional association mining query is automatic, the rules were excavated close to the user want. However, for inexperienced users, to construct an effective query is difficult, especially in the setting appropriate threshold values User preference model to maintain logs extracted from the excavation are frequently used queries. It describes a variety of users to mine the experience, thereby providing useful information for the users benefit users, especially beneficial to 
inexperienced users. With the model of user preferences specified in the query and the similarity between the user's query terms, identifying the most similar to the intensity of mining user queries. Queries from those calculated from the threshold of support, export the appropriate minimum support and provide to the user Recently, in many applications, structured data is becoming increasingly common. Structured data through these interrelated or integrated, we will have easy access to more informative and valuable but complex structured data. As such a typical example of complex databases, we are concerned about the structure of multi-dimensional data, ie, attribute value 
table with the attributes for structured data [4   Multi-dimensional structure of the database from the situation in the mining, the discovery of knowledge between attributes is an important concern is also significant. For example, on multi-dimensional structure of proteins in the database, if the amino acid and protein structures found some cause for concern among the links, then it may give us some of the amino acid sequence to maintain a useful mechanism for knowl   Driven by these backgrounds, in this paper, we investigate to find among the different attributes associated structural model of the problem. Search through the form on the 
association model, we expect to get the structure of the traditional architecture of data mining can not be precisely the new discovery and understanding, as a model in one of the alternative model presented many of the other perspective or comment II SMART SET SUPPORT THRESHOLD METHOD BASED ON USER PREFERENCE MODEL From the association rule mining was first Agrawal et al [6  introduced the beginning, a number of scholars dedicated to research on it [7   I n th eir p r o p o s a l  th e n eed to sp eci f y t h e user's minimum support to the pattern recognized as interest Other studies on the measurement of interest was carried out

We provide users with appropriate support threshold value is present in the user preference model by the additional knowledge of mining it from the previous experience of the user to collect information A Multidimensional Association Mining A multi-dimensional association rules is an involving one or more dimensions \(attributes\ of the association rules.

Upon receiving a user-defined queries submitted, the mining engine's function is triggered. When the user receives the data mining results, he or she subjectively determine whether these results are acceptable. If the answer is no, then will adjust the mining query, run the mining process again until the user get an acceptable result B User Preference Model In the proposed architecture, for each user by the various users, especially experienced by the successful completion of the mining process, we assume that the mining query is recorded in the mining log. That they can not dig too monotonous log in our proposed mechanism to be used. In trying to specify the user with the user preference model similar to retrieve query will increase the computational cost Thus, the log from the typical mining queries purification is necessary. Mining user preference model consists of a log to be representative of frequently used queries. Purification process involves the query the following steps 1\ Identify the query pattern of the format  GM tt 007 of partial rules, it noted G t and M t to tend to be in specific thresholds 2\ together the related query pattern in step 1, derived an alternative query mode 3\ to step 2 alternative query mode to find the partial log from the mining rules format "where" attribute model. This indicates that the threshold in a particular case, the alternative query mode and "where" conditions of the property may be used together 4\ to step 3, those with the excavation log "where property model "where" conditions together, export substitution "where" condition 5\ will replace the query pattern and alternative "where conditions, the combination generates an alternative query 6\ by solving related to the query with alternative initial query to calculate the average of alternative query minimum support and minimum confidence The rules found by the alternative query will include those covered by the alternative query query the discovered rules Shown in Figure 1, alternative queries are constructed and stored in the user preference model. By connecting to the corresponding property and the property index and provide to the rapid entrance. Query is expressed as an alternative model of user preferences in a path. User preference model is constructed in the hierarchy. It collects the relative who has been frequently used in the previous alternative query. When mining the log increased to more than a particular threshold the user preference model will be automatically reconstructed III THE SMART SET STRUCTURE OF M INIMUM SUPPORT This section provides minimum support for the mechanism of the smart set. First, we introduce the mining system architecture, and second, to provide minimum support set for the details of the mechanism A Smart Set Architecture Successful query is kept in the mining log.

It calculates the specified user queries and user preferences model similarity between alternative query, to provide users with a reasonable degree of support range setting               Fig.1 The intelligent suggestion framework B Set the minimum support We set the minimum support a reasonable range of strategy is from the user preference model \(including the wisdom of experienced users\to extract empirical values. In order to get from the user preference model appropriate minimum support range, the similarity between the two query detection is essential. In particular, constructed by the user, and / or user preference model will be compared with the query to detect similarities. , And the matching degree calculated in different ways, respectively, and then sum them to obtain the degree of similarity queries. Then, for the user's range of minimum support structure from the user query, and / or similar query the top export items. Calculation details are described below So a G constructed for the user b G is the model from the user preferences. Assumptions And represent the properties and the domain base, where.

The purpose of this problem is to find all item sets and contains a sequence of frequent \(closed\ mode. In [11 o p o s ed a "r elat ed g rap h i cs search" problem, it is about the relationship in the graph database mining. The structure and our algorithms are very different, because it considers relevant to a given query subgraph. Carried out in the graphics database is another problem associated with minin g mining HSG [9 problem, the use of all - trust as associated measurement [12  all the associated sub-Atlas will be found. However, it did not discuss the mode between the mining property Utilization - the correlation coefficient as the correlation test [13 we f i rst co ns i d er th e two d im en sion al stru ctur e o f th e database on the problem of mining association patterns. To effectively solve this problem, developed an algorithm called nCP. By running on a tree data structure, and use - the correlation coefficient of the boundary and joint support of the lower boundary, nCP algorithm can avoid no future for consideration. Also studied two types of top-k mining problem based on nCP algorithm developed several algorithms for these problems. In addition, we will explore the development to the more general case, that is, not only in the one-dimensional structure of the database mining association pair, also with two or more attributes of the multi-dimensional structure of the database mining association pair  B nCP Algorithm Solve the frequent association model \(FCPP\e problem of mining algorithms nCP. In the figure, representing the value of support in descending order according to the group's first unit, a representative value in ascending order according to support groups of the first units. In the following discussion for simplicity, we do not store in the mode from the closed mode to identify nodes in the tree nCP algorithm,, and as input where and are the minimum support and minimum correlation threshold. nCP algorithm contains two sets of frequent patterns and closed, and then calls a pre-order for the program to traverse the closed A model tree Note that, in dealing with closed pattern mining process, can be built. Pre-order traversal in the period, whenever the vertex of a triangle is accessed, all the combinations, which are stored in the sub-node, and the support value will be the order of testing Figure 2\. This is a pre-sorting and recycling of the 3-7 line to complete the cycle. During the pre-order traversal, through and \(pre-order in line 5\ Run the ring to create a new group This group is used to consider the model, so that and. If you do not apply pruning equivalent. Result, all combinations are in a closed mode by pre-order tree traversal to consider Fig.2 Preorder traversal in a closed pattern tree and the check of pattern pairs Figure 3 illustrates the nCP the pruning mechanism. First pruning is based on Lemma 1. For the model, if less than the lower boundary or, then skip the loop through the remaining process, they will not join. As previously mentioned, is used to consider the model, so that and. Jie Guo, by not to be joined we can avoid regardless of mode pairs V C ONCLUSION For multidimensional Apriori association mining algorithm used, in order to provide an automated support threshold settings, we propose in this paper set the minimum support an intelligent system architecture, the integration of user preference models. Using this method, the system queries the specified user in the user preferences model to find the most similar to the query, they add up to the scope of access to appropriate support for user reference. According to our proposed method, Apriori algorithm is used to support threshold set is no longer entirely subjective, but also the experience from the additional knowledge of other users. This structure improves the efficiency of the process user queries access to the rules or mining also tend to close the user's requirements R EFERENCES 1 P. Songram V. Boo njing S.

locate   s conditional PLMS-tree in the mining of sequence     s super-patterns. In line 7 through 9, we examine the mps of each node n  and record their minimum mps This value will be used in next step  In line 12 through line 18, secondly, we generate candidate  patterns and output sequential patterns according to each item's icount  Three conditions may occur here The first is that the icount satisfies MIS   This sequence is directly appended to icount 40% which reaches the MIS bde 30%, pattern bde   can be joined into the sequential patterns set. We can see that an infrequent pattern's super set become frequent pattern in this case that is why we need to consider about the  mps  value The other sequential patterns which are started from other items are generated in the same way Finally we can have the complete sequential patterns with MMS by MSCP-growth algorithm the sequential patterns set. The second is that the icount doesn't  V  C ONCLUTION satisfy MIS   but satisfies mps That is, the sequence is currently not a sequential pattern but its super-pattern i.e appending suffix in the sequence has possibility to be Therefore both two conditions have to keep growing and recursively call procedure MSCP-growth for further examining their super-patterns. The third is that the count of sequence doesn't satisfy both MIS   and mps It means that any super- pattern of the sequence   will never be a sequential pattern The procedure will terminate while the root set becomes empty  We use the constructed PLMS-tree in Fig.12 to explain the  mining process in detail At first the  RS  is root and we trace all nodes belong to the first item e in HT According to the nlink of  item e from HT we find \(_ e 1:11111001 n 1 at first, the  position code shows that n 1 is a descent node of RS and n 1 is not recounted in the same branch  n 1  icount  will be add into icount  since n 1 does not have any child node, no node will be  joined into nRS According to the nlink in \(_ e 1:11111001\, the  next node \(_ e 2:101 n 2 will be found n 2 is a descent node of  root and n 2 is not recounted n 2  icount will be added into icount  n 2  also has a child node \(_ c 2:1011\, that can be joined into the  nRS to be a new root set if we need to growth this pattern. And  the next node \(_ e 1:10111011\ is recounted so the node count of this node will not be added into icount Since the icount of In this study, we first address the rare item problem in the  mining of sequential patterns To generate more interesting patterns we extend the concept of MMS on sequential pattern mining and propose an algorithm named MSCP growth to discover complete set of sequential pattern with MMS In experimental study we will compare three well-known traditional methods including GSP PrefixSpan and PLWAP tree with MSCP-growth using several synthetic datasets as well as real-life datasets. Some research directions are briefly  discussed First users may have to tune items supports many times while discovering useful patterns Instead of restarting the whole mining process it is valuable if a support tuning mechanism can be developed Second the concept of MMS can be further applied to constraint-based sequential pattern mining such as time constraints or duration constraints    R EFERENCES item  e  is 60 which reaches the candidate growth condition we mentioned before, we use the nRS and e as a candidate pattern to generate new patterns Pattern  e  also reaches the threshold of sequential pattern i.e MIS e  and can be joined into the sequential patterns set. The second step uses the node in the nRS  _ c 2:1011\, as the new root set of conditional tree to growth new pattern\(s According to  HT  the  icount  of first item e  rooted by _ c 2:1011 is 20 which does not reach the candidate growth condition The  icount  of second item  c  in  HT rooted by _ c 2:1011 is 40 which reaches the condition to growth new candidate patterns so we use the child nodes of _ c 2:1011 _ a 1:10111\ and \(_ b 1:10111\, as nRS to generate new candidate patterns. This pattern also larger than MIS ec which means it can be joined into the sequential patterns set. The complete sequential patterns set with beginning item  e  can be generated by repeating these steps  The reason we use the mps value and candidate growth will  show in following example. We trace the item b now, the icount  of item b is 100% which reaches the condition to generate new candidate and the threshold to be joined into the sequential patterns set. As the tracing step goes, we have the icount of item d 60 in the suffix tree of pattern  b  it reaches the  mps  value=30%, which is the second condition to candidate growth we mentioned before, and it means that this pattern still has possibility to be part of sequential pattern Noted that it doesn't reach MIS bd 65 which means it is not a sequential pattern In the next candidate growth step, we have item e with 1     2    3     4     5      6     7     8      9   Y.-H.

Post Mining o/Non-redundant Association Rules /or Sensor Data Estiamtion In this subsection, we describe our proposed technique for post mining of non-redundant association rules for sensor data estimation purpose. This algorithm is developed based on non-redundant informative association rules which means all rules cannot be derived from other rules and the left hand side and right hand side of the selected rules contain the input itemset. There are some research works that can generate the closed itemsets and corresponding association rules using generated closed itemsets [3 , 18 Based on our previous works [8] we assume to have the non-redundant association rules ready and the criteria of selecting the rules from non-redundant rules further reduce the number of rules to the minimum In this algorithm, dn.vm is treated as one item in association rules. Dn represents the sensor which is indexed as n. Vm represents the value of the sensor n is read as m. In the following figure, Xinput is the itemset represent the current round of sensor readings, it can be represented by a set of dn.vm pairs. Xl and X2 are the itemsets in left hand side and right hand side of association rules. Z represents all items in X2/Xinput. Index\(z z and value of sensor value pair z. Confidence{Xl=>X represents the confidence of the rule Xl=>X2 Support\(Xl=>X2 C represents the confidence of association rule, dn V represents the identifier and value pair of the sensor dn Xestimate represents the returned estimation itemset which contains the senor identifiers with missing values in the current round of readings of stream data and their corresponding estimated values. Sspecify represents the user specified support, and Cspecify represents the user-specified confidence The algorithm is described as below. The input of the procedure Estimate includes the current round of sensor reading, current association rule confidence, user-specified minimum support and user-specified minimum confidence 


In line 4, all association rules that satisfy with the conditions of minimum support and confidence are selected The confidence of the select association rules are calculated in line 5. The condition of line 6 filters out the rules whose left hand side itemset Xl does not contain the itemset Xinput in this case, sensor identifier is filtered based on the enriched contextual information. The condition of line 7 filters out the rules whose right hand side itemset X2 does not contain new estimated items. Each new item was processed in line 8 and 9 so that missing sensor values are V5-104 2010 2nd International Conference on Education Technology and Computer \(ICETC modified and updated.

Several different simulation experiments are conducted in order to evaluate the proposed technique and compare it with the Average Window Size A WS linear trend approach, and with the WARM approach, the state-of-the-art data estimation algorithm in sensor databases using 2-frequent itemsets based association mining [6]. We compared the estimation accuracy, running time and memory space usage when applying different methods to the application dataset The dataset was collected in year 2000 at various locations throughout the city of Austin, Texas. The data represents the current location, the time interval, and the number of vehicles detected during this interval. All sensor nodes report to a single server. The sensors are deployed on city streets, collect and store the number of the vehicles detected for a given time interval. The vehicle counts taken as sensor readings that are used as input for our simulation experiments are traffic data provided by [2 A. Performance Study of Estimation Accuracy The evaluation of the estimation accuracy of the missing values is done by using the average Root Mean Square Error RMSE I'\(xa, -Xe 1 ___ l __ lI_?''? ____ _ numStates # estimations where Xa; and Xe; are the actual value and the estimated value, respectively; #estimations is the number of estimations performed in a simulation run; and numStates is the number of subsets, in which the actual readings are distributed The expression u  xa, -Xe estimations error and is an estimate of the standard deviation under the assumption that the errors in the estimated values \(i.e. Xai Xei 


see the smaller the RMSE, the better the estimation accuracy From Figure 2, we can see that the proposed technique gives the best average estimation result of the above approaches regarding the accuracy, followed by the WARM approach. The linear interpolation, A WS, and linear trend approaches perform no better than WARM and the proposed approaches. From Figure 2, we can also see that the proposed technique gives the best estimation result on the maximum estimation accuracy, which is the root square error for the maximum difference between the estimated and accurate values 0.6 0.5 0.4 w n 0.3 cz 0.2  Average 0.1  Maximum 0 l' ?? 0" </.,oQ Figure 2.

Performance Study of Memory Usage Figure 4 illustrates the memory usage of A WS, linear interpolation, linear trend, WARM and proposed approaches in MB. The experimental results show that in terms of memory space, the WARM approach is outperformed by all the other four approaches. The results of the simulation experiments show that for 108 sensors the needed memory space using WARM is much higher than that using proposed approach. This is because the closed lattice data structure uses less memory space than the cube data structures, and it only stores the condensed closed itemsets information Figure 4. Performance study of memory usage for traffic monitoring application in MB V. CONCLUSTIONS Sensor stream applications are becoming very common with the advances in technologies for sensor devices. In this paper we propose a method to post mine non-redundant association rules, and used the result to produce missing data estimation in sensor network applications. The objective is to further reduce the resulting rules from non redundant association rule mining based on the users request, and apply the retrieved meaningful information to perform missing data estimation in wireless sensor networks We have evaluated the proposed technique with real data from a wireless sensor network of a traffic monitoring site Our proposed method is able to estimate missing sensor value with both time and space efficiency, and greatly improves the estimation accuracy. Our performance study 


shows that proposed post mining of association rule mining technique for missing sensor data estimation is an area worth to explore REFERENCES 1] Agrawal, R., & Imielinski, T., & Swami, A., "Mining association rules between sets of items in massive databases", International Conference on Management of Data, 1993 2] Austin, F.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
