Despite IPv6 has better security than IPv4, but there still have some security issues. So it is an urgent problem to requirement of IDS for IPv6 networks Many intelligent information processing methods, data mining technology and so on have been applied to improve detection accuracy for IPv4 network. At first IPv6 security issues has been analysis in this paper, secondly discussed the IPv6 intrusion detection model, then we in accordance with such a model present an intrusion detection model realization for IPv6 network and we propose a strategy for the system achieve and optimization. The system can work well for intrusion detection for IPv6 network KEYWORDS: Libpcap;data analysis;data mining;IPv6 I.  INTRODUCTION With the vigorous development of Internet, it has become the focus of global concern to its complexity accessibility and openness brought information security issue. Intrusion detection \(ID management system for computers and networks. An intrusion detection system \(IDS outbound network activity and identifies patterns that may indicate a network or system detects attack from someone attempting to break into or compromise a system IPv6 has been definition by the IETF based on the IPv4 with the development of its security mechanisms, networklayer security has been enhanced, but also put forward new demands and challenges to the existing network security system. IDS system against IPv4networks might also affect on an IPv6 network, but it is difficult to process new IPv6 functions and security functions such as neighbor discovery or auto configuration, and so on II. IPV6 SECURITY In this subsection we mainly concentrate on explaining 


typical attacks about IPv6 protocol A. Misuse of ICMPv6 and multicast Some important mechanisms in IPv6 networks, such as neighbor discovery and path maximum-transmission-unit discovery, are dependent on some types of ICMPv6 messages ICMPv6 specification also allows an error notification response to be sent to multicast addresses \(if a packet was targeted to a multicast address an attacker. By sending a suitable packet to a multicast address an attacker can cause multiple responses targeted at the victim \(the spoofed source of the multicast packet B. Reconnaissance attacks Reconnaissance techniques are the same for IPv4 and IPv6, but the subnet size in the IPv6 network is much larger than in the IPv4 network \(the default size is 64 bits Unfortunately, some types of multicast addresses used in IPv6 networks can help an intruder to identify and attack some resources in the targeted network. RFC 2375 [4 defines a node, a link and site-specific use of multicast addresses \(e.g. all routers have a site-specific address FF05::2 C. Fragmentation related attacks IPv6 protocol specification does not allow packet fragmentation by intermediary devices. The minimum recommended MTU size for IPv6 is 1280 octets. It is recommended security practice to drop all fragments with less than 1280 octets unless the packet is the last in the flow Using fragmentation an intruder can achieve that port numbers are not found in the first fragment and in that way bypass security monitoring devices \(which do not reassemble fragments protocol data in the first fragment. By sending a large number of small fragments an attacker can cause an overload of reconstruction buffers on the target system potentially implying a system to crash D. Misuse of routing headers According to, all IPv6 nodes have to be capable of processing routing headers. This behavior produces some security problems. It is possible that an intruder sends a packet to a publicly accessible address with a routing header containing a forbidden, address \(address on the victim 


network packet to a destination address stated in the routing header forbidden address is filtered In summary, today the intrusion detection system for IPv4 network, can not effectively detect IPv6 packets which need to achieve a new intrusion detection system model based on IPv6 network III.  INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM Detect and invasion is the central to Intrusion detection technology, its goal is to provide detection intrusion function, and take appropriate protective measures. It 2010 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications 978-0-7695-4115-0/10 $26.00  2010 Crown Copyright DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2010.89 384 specifically includes data collection, behavior classification reporting errors and to respond to counter-attack, etc. In which data can be used by a specialized network management system \(NMS to get, and data derivation and data classification is one of the core. Data classification is a process of define attack and identify attack. To realization this process, we have a wide variety of technology, such as pattern matching, statistical analysis, integrity analysis, and so on. Most of theirs is find the differences state between states, as a way to determine whether the system has been invaded There are two kinds of detection methods for network based intrusion detection system. it has two kinds of detection methods: Anomaly detection and misuse detection method. Anomaly detection method is establishment of behavior normal standards, if behavior goes beyond the norms defined, it will be seen as abnormal behavior. Misuse detection is formally defined as abuses or unethical surreptitious, unauthorized, or illegal uses of network services by those who attempt to mask their uses or presence that evade the management and monitoring of network or system administrators. Misuses of network services would inappropriately use resources of network service providers compromise the confidentiality of information maintained in network service providers, and/or prevent other users from using the network normally and securely. Network misuse 


intrusion detection systems \(misuse NIDS new kinds of attack signatures to detect malicious network attacks. However, a very large number of features may include a number of the current network environment characteristics but not to need, which cause the system to spend limit processing resources to solve characteristics of not related, it would seriously affecting efficiency of the system. As network traffic increases, too many features would produce extra packet inspection, it would even affect online protection by the system provides Anomaly detection based on intrusion behavior violate the normal system behavior. One advantage of anomaly detection is it can detect unknown attack patterns The paper proposed intrusion detection model based on the data mining technology, it can scan vulnerability from the semantic level of vulnerability, digging out the normal behavior then do patterns compare to completion the anomaly detection IV. IPV6 INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM The work of system divided into two parts, as shown Fig.1  Figure 1.  Intrusion detection system mode The first phase generate pattern mining library according to the training data. This phase includes data analysis, data pre-processing, pattern mining The second phase is detection current data according to the model of established by the training phase, to determine whether there is invasion. Including data analysis, data preprocessing, pattern comparison  V. PACKET ANALYSIS AND PRE-PROCESSING A. A The main function framework for Analysis System This article catch the IPv6 packets based on Libpcap. The basic process is: The main function first opens the corresponding network interface, and then set compile the filtering rules, then catch packets and call the callback function, the final closure of the corresponding equipment To set filtering rules as follows char bpf_filter_string If there is no character inside quotation marks, it said they did not set the capture conditions, for all packet capture 


If we only want capture IPv6 packet, we can be set to "ip6 The Libpcap capture packet based on BPF filters, and its designed in order to user-level programs enable to high efficient access the original untreated network data packets Libpcap only supports BPF interface kernel filter, without the support of BPF, all data packets will be read into the user space B. Association Rule Mining Association rule discovery, the area being studied most actively technique to investigate the possibility of simultaneous occurrence of the data. Let I={i1,i2,,im} be a set of literals, called items. Let D be a set of transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that T?I. An association rule is an implication of the form X?Y, where X I,Y ? I,X ? Y=?. Support and confidence are used to describe the interestingness or goodnessof a rule as follows support\(X?Y X?Y confidence\(X?Y X|Y Original network data Data Analysis Pretreatment Pattern mining library Pattern comparison Current network data Output Data Analysis Pretreatment 385 or confidence\(X?Y X?Y X The support of the rule X ? Y is proportion of transactions in D that contain X?Y. The confidence of the association rule X ? Y is the proportion of transactions including both X and Y to all the transactions that association that may happen only among the data that satisfy the minimum support and minimum confidence set by the users. All item sets that have support greater than or equal to the user specified minimum support are generated C. Construction of the candidate feature attribute There is a variety of attribute values in captured network data packets, The basic property is {DIP, DPort Flag, Protocol, Service, State} by extract from the original 


network data. A variety of attacks against the network, its target usually is a host or a service. Thus, the system will serve type and destination host IP as the primary attribute other attributes as a reference attribute. At the same time account the correlation between network attack and time, the system uses the statistical properties of time window. Early experimental result shows \(Lee 1998 detection port or denial of service attacks, etc., usually the time window in 30s completed. At this time the network state almost stabilized. Therefore, in order to increase the main attributes impact to the pattern mining, to improve the accuracy of intrusion detection. The system constructs timerelated primary attribute, its time window is 30s. Table 1 Property Name Meaning Host_count In a time window within the target host with the current connection records number of same connect Same_srv_rate At the same destination host its same connect to service destination port rate Diff_srv_rate At the same destination host its different connect to service destination port rate Same_srv_count At the same destination host its same connect to Service Destination Port with currently connected number Srv_diff_host_rate At the same service?its different connect to destination host rate TABLE I.  CANDIDATE TIME RELEVANT ATTRIBUTES In this way, the system have 11 properties by captured data packets and extract the properties D. Data Preprocessing In association rule mining based on rough set theory the rough set theory mainly used in the pretreatment to conditions attribute data, Data padded and numerical attributes discrete. The experimental data of missing values is very few, so we used it by direct deletion. Discretization of numerical attributes we use Semi Native Scaler algorithm for discrete. The specific algorithm as follows 


To each attribute value a?A, make breakpoint set Ca do the following 1 makes the adjacent objects xi?xi+1 follow vai?vai+1, vai vai+1?Va 2 number frequency to a collection of decision-making value in the corresponding decision-making be calculated Di?Di+1 Di={v?Vd| v=arg maxv|{x?[xi] a|d\(x Di+1={v?Vd| v=arg maxv|{x?[xj] a|d\(x 3 Di?Di+1 Di+1?Di then Ca= Ca?{\(vai+ vai+1 VI. IMPROVE ALGORITHM We can solve the associate rule mining problem in two steps 1 database D 2 frequent itemsets The first step is the most difficult in the mining process After discovering all the frequent itemsets, it is easy to computer the relative association rules. Algorithm Apriori is the most effective among these mining algorithms. The algorithm be shown as follows Step0. Scan the database D to find out L1 Step1. Ck, k>1, is generated by joining the itemsets in Lk1. The itemsets in Ck which have some\(k-1 in Lk-1 are deleted Step2. The support of itemsets in Ck is calculated through database scan to decide Lk Step3. Go to step 1 until Lk The algorithms implement a method that extracts frequent items through scanning the transactional database repeatedly. However, the spending for scanning the database is so lavish that the efficiency of the algorithm databases Therefore, we take the interestingness into account and improve on the basic algorithm In the practical application of association rules sometimes excavated in the rules contains some do not want to get attributes. For example, this rule is derived: "IP address ? MAC address" or the "Service \(HTTP 


80 386 complexity of derivation; Increase the size of the pattern library; affecting the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection. In order to improve efficiency of the algorithm association rules to restrict the premise and conclusion in appear properties \(set allowed appearing decision-making attributes and their corresponding values, other attributes only allowed appearing in the premise of rules. As this way, association rule is to be effective rules VII. PATTERN COMPARISON In the pattern comparison, after the pre-recorded the network connection records as the user's current mode. These connection records in rule library are called as historical pattern. Intrusion detection process is the process of model comparison. In the pattern comparison, we introduce the concept of similarity level characterized the degree of accord different behavior patterns. Similarity values range from [0 1], the higher the value explain the greater the similarity, that is, own the greater possibility of abnormal Using Similarity comparison algorithm, in the first we assume X and Y represent the connection records as you want to compare, X\(i records \(0?i+k?Length\(Y i?k is results of the comparison for X\(i i+k is described as follows F=Max[F\(k Y Which, F\(k i,k X Y The greater the results of comparison, the greater link records similarity. In this system, if set F is greater than 0.7 we would considered as abnormal behavior VIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS A. Experimental Design For experimenting purposes at the Institute of Computer Network, a small IPv6 network has been established. The network consists of five computer. All computers have been configured as dual-boot configurations driven by MS Windows XP \(with SP2 included systems. Also, all computers in the experimental network have been configured as dual-stack devices supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols 


In the described experimental network some IPv6 intrusion detection tests have been done. Different types of DoS attacks have been performed. Through continuous monitor network streams data in 18 hours, we get the intrusion behavior and some normal connections. Much real streams data are also been performed upon this model Experimental results and some possibilities for their successful detection will be analyzed in next subsection B. Testing Result Tests in Table 2 are done with testing data set. In order to find the relationship between detection accuracy and minimum supports with the same attributes, experiments are done with data of different minimum supports. The classifying result is shown in Table 2 Support 0.05% 0.06% 0.07% 0.08 True 72 70 71 69 False 28 30 29 31 Accuracy 72% 70% 71% 69 TABLE II.

An improved association rule discovering system under IPv6 network has been studied in this paper. We improved the base Apriori algorithm, this makes association rule mining techniques applicable to IPv6 network, and achieved good experimental results After analysis of experimental results found, although data mining-based intrusion detection model has advantages in the detection performance and universal, however, the systems still exist the following difficulties 1 detection method than the traditional detect has higher false detection rate 2 training data, and more complexity than traditional systems ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This paper is part of the project supported by Stadholder Foundation of Guizhou Province \(Grant No.2007\(14 Graduate Innovation Fund of Guozhou University: Research key technologies of network management in IPv6 network environment \(Grant No.2010006 express his appreciation to the supporter REFERENCES 1] RFC 2375: IPv6 Multicast Address Assignments 2] RFC 2460: Internet Protocol, Version 6 \(IPv6 3] RFC 2463: Internet Control Message Protocol \(ICMPv6 Specification 4] Bishop, M., Cheung, S., Wee, C., Frank, J., Hoagland, J., Samorodin S.: The Threat from the Net.

good rule cv with less nr.  Although the acc of 70:30 model was 0.5 higher than 60:40, the distinction was not significant as well as had generated the greater nr. The model with lesser nr but generates good acc is better than model that use more rule to generate same result [12]. Table VI shows the rule classification of the best model. The last column depicts the nr of each programming skill and tr is the number of training record to generate nr   TABLE VI.

The rule sample of the excellent and weak group From the analysis on the generated rules, it shows that student with programming experience before enter the university has benefit to score the programming subject However, some rules indicate that the programming background is not guarantee the student can score programming well. The result was similar to [7, 10, 11].  In line with many literatures, gender plays important role when male is performed better than female. Furthermore, rough set analysis found that student can score programming well with only the average grade in Mathematic and English during SPM at least at grade C subject might face difficulties in learning programming Additionally, another finding which is contradict with previous study is the majority of excel group student has good grade in Malay Language \(at least B grade program that needs student to enroll programming subject, all programs have similar chances to score the subject The relationship between personality factors towards programming grades was also investigated.  Out of 3003 rules of excellent group, there are 2184 rules which describe the personality test result.  We further investigated all rules and from the analysis, many students with investigative type and average cognitive ability have ability to excel programming The findings were similar to [7, 11]. Interestingly, rough set also identified that the social type student also can do programming well. From the literature, a social type is an emphatic, warm, kind, patient and helpful person as well as prefers to teach and help others. Figure 6 summarizes the rule analysis of personality test of the excellent group. The figure shows that the highest score of the investigative type student C11-C20 and C21-C32 social type student. Based on Holland the theory, it is not suggested the personality of student must fall into one the six categories, but rather are composed of one each of the six 


personality orientation. Generally, the Investigative, Artistic and Social are expected to associate together and less of the characteristic associated with Realistic, Enterprising, or conventional personality type [18  Figure 6.

CONCLUSION In this paper, a dataset of undergraduate student from Faculty of IT, UUM was mined using rough set technique Formerly, there were several researches had mined the data using statistic, clustering, and association rule. This study was aimed to identify another unique characteristic that influence student programming grade using other data analysis method The study indicates that student prior experience in programming before university can contributes to a good grade but it is not guarantee that they can easily score the subject The study also reveals that average grades in Mathematic English, and Malay language during SPM also can influence the final grade. Moreover, male student performance is looked better than female.  In term of personality factor, the investigative and social type plus average cognitive person are found as important factors that influence programming.  This finding can be a guideline for the faculty to plan teaching and learning program for new registered student  REFERENCES  1] Z.H.Khan.
