It is the main vital organ for exchanging 
material with external effect. It plays an important role in plant growth and productio n. Researchers have carried out a large number of experiments in multi-disciplinary perspective from various fields. The effect of many factors on plant root syst em has investigated. R oot morphology, root distribution, and root functions as related to external effect have been studied The external factor to root growth is complex and diverse The practice of root growth simulation up to now had not met the requirement of digital plant. Domain knowledge proposed in 1980s, has driven greatly development of related  
rnal effects model database as a foundation, uses multidimensional association rule of Apriori algorithm to decompose the complex influence to root growth into separate SIF. The simulation on SIF’s effect to root growth is easily to be carried on. With the support of a large quantity of scientific practical results, a domain knowledge database of SIF’s effect to root growth could be constructed. The effect value of SI F to root growth can be collected by the process of association rule adoption and data quantization. Combined with the reconstruction of the effect of growth model database to single growth, a precise   Research Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China

The paper emphasizes the importance of constructing root-soil system domain knowledge database discusses data mining and associati on rule for SIF, selecting of effective SIF and quantification of its effect to root growth, finally uses OpenAlea and root growth model to achieve the visualized simulation of root II C ONSTRUCTION FOR ROOT SOIL SYSTEM DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE DATABASE Domain knowledge is originated in the field of artificial intelligence. In the earlier 
1990s, after summarizing classification of knowledge representation, Alexander proposed that domai n knowledge is the relationship for concepts in a particular field a nd the constraint set for related concepts, it possesses all characters in a particular field of the knowledge Roots oil system domain knowledge construction is aimed at collecting factors that affect root growth, quantizing data and forming a stable database for application. SIF and their inter-relationship is the knowledge ontology to constitute the root-soil domain knowledge and the base to build the foundation of th e root-soil domain knowledge database Domain ontology is a speci 
alized ontology used to describe designated domain kn owledge, which provides domain physical concepts and th eir relationship, domain activities, a formal description of the characteristics and laws in the field. Formally, it is de fined as: Knowledge Ontology Knowledge Atom Relationship, Rule In root-soil system domain knowledge, the impact of SIF to root is act as knowledge ele ment; the objective link among the factors is knowledge relation; the potential laws which followed by interacting factors are defined as rules A Knowledge element, knowledge relations for root-soil system domain knowledge Decomposes the complex external effects \(such as: soil 
compaction, watering, fertilizing, plowing, etc namely, knowledge element of root-soil system domain knowledge. The SIF are objective and possible to be quantized. Moreover, the studies in SIF to root growth are fruitful, reliable and complete, for example, root gravity tropism, water tropism to growt h, N.P to root growth rhizome-sphere microscope creature to root growth, etc Store the research results into database is a support to construct root-soil system domain knowledge from physics chemistry and biology.

knowledge elements and form an intuitive visualized drawing is one of the focal point of this project, besides, it needs a vast amount of knowledge data and to be further verified by practice 1 Acquire the factors Thanks to summary on a large number of complete studies, this project refers to so il science, soil chemistry botany, soil micro-biology, e xtracts 46 kinds of common SIF that affect root growth, and sel ects 28 kinds of them, which influence largely on crops growth. These core SIF are selected depending on their fr equency appeared in root-soil system domain knowledge and their impact to root growth They come from four major categories of external forces and forces caused by external effects and through domain knowledge database mini ng rules and selections 2 Determining the relationship of the factors Th e relationship construction of the factors follows the rules below: the frequency that SIF appears in a field, its close relationship to a keyword an d the degree of support in this field 3 Constructing a relationship figure for factors W ith the analysis on a large quantity of experiment conclusion, we can construct a relationship graph of impact factors, which expresses the relationship of the factors directly and vividly. It is ben eficial to make further analysis on the relationship of SIF. Th e relationship plays a decisive role in constructing association rule among each impact     Figure 1 SIF relationship of Rootsoil system domain knowledge B Rules and algorithms for root-soil system  domain knowledge 1 Rules R ules in domain knowledge are the rules and operations combined by relations of know ledge elements or knowledge entity. They are the most important part in domain knowledge modeling. The rul es are acquired from the domain knowledge, inference knowledge and task knowledge in a specific filed so that constructs relationship for knowledge elements and quan tizes data for application then use Protege computer language to store the date in domain knowledge database 2 Multidimensional associ ation rule of Apriori a lgorithm When decomposes the complex external effects into SIF the interaction of SIF is considered, quantized and separated Ultimately, the data of SIF to r oot growth is stored. In this project, aiming at separating th e influence from SIF to root growth under external effects, multidimensional association rule of Apriori algorithm for data mining is adopted Suppose I={i 1 i 2  003ž\003 i m is a set of items, I represents factors set of root-soil system domain knowledge. D t 1 t 2  003ž\003 t n is a set of database transactions, it represents a set of some external effects. T is a item set and T 002\003 I  Suppose A \(SIF\ set, if and only if A 002\003 T T contains A. The percentage of fre quency for item set A in transaction database of the to tal transaction databases is called support. If the support for item set exceeds the minimum support threshold value, the set is named frequent item set. Association rule is an implication formed as A 004 B in which A 002 I, B 002 I and A 005 B 006 then A is called the rule conditions, B as the result of the rules. If n% of the transaction in transaction databases consists of A 007 B claimed the support of association rule A 004  Support of association rule A 004 B to transaction set D is defined as percentage of transaction A and B of D. While confidence of association rule A 004 B to transaction set D is defined as percentage of transaction A of B. Namely Support\(A 004 B 004\010 P\(A 007\010 transaction number of A and B/ transaction number 003j 100 0048 
1068 


Confidence\(A 004 B 004\010 P\(B|A\=\( transaction number of A and B / transaction number of A 003j 100 0048 The rules which satisfy the minimum support threshold value and minimum confidence threshold value are named as strong rules. The setting of the threshold value determines the precision of ru les, and it is also used to control SIF correlation. Once the root-soil system domain knowledge is established, after several rounds of association and threshold selection rules, SIF’s effects to r oot growth final date can be obtained III V ISUAL SIMULATION SYSTEM PROCESSES The root-soil domain knowledge database is the core part of visualized simulation and it is the basis to make the method to be realized. Through the decomposition quantification and reconstruction of the input data in rootsoil domain knowledge database, decompose and quantize the complex external effects into separate SIF, and then adopt relevant computer language for storing domain knowledge database of SIF’s effect to root d  on root-soil domain knowl edge database, a visualized simulation flow chat can be built, as figure 2 shows             Figure 2 Visual simulation flow chart The visualized simulation flow chat is as follows: \(1 Input one external effect in Linux system platform, the external effect and the model database of external effect can realize model matching and make the database learned and updated at real time by memory function. \(2\data mining for several times in the root-soil system domain knowledge database; decom pose the matching external effect into SIF knowledge atom; bu ild the relationship of SIF use Apriori multidimensional associated algorithm rules to found knowledge atom rules; then select effective SIF by threshold value. Obtain dec omposed separate SIF through many times of associating and algorithm operation; store root-soil system domain kn owledge database in Protege language and make the database learned and updated. \(3 Select the decomposed SIF and match them with the existing effect database of SIF, use MA TLAB Simulink toolbox to quantize the matching factors, so that effect value of SIF can be acquired. In the matching process of SIF, its effect database can be updated accordingly. \(4\quantized SIF’s data into root growth model database, then amend the parameters of root growth model and input the parameters into OpenAlea software, ulti mately the root growth visualization under effects fr om outside world can be realized IV E XPERIMENT AND SIMULATION The impact of soil compaction to root has been studied widely and deeply. Reasonable com paction on root is benefit to its growth, on the contrary soil structure will be degraded and corps growth can be affected by unreasonable conditions such as increased soil density or mechanical resistance, low porosity, deterioration of so il physical, chemical and biological nature This experiment takes soil compaction as one external effect. Use root-so il system domain knowledge constructing method based on SIF relational analysis to match the existing databases, and then adopt OpenAlea software to achieve a visualized simulation of soil compaction effect on cotton root growth. This visualized simulation picture of cotto n root has been compared with root that effected by method of root-washing and that in norm Figure 3 No soil compaction, 70 days, cotton root, washing root method

Figure 4 1.0g/cm 3 soil compaction, 70 days, cotton root, washing root method Figure 5 1.0g/cm 3 soil compaction, 70 days, cotton root, the method this article provided Figure 3 and 4 indicates that soil compaction largely influences the root growth and root configuration. The application of washed root measurement simulation can prompt a real root growth simu lation picture, which becomes a reference to other applications. Compare figure 4 and 5, we can find that carries on simulation to the identical sample under the condition of soil co mpaction, the root simulation picture obtained by using the me thod this article provided is almost the same as the actual root configuration. So this method can be adopted to provide a more realistic simulation of root growth under the outside world V C ONCLUSIONS The use of root-soil system domain knowledge constructing method based on rel ational analysis of SIF can help to decompose the complex external effects to root growth into SIF. The technology that decomposes and quantizes the external effect in specific domain into SIF has been widely applied to and completed in other fields. The experiment result indicates that do main knowledge in study of root growth is available for practice. Its significance lies in its advantages compared with technologies in the past The original technologies need a large number of experiments with low efficiency and big errors. However, by constructing domain knowledge database, thanks to data mining, data decomposing and dat a reconstructing, the root growth visualized simulation can be realized effectively furthermore, the database could be updated unceasingly This paper puts forward a new method on complex external effect to root growth simulati on and achieves an exploratory study for domain knowledge applications in digital agriculture R EFERENCES  A.J.

The input database is partitioned in three partition P1,P2 and P3 by means of month granularity time period. Assume min_FTUsupport = 82 and minconf =  1. From the partition P1, all  possible candidate 2-itemsets such as :{\(1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5 1,6 2,3 2,4 2,4 2,5 2,6 3,4 3,5 3,6 4,5 4,6 5,6            2 Example: Consider a two-itemset {2,3}. External utility of items {2} and {3} in partition  P 1  are 10 and 8 which are obtained from the utility table. The internal utility value of items are obtained by  computing Iu\( {2},Tq Tq ? P1  Iu\( {3},Tq Tq ? P1 respectively. Then, the utility value of an itemset {2,3} is U\(2,3 12*10 16*8 2,3} is  f  \( { 2, 3 } , P1 support of itemset {2,3} is  FTUsupport\(2,3 2*248  Figure 1.

itemset The same procedure is repeated for all other candidate 2itemsets. Finally the itemsets whose  FTU support  values falling below  min_FTUsupport    are removed and the selected itemsets are considered as FTU 2-itemsets of partition 1 TABLE I.  UTILITY TABLE         3 mining of FTU 2-itemsets \(P1 + P2  Example: The partition P2 is taken into account and the candidate 2-itemsets in partition P2  are generated. For each candidate 2-itemsets, FTUsupport values are computed based on the procedure described in the previous step. In addition, the candidate 2-itemsets that are satisfying min_FTUsupport  in the previous step may or may not be a FTU 2-itemsets in a current partition P2. It is identified by jointly computing its occurrence frequency value and also its utility values in partition P1 + P2 Then, the candidate 2-itemsets whose FTUsupport values greater than min_FTUsupport are selected as FTU 2-itemsets in both partitions P1 + P2 .The itemsets that are obtained from the previous partition to the current partition are called as  ?type  candidate itemsets and the newly generated candidate itemsets in the current partition P2 is called as ?-type candidate itemsets From the sample database, FTUsupport  of ?-type  itemset 2,3 FTUsupport for all itemsets in ?-type  and ?-type are calculated The itemsets are filtered based on the min_FTUsupport. From the sample database the itemsets {\(2,3 3,5 the next step 4 P1 + P2 +....+Pn Example : In this step the partition P 3 s considered and all 


FTU 2-itemsets are  computed based on the previous step. The above process is repeated until all the partition Pn is processed to mine only those FTU 2-itemsets. In step the itemsets 2,6 3,6 5 Example : In this step, the resultant FTU 2- itemsets are used for generating the candidate 1-itemsets. In our sample database, we have generated the candidate1-itemsets { 23,3 63,3,33,3,63,3} from FTU 2-itemsets  {\(2,6 3,6 redundant sub-itemset  \(63,3 candidate 1-itemsets as {23,3 , 63,3,33,3}. Then , FTUsupport values of these sub-itemsets are calculated by scanning the database. Here, the sub-itemset  33,3 is removed since its FTUsupport  is less than the min_FTUsupport value 6 K ? 2 Example: The FTU 3 itemsets are generated by combining the FTU 2itemsets in accordance with the time property. Then, the occurrence frequency and also the utility support values of the FTU 3-itesets are calculated by scanning the database. The generated candidate 3itemsets, whose FTU-support is greater than min_FTUsupport    are termed as FTU 3-itemsets. By using these procedures FTU K-itemsets K >3 In this example the candidate 3-itemset \(2,3,6 generated by combing the FTU 2-itemsets \(2,6 3,6 Then the corresponding FTUsupport value of candidate 3 itemsets are computed and also the FTU 3-itemsets are selected based on the  min_FTUsupport  value 7 Example : In this step, we have generated utility oriented temporal association rules using all FTU itemsets in the form of \( X ?

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The experimental results of the UTARM algorithm for mining of utility oriented temporal association rules are explained in this section.  The Proposed UTARM algorithm has been implemented using JAVA \(jdk 1.6 experimenting , we have used T10I4D100K dataset[15],which is widely accepted synthetic data generated using existing tools T10I4D100K : This dataset contains 100,000 transactions and 870 distinct items. T10I4100K denotes the average size of transactions\(T itemsets\(I D dataset should have number of partitions, which contain a set of transactions and every item presented should have quantity and profit. So, preprocessing is done, i.e., we divide the input database into partitions. For each partition we used a random number generator to generate random numbers, which mimic the quantity of an item sold for each transaction. Also, for each item in the partition, we have assigned random number that specifies the profit vale. From the database, we have partitions Items P1 P2 P3 1 2 3 4 5 6 4

The input database is given to the proposed algorithm for mining utility oriented association rules. For various support and confidence values, the rules are generated and the results are given in Table 3 and Fig.2 From the Table III we conclude that number of rules generated is proportional to the support and confidence values These two measures filters the number of rules generated as that of min_FTUsupport  and minconf plays  an important role for generating utility oriented temporal association rules TABLE III.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK We have presented an efficient algorithm for mining of utility oriented temporal association rule. The proposed work is extended from traditional ARM by incorporating the 


temporal and utility factor for mining significant association rules. The proposed algorithm mines FTU itemsets from the database using the support computed by utility along with time constraints and finally, the utility oriented temporal association rules are generated. The experimentation is carried out on publication database and the experimental results proved that the proposed algorithm effectively discovers the utility oriented temporal association rules. The above algorithm can be extended for incremental mining      REFERENCES 1] G Anil Rajput, Ramesh Prasad Aharwal, Nidhi Chandel, Devendra Singh Solanki, Ritu Soni, Approaches of Classification to Policy of Analysis of Medical Data, International Journal of Computer Science and Network security, Vol.9, No.11, November 2009 2]  J.
