An Association Rule-Based Bilateral Multi-Issue Negotiation Model  Jun Hu College of Information Science and Engineering Hunan University Changsha, China E-mail: hujun_111@126.com Lei Deng College of Information Science and Engineering Hunan University Changsha, China E-mail: dengleistone@126.com   Abstract In this paper, we present an association rule-based bilateral multi-issue negotiation model which uses association rules to describe the interdependence of issues. Moreover, we propose a novel time-dependent negotiation strategy which based on association rules. In the negotiation process, agent can adjust the associated issues’ value intervals and negotiation time dynamically according to the corresponding association rules, thus reducing the number of interactions appropriately to improve the flexibility and efficiency of 
negotiation process. The experimental results show that the model can improve the overall utility and efficiency Keywords-MAS, Bilateral Negotiation, Association Rules RGM, Negotiation Strategy I  I NTRODUCTION  A bilateral multi-issue negotiation is an important research topic in Multi-Agent System MAS d the research of negotiation model usually based on the multiattribute utility theory [1  Fo r  tr a d iti o n a l m o d e ls w h ich  based on agenda [2 an d cas e 3    th ey di dn  t  c o n s id e r th e  dependence among each issue. However, in the actual negotiation process, this interdependence often existed and doubtless it increased the complexity of bilateral multi-issue negotiation. In recent years, researchers have also proposed solutions to solve this problem. For example, introducing an approximation approach  a Si m ul a t e d A nne a l i n g optimization method [5 is t o  tack l e th e c o m p lex ity p r o b lem  
of negotiation with interdependent issues. Robu et.al.[6  proposed a negotiation model which based on utility graph that describes the interdependence and reduces the complexity of negotiation through collaborative filtering[7 8 w e ve r  e a c h i ssue o n l y ha s t h e t w o val u e s  0 or 1   Gonzales et.al.[9 u s e d  g en e ral i ze d a d d itiv e in d ep en d e n c e GAI\ networks to represent the interdependence of issues but when the value interval of issue is continual or the value space is even large, the practical application of GAI-based models will be limited. These problems that result from utility graph-based model and GAI-based model can be solved in this paper. We propose an association rule-based bilateral multi-issue negotiation model which introduces the rule generation mechanism \(RGM\ to analyze the successful records from negotiations history. Then, constructing the association rule base and uses association rules to represent the interdependence of issues. According to the association 
rules agent can adjust the associated issues’ value range and negotiation time dynamically, thus improving the flexibility and efficiency of negotiation The remainder of the paper is organized as follows firstly, we describe a bilateral negotiation model which based on association rules; secondly, we present a rule generation mechanism; thirdly, we give a novel negotiation strategy by combining time-dependent strategy with association rules and finally, we verify model’s feasibility and effectiveness by experiment II  B ILATERAL M ULTI I SSUE N EGOTIATION M ODEL  The formal description of ARNM An Association Rulebased Negotiation Model\ defined as follow ARNM=<A, T all I, V, RGM, S, P A represents the set of Agent, assuming

The abbreviation placed next as: rule generation mechanism RGM nd the same as above negotiation strategy S ill be discussed respectively in the following sections III  R ULE G ENERATION M ECHANISM  In bilateral multi-issue negotiation process, the values of issues may be interdependent. For example, two issues \(price and delivery time\ In the actual negotiation process when the price is higher, the delivery time may be shorter, whereas the delivery time may be longer. Therefore assuming j 004 represents a subset of j I  j j I 003\004 005 and 1 j nj s et set I  004 000    jjj isub isub isub dlvhv     is the value subinterval of issue i, and 1 jn j i sub i sub Dd    000   j isub d  003  j i D 005 where sub is just an identifier of each subinterval Using above assumptions, given 123  j jj j ss s I 003\004 004 004 005 s1, s2 s3 are different identifier of j 004 the characters of interdependence of issues are defined according to the following definitions Def.1 \(Interdependence if issues belong to 2 j s 004 whose values depend on these issues in 1 j s 004 then we define that 2 j s 004 is dependent on 1 j s 004 and use 12  j j s s 004=\004 to represent the association between 1 j s 004 and 2 j s 004 for 1 j j is I 003\002\004 we define j i I as a decisional issue and the corresponding value subintervals are defined as decisional value subintervals. At the same time, for 2 j j is I 003\002\004 we define  j i I as an associated issue and the corresponding value subintervals are defined as associated value subintervals. If 2 j s 004 is independent on 1 j s 004  we use 12  j j s s 004\006\004 to represent this relationship Def.2 \(Association Rule Given 12  j j s s 004=\004  1 j j is I 003\002\004 and 2 j j is I 003\002\004 the set of association rule 007 which generated by 1  j j s i I 004 is defined according to equation \(4   1    jj i i jnj j i i sub i sub I dd     004 007=\010 011 4 Where 1 1  nj j j i i sub sub n sub dd d       010=\012\012 000 represents the set of decisional value subintervals and   j isub d  represents the corresponding associated value subinterval; n is the number of issues in 1 j s 004  Assuming 013 is denoted as the set of association rule between subsets of I so 12  s s j 004=\004 013 represents the association rule set, which generated by 12  j j s s 004=\004 Given 1 j j is I 003\002\004  2 j j is I 003\002\004 and combining with Def.2 12  s s j 004=\004 013 defined according to equation \(5    12 1 1   jj jj ss si jnj i I j A  004=\004 004 013 007 002 000 5 Where n is the number of issues in 2 j s 004 According to equation \(5\the association rule base defined according to equation \(6  1  jnj jj ss Rules j A 014 014\014 014   013\002\003\004=\004\002 000  6 Where s and s’ are identifiers of different subset To achieve the construction of association rule base according to the interdependence of issues, we adapt KMeans algorithm to analyze the successful negotiation records from history. After cluster analyzing, we can get a number of associated data clusters, which are used to generate the corresponding rules. In this way, we initially build the association rule base. Where K-Means algorithm uses distance as the similarity evaluation. For example calculating the distance between multi-dimensional data points p 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p n 1 n is the number of dimensions and p 2 p 1 2 p 2 2 p n 2 fined according to equation\(7    1 1 2 1 2 1     n ii i i dis p p p p 015 015 016   000 7 Where 002 represents the weight of attribute; in the proposed model, let 002\030 2, we use the Euclidean distance calculation and cluster each data object to the corresponding cluster And K-Means algorithm uses squared error criterion function c E as a cluster criterion c E defined as equation \(8  2 1 j k c jpC j E ppivot 002  000¦\000 8 Where k is the number of clusters; p is the data object which belongs to the corresponding data cluster C j pivot j represents the center object of C j This iteration process repeated until each data object belongs to a particular cluster and the c E  does not change or become less than a certain threshold Through the above cluster analysis, we have initially built the rule base, but there maybe exist some redundant or unreasonable association rules in the rule base. Therefore, for further optimizing of the rule base, the calculation rules of association rules are defined according to the following definitions \(mainly for unitary interdependence of issues Def.2.1 \(Extendibility Rule Given rules   jj isub d 017  003 011       ii jj isub I I d   002\007 the corresponding associated value subinterval is        jjj i sub i sub i sub dlvhv    and the value interval of issue i’ is   j jj iii D LV HV  Therefore, according to the utility evaluation mechanism, we can extend the minimum or maximum of 017 s associated value subinterval if the evaluation values are increased by counteroffers\(equation\(1\\, then the association value subinterval will be extended as       j j isub isub i dlvHV    if the evaluation value is decreased by counter-offers\(equation\(2

then the association value subinterval will be extended as       jj isub i isub dLVhv     Assuming  12   ii jj j II 017\017  003\002\007 and 1,1 1 jj j i sub i sub dd 017    011  whose decisional value subinterval is 1 1  jj isub isub dlv     1  j isub hv  and the corresponding associated value subinterval is  1  1  1  jjj i sub i sub i sub dlvhv     2,2 jj isub d 017      2 j isub d  011 whose decisional value subinterval is 2 j isub d    2 2  jj isub isub lv hv  and the corresponding associated value subinterval is   2   2   2  jjj i sub i sub i sub dlvhv    So, the combinability rule and adjustability rule are defined as follows Def.2.2 \(Combinability  Rule When the associated value subinterval  1   2 jj isub isub dd    we can combine 1 j 017 with 2 j 017  to generate a rule 3,1,2 1  jj j j i sub i sub i sub dd d 017      011 000  Def.2.3 \(Adjustability Rule When the evaluation values are increased by counter-offers \(equation \(1\ and  1 j isub lv      2 j isub lv  if 1  2 jj isub isub lv lv    020 then adjust 2 j 017 s associated value subinterval to   2  1   2  jjj i sub i sub i sub dlvhv    if 2 j isub lv   1  2 jj isub isub lv hv    020 then adjust 2 j 017 s decisional value subinterval to 2 2 1  jjj isub isub isub dlvlv    When the evaluation values are decreased by counter-offers \(equation 2\\ and  1   2 jj i sub i sub hv hv     if 1  2 jj isub isub lv lv    021 then adjust 1 j 017 s associated value subinterval to  1  1   2  jjj isub isub isub dlvhv     if 1  2 jj isub isub lv lv    020  1 j isub hv  then adjust 1 j 017 s decisional value subinterval to 1 1 2   jjj isub isub isub dlvlv      In summary, the rule generation mechanism \(RGM consists of 2 parts: the first part, cluster analysis algorithm used to analyze the successful negotiation records from history to initialize the association rule base; the second part using the calculation rules to merge and optimize the association rules for further perfect the construction of the association rule base IV  N EGOTIATION S TRATEGY  In the proposed model, time-dependent strategy combined with association rules to present an association rule-based time-dependent strategy.

Then we can generate counter-offers for the given time by using \(equation \(12 V  M ODEL A NALYSIS AND E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  The simulation model was implemented by Eclipse platform for achieving the interaction of bilateral multi-issue negotiation process. The comparison model is ANM \(an Agenda-based Negotiation Model\ which adapts the thought from the literatur nd negl e c t s t h e i n te rde pe nde nc e o f  issues. Assuming the set of issues I= {price, delivery time quality time in which the value of delivery time and the value of quality time are dependent on the value of price At the same time we assume each issue’s value interval is continuous and the corresponding weight is W 0.4, 0.2 0.4}. This discussion focuses on seller, so the seller’s parameters are set as follows price 3000, 450  delivery time 3  quality time 180,7  002\034 0.1 and T all 300 Finally, we set K-Means parameter k 20.

CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK 


 Web Usage Mining have been used in improving Web site design and marketing decision support, user profiling, and Web server system performance. Web page prediction technique is a very important role in web technologies. This paper proposes efficient algorithms for web path recommendation based on Weighted Association Rule. Two factors frequency and time spent were used to decide the web path traversal. The experimental results show that in the proposed approach when we increase the number of parameters for finding the web path the accuracy of the system is enhanced drastically and FTPW produces more accurate results than those achieved by FPW In the future, we shall improve the Web Path Traversal by considering the parameter Data Transfer Rate to provide the accurate Web Path traversal REFERENCES 1] M.
