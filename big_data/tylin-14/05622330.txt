INTRODUCTION With the popularity of the Internet and e-business, ecommerce system provides users with more choices.At the same time, its structure becomes more complex, users often lost in the information space of a large number of goods and can not successfully find their own needed goods. Ecommerce recommendation system directly interact with users to help customers find their own needed goods and successfully complete the purchase process by simulating the shop sales staff to recommendatie goods. Under the increasingly competitive market environment, e-commerce 


recommendation system can preserve the user and prevent users from loss, may change visitors of e-commerce web site into buyers, increase cross-selling ability of e-commerce web site, enhance customers loyalty degree to the site, thereby improve the sales of e-commerce systems. Recommendation system in e-commerce has good prospects of development and application. With the further expansion of the scale of ecommerce systems, however e-commerce recommendation systems also face the recommendation low accuracy and weak timeliness problems in providing personalized product recommendation services to their customer Web mining is the application of data mining technologies on the Internet to extract interesting, useful patterns and implicit information from activities related to WWW. Web mining technique is introduced to e-commerce recommendation system, by means of data mining technology to be used for automatically, quickly discovering the visitor's browsing patterns \(eg. frequent access web page groups, user groups, etc visitor's browsing patterns, the site can efficiently and automaticly dynamic adjust web pages content, and recommend right items for each customer to provide personalized recommendation service. With the personalized goods recommendation service e-commerce system attracts more visitors  II. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OF E-COMMERCE Personalized recommendation system of e-commerce uses the technology of Web log mining to obtain the user's access patterns from the Web logs. And based on user access tendency the site can provide a real-time view of the adaptive web pages that might interest the user. The system mainly consists of two implementation modules[1][2]: off-line and on-line A.  off-line module This module is mainly responsible for discovering the web site visitor browsing patterns from the web site log files filtering these patterns, establishing user clustering groups and finally obtaining recommended model library. The procedure is shown in Figure 1

On-line module Real-time recommendation engine recognizes the user's current session, obtains each user's current access sequence then the sequence will be loaded into the model library Real-time recommendation engine outputs the next possible goods web page accessed by the users. The web page's URL can be attached to the bottom of the current use. The procedure is shown in Figure 2   Figure 2.  The procedure of On-line module III. THE PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS PROCESS IN E-COMMERCE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM The off-line part of personalized recommendation system of e-commerce mainly uses the technology of web log mining. Users log information of commercial activity and browsing access in the web site is recorded in the log file The so-called log refers to the  variety of related Web log files about users access on the web server, including access logs, reference logs, agent logs, error logs and other documents. These files contain a large amount of information about a user accessing to the web server, such as the user's IP address, visited URL, access date and time access methods \(GET or POST success failure, error The typical Web server logs include the following information c-IP Address: IP address of the user that access the web server user ID \(cs-username need for user authentication only, without any certification of a page, was empty s-ip: IP address of the server being accessed s-port: the port is accessed to the server cs-method: refers to the way of user to access, for example, GET or POST; some also recorded the use of protocols such as http or ftp and so on cs-url: is visiting the web page\(Uniform Resource 


Locator sc-status: the final visited state \(results values are:200 means successful access,404 means  the requested page is not found Size: is the size of requested page Referer: are the Refering page.When a web browser follows a link from one page to another \(or even to a graphic is called the Refering page cs \(User-Agent and running operating system The following is a web server log snippet of a commercial web site on 2009-10-29 2009-10-29 00:03:51 220.156.32.79 - 220.156.35.1 80 GET /movie/movie.asp page=1&movietypes=all 200 Mozilla/4.0+\(compatible;+MSIE+6.0;+Windows+NT+5.0 2009-10-29 00:03:51 220.156.32.79 - 220.156.35.1 80 GET /movie/images/filmtop.gif - 200 Mozilla/4.0+\(compatible;+MSIE+6.0;+Windows+NT+5.0 2009-10-29 00:03:51 202.196.32.79 - 202.196.35.1 80 GET /movie/filmtop_jc.gif - 200 Mozilla/4.0+\(compatible;+MSIE+6.0;+Windows+NT+5.0 Although different users may have different browsing patterns at different times, but generally its long-term trend is stable. Web log mining from web log can find the browsing patterns that the user access web pages, find out the regularity, further through statistical analysis identify similarities and associated user groups, and the intrinsic relations between web pages. So as to improve site performances, organizational structure, and the quality and efficiency to find information for the users Web log mining process can be divided into two stages[3]: data preprocessing and log mining algorithms executing. When algorithms are executed, user interest patterns and user clustering are obtained A.  Data pre-processing Data pre-processing is a fundamental stage of web log mining. Usually, it makes the original log files into a user session through a series of data processing operations, such as data cleaning, user identification, session identification and so on Data cleaning mainly filters out irrelevant or redundant 


items. For example: In a log file,. Gif,. Ico,. Css,. Jpg segments can be deleted, which should not have impact on mining analysis results. For another example, usually a counter script file "count.cgi" in the home page also can be deleted User identification is an important part of web log mining and its success is directly related to the accuracy of mining results. User identification also is base of users cluster analysis and personalized recommendation service The purpose of session identification is to divide the users browsing access into different conversations. The easiest way is the time-window approach, through which if the interval of two browsing accesses from a user is over a certain time threshhold, we think that the user started another session. In actually running, we use 30 minutes as the default time window B.  Implementation of Data Mining Algorithms In recommendation technology, a key issue is to determine the right data mining algorithms, and a reasonable method can meet e-commerce applications requirements Algorithms proposed by researcher include: association rules clustering, collaborative recommendation technology [4][5 and so on. This paper discusses the clustering technology [6 to deal with browsing information for personalized recommendations 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling \(ICCASM 2010 V12-409 For processing e-commerce web site topology and user's browsing information, the UserID-URL associated matrix is established, with UserID \(user's IP address commerce Web site URL page for columns, and the element value is the user number of access page. On this basis, we can cluster the row vector to find similar user groups, the colomn vector analysis to identify the list of similar pages further the frequent page set \(frequent access path found 1 We denote Web server logs as L = <ip,url,time> after a certain pre-processing on logs, where ip, url, time representing web access user, the page is requested to access and the corresponding browse time respectively 2 


According to the log information, We can set up the following UserID-URL associated matrix    where hi,j is the browse residence time that the user i visits the first j pages \(URL means the situation of the site's pages\(URL the user; Each column vector means the situation that all users visits on this page \(URL reflects the user type, and also sketches out the user's personalized access. The column vector represents the structure of the site, also contains a common user access patterns. So similar users group \(ie the same type of users can be obtained directly by the similarity from row vectors and the recommended pages can be obtained from other similar users in the group to visit page 3 Similarity measure between vectors can be calculated by the hamming distance. First of all in the UserID-URL associated matrix, if the element Mi, j> 0 \(hi,j >0 hold, and the purpose of such handling simplifies the computational complexity. We dont consider the user's residence time in the past page but consider whether the user visited this page. Then, the hamming distance between vectors can be calculated. Smaller hamming distance means higher similarity Following is Hamming distance definition Set X, Y is a vector of  only 0 or 1, then the hamming distance Hd \(X, Y formula    1    x i iid YXYXH  \(1 Suppose vector X = \(1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1 1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0, 0,0,0,1 


and user Y to access the 12 pages respectively. From which we can find that user X browses the six pages of 1,3,4,5,7,12 and the user Y browses the five pages of 1,3,4,7,12. There is only one different access page between the two users, then we can directly perceive that the two users is similar. The result of 1 calculated by hamming distance formula means the highest degree of similarity between them. If the vector Y = \(0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0 different completely from the user X, on the contrary, the result of 12 is calculated by hamming distance formula, and means that they not have similarities 4 User clustering will firstly pre-process the UserID-URL associated matrix, if the element Mi, j> 0,  Mi, j = 1 is hold And then the hamming distance between row vectors is calculated in order to establish the new distance matrix Dm*m between the row vectors. In the symmetric distance matrix Dm*m , the element di,j represents the first i row vector with the first j row vectors of the hamming distance, and the value of diagonal elements is 0 in the new distance matrix Dm*m Then the size of threshold about user similarity calculated according to the following formula   m i m j ji mm dA 1 1   2  \(2 If di,j<A, the user i and all users j which meet the conditions will be dropped into a cluster \(users group Applying the above data mining algorithms, We obtain the result of clusters \(users group online module of e-commerce recommendation system finds that the online access user i is in a cluster \(users group the system can recommend the goods which other users in this cluster browsed to the user i, to achieve the objective of 


personalized goods recommendation. Because we believe that a cluster \(users group goods. Of course we will enable the enterprise provide personalized information services and targeted e-commerce activities to customers IV. CONCLUSION This paper introduces the UserID-URL associated matrix according to log information, and the mthod is simple and easy to improve the nature of algorithm,without the candidate set of Apriori algorithm in association rules. We calculate UserID-URL associated matrix and Distance matrix to cluster users into groups, and recommend effectively personalized recommend goods to which the user may prefer. The method also may enable enterprises offer personalized information services and e-commerce activities to customers, and increase the merchandise sales on ecommerce site REFERENCES 1]  Shi Jing.

calculating the weight for each web page for respective web site. The proposed approach uses Visiting Frequency and Time Spent on a Web page as two parameters to measure the weight of each web page To estimate the performance of the proposed two algorithms i.e. FPW and FTPW, discussed in section IV based on the above parameters involved in estimation C. Experimental Results The performance of the proposed approach can be evaluated by comparing the performance of FPW and FTPW algorithms which differ in number of parameters considered for experimentation. The comparison is made by taking the attribute like Visiting Frequency in FPW, and further Visiting Frequency and Time spent on a web page are clubbed together in FTPW as another attribute. The experimental setup uses five users and weights are plotted against various parameters Figure 2 shows the plot of Visiting Frequency v/s Weight of a web page              Figure 2: Plot between frequency and weight Algorithm: FTPW Input: Web traversal path database Output: Weight for each page 1 Calculate PageRank for each page \(PRi 3 2 Initially Set W\(Pi 3 Check the user is registered or not, if YES then 4       whether the user is first time visitor, if YES then 5  return W\(Pi 6    else 7      calculate FW\(Pi 4

CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK 


 Web Usage Mining have been used in improving Web site design and marketing decision support, user profiling, and Web server system performance. Web page prediction technique is a very important role in web technologies. This paper proposes efficient algorithms for web path recommendation based on Weighted Association Rule. Two factors frequency and time spent were used to decide the web path traversal. The experimental results show that in the proposed approach when we increase the number of parameters for finding the web path the accuracy of the system is enhanced drastically and FTPW produces more accurate results than those achieved by FPW In the future, we shall improve the Web Path Traversal by considering the parameter Data Transfer Rate to provide the accurate Web Path traversal REFERENCES 1] M.
