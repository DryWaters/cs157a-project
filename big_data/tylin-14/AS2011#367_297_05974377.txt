related to items with low supports, it is bound to miss association rules related to important items with low supports Because it only takes support into consideration, but does not involve other natures of items III. A FUZZY WEIGHT ALGORITHM WITH MULTIPLE SUPPORTS FOR MINING ASSOCIATION RULES In order to overcome disadvantage of the algorithm above, based on MSM algorithm, we present a new algorithmfuzzy weight algorithm with multiple supports for mining association rules, which is named FWMSM algorithm for short. Compared with MSM algorithm FWMSM algorithm takes support and significance into consideration at the same time. Significance, which involves multi-attribute of an item, represents the importance of an item. Some attributes are quantitative and others are not quantitative but only a fuzzy conception Fuzzy-comprehensive evaluation, making use of fuzzy set theory, can be applied in evaluating complex objects with multi-attribute [9]. Therefore, fuzzy-comprehensive evaluation can be used to compute significance of items. To an evaluation problem, following parameters are involved evaluation factor set U{u1,u2,,um}, evaluation set V v1,v2,,vn}, evaluation factor weight b{W1,W2,,Wm Process of fuzzy-comprehensive evaluation can be described as follows: \(1 2 computing fuzzy product of UV; \(3 every element in evaluation set, c {c1,c2, ,cn}; \(4 computing significance. Through the process, significance of the kth item can be transformed to a numerical value signif\(ik reflect multiple natures of items. So it can be used as weight value in FWMSM algorithm Similar to MSM algorithm, in FWMSM algorithm minimum support is still the threshold to judge whether an itemset in Ck can be put into Lk. Assuming the kth item is marked as ik, I= {i1,i2,i3,, im} represents an itemset; MIS\(ik represents minimum support of ik; sup\(ik support of ik; and signif\(ik Assuming the ith transaction is marked as ti, ti= <TID, T TID represents transaction No., n represents the number of transactions in the transaction database, and T I? . Only if sup   


k k k k i I i I n i MIS i  can it be put into large itemsets. FWMSM algorithm can be described as follows  Algorithm: FWMSM algorithm Input: a transaction database, MIS\(I I Output: maximum large itemset 1. k= l 2.

Return Ct In FWMSM algorithm, from the third row to the seventh row, L1 is produced. M represents items that users are concerned with in the transaction database. From the tenth row to the eighteenth row, L is produced. In order to reduce scan time, Ct is used to analyze whether Ck exists in Lk-1. In the eighteenth row, large itemsets produced before is saved Procedures of Generate_candidate  deal with reduction of candidate itemsets and related subsets IV. EXPERIMENTS: THE CASE OF FWMSM ALGORITHM In order to illuminate FWMSM algorithm more clearly in this section we will use a case to analyze it. Taking commodity X for example, we will demonstrate the process of computing significance. For every commodity businessmen not only attach importance to its profit, but also pay attention to brand effect and other soft profits. When we use fuzzy-comprehensive evaluation to compute significance of X, profit and brand effect can be chosen as evaluation factor set, U= {profit, brand effect}. Of course we can also choose other factors to constitute evaluation factor set. Evaluation set consists of five evaluation grade, V excellent, good, common, bad, awful}. The weight value of profit and brand effect can be marked as a {0.85, 0.15 At last, a quantitative value for every element in evaluation set is given, c {1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1}. We can assume 20 percent of X have bad grade\b profit, 80 percent of X have awful grade\b profit: A profit \(0/excellent, 0/good 


0/common, 0.2/bad, 0.8/awful 0.1/excellent, 0.2/good, 0.5/common, 0.1/bad, 0.1/awful So we can get a fuzzy matrix 0 0 0 0.2 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.5 0.1 0.1 R   The comprehensive evaluation of X can be described as follows: b= aR= \(0.015, 0.03, 0.075, 0.185, 0.695 significance of X can be described as follows: d= cbT 0.1985 Commodity information and transaction records in the transaction database are described in table I and table II respectively Firstly, through scanning table II, we can compute the support of every commodity. Secondly, we compute the product of nsupport and significance of a commodity which is described in nsupportsignif column of table III Thirdly, for every item, comparing the values of nsupportsignif and MIS, if nsupportsignif ? MIS, the item is put into large itemsets. Similar to Apriori algorithm L1 is produced, and then, C2L2C3L3are produced subsequently. Finally, maximum large itemset contains {B C} and {B, E}. So association rules and their confidence can be described in table IV. Assuming minimum confidence is 60 two association rules are produced: CB and EB From the result, we can see commodity C, which has low support and high significance, is put into L2 and is contained in association rules. However, if we make use of ordinary MSM algorithm, those association rules containing C, will be missed TABLE I.  COMMODITY INFORMATION commodity No. significance MIS A 0.05 0.2 B 0.15 0.3 C 0.4 0.2 D 0.05 0.4 E 0.2 0.2

ASSOCIATION RULES association rules confidence BC 25 BE 50 CB 100 EB 66.7  V. CONCLUSION FWMSM algorithm can be used to produce subjectoriented, more useful association rules. It mainly has three characters: \(1 compute significance, which can comprehensively reflect natures of item with multi-attribute; \(2 large itemset is produced, support and significance are taken into consideration at the same time, making the filter criterion more reasonable; \(3 concerned with, important items with low support will not be missed easily ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Dr. Mao Hongbao and Dr. Xu Lei for the fruitful discussions leading to this work REFERENCES 1] Mehmed Kantardzic, Data Mining, Beijing: Tsinghua University Press, 2003 2] Wenwei Chen, Data Warehouse and Data Mining, Beijing: Posts

Next we applied equal interval binning with approximate values based on medical expert advice to Pima Indian diabetes data. Than we applied apriori association rule algorithm to generate the rules. The generalization of rule may be further improved by considering the factors which influence the diabetes. But which are not included in the present study.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
