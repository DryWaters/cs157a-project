But there are some problems in statistical data of it, such as untruth and shortage. The quality problems of statistical data 
of private economy have received more and more concern from the government and society. Association rules learning is a method of data mining. The article tries to use association rule learning to process statistical data of private economy and analyze the results to improve the quality of statistical data of private economy. Finally the article provides some exploratory comments and suggestions about the application of association rule mining in private economy statistics Keywords-data mining; private economy; association rules mining I  I NTRODUCTION  Private economy is a kind of non-public sectors of the 
economy. It is so adaptable and viable in the intense market competition that it becomes one of the most profitable economic sectors with a rapid development in the national economy and is playing more and more important part in the social and economic activities. As basic and important information, the statistical data of private economy have received more and more concern from the government and the quality problems of it have attracted extensive social attention Currently the statistical data of private economy are of low quality, and statistical information distortion has obsessed the statistical work. If we don’t take some necessary measures, it will exercise a great influence on accuracy of national economic accounting and misadvise the decision of economic work 
Association rule learning is a popular method of data mining, which finds out the valuable relationship between the data from the given data set. There is dependence relationship between the statistical data of private economy. According to the interaction between production, allocation, exchange and consumption, we could use association rule learning to find out some association characteristic among the statistical data of private economy and analyze it. We could judge the authenticity and pertinence of statistical data of private economy by finding something which doesn’t conform to economic laws or is full of contradiction. This article tries to apply association rule learning to statistics of private economy II  T HE BASIC CONCEPTS AND ALGORITHM OF 
ASSOCIATION RULE LEARNING  Let   12  m I ii i   be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let 12    m D tt t   be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I A rule is defined as an implication of the form AB where  AIBI  and AB 
 The sets of items A and B are called antecedent and consequent of the rule respectively The confidence of a rule is defined as confidence A B P B|A   The support of a rule is defined as support A B P A B    Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability P \(B | A\. Support can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability  P AB  Item set is defined as a set of items. K item set is a item set which contains k items. The support of a item set is defined as frequency of the item set, that is the number of 
transaction of database D which is the item set. If the support of a item set is larger than the user-specified minimum support multiplied by the number of transactions of database D we can say the item set satisfies the user-specified minimum support. The itemset which satisfies the user-specified minimum support is called frequent k-item set The support and confidence can be interpreted as utility and definitiveness of an association rule. Association rules are required to satisfy a user-specified minimum support and a user-specified minimum confidence at the same time. To achieve this, association rule generation is a two-step process First, minimum support is applied to find all frequent item 
sets in a database. In a second step, these frequent item sets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules While the second step is straight forward, the first step needs more attention  Apriori is a classic algorithm for learning association This article is sponsored by State Natural Sciences Fund project research of agency act and performance appraisal in the family firm 70972119\and State Statistics Bureau primary project “empirical research on quality influence factor of regional statistics data based on direct network report” \(2009LZ038 978-1-4244-8694-6/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 


  rules. It generates candidate item sets of length k from item sets of length k-1. Then it prunes the candidates which have an infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent k-length item sets. After that, it scans the transaction database to determine frequent item sets among the candidates III  E XAMPLE OF APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULES LEARNING IN DATA PROCESSING OF STATISTICS OF PRIVATE ECONOMY  The development of the economy in Zhejiang Province has been very fast since the nineties in last century. People generally regard private enterprises and capital as the important reasons. But we should notice that level of development of private economy varies greatly from city to city in Zhejiang Province. The data of table I prove it  TABLE I  INITIAL STATISTICAL DATA OF PRIVATE ECONOMY OF CITIES IN ZHEJIANG PROVINCE IN 2006 area gross product a hundred million RMB number of private enterprises ten thousand  capital a hundred million RMB  total retail sales of consumer goods a hundred million RMB Hang zhou 691.7 10.1 1870.4 278 Ning bo 1480.4 8.3 1132.8 361.2 Wen zhou 868.3 4.6 953.3 311.2 Jia xing 1193.7 3.4 473.2 269.9 Hu zhou 502.5 1.4 212.2 237.8 Shao xing 2026.8 3.5 613.4 175.3 Jin hua 846.6 3.6 735.2 242.4 Qu zhou 249.4 8.3 158.8 975.8 Zhou shan 271.3 6.4 121.3 607.7 Tai zhou 596.7 3.4 497.6 128.7 Li shui 173.5 9.1 168.5 32.6 data source: www.zj.stats.gov.cn  We can divide the cities in Zhejiang Province into three groups according to the level of gross product of private economy. The eleven cities are listed in order of gross product of private economy. The three high level cities are developed areas in private economy, gross product of which can be instead of A. The four middle ones are developing areas, gross product of which can be instead of B. The four low ones are underdeveloped areas, gross product of which can be instead of C. Because the geographical position, economic foundation and surroundings of each area is different, the other three indicators of the eleven cities are also very different. We need to calculate the average of each indicator separately and compare it with the amounts of cities. The logicals will be used to apply association rules    TABLE II  RESULTS OF INDICATOR CLASSIFICATION  area gross product a hundred million RMB number of private enterprises ten thousand capital a hundred million RMB total retail sales of consumer goods a hundred million RMB Hang zhou B 1 1 0 Ning bo A 1 1 1 Wen zhou B 0 1 0 Jia xing A 0 0 0 Hu zhou C 0 0 0 Shao xing A 0 0 0 Jin hua B 0 1 0 Qu zhou C 1 0 1 Zhou shan C 1 0 1 Tai zhou B 0 0 0 Li shui C 1 0 0 The average number of private enterprises is 56.5 thousand. The average of capital is 63061 million. The average of total retail sales of consumer goods is 32915 million. If the actual number is larger than average, we should replace it with 1. If the actual number is smaller than average we should replace it with 0 The objective of association rules application is to find out the relationship between the private economy indicators and classification results and the connection among the private economy indicators by processing the statistical data of private economy. If minimum support is specified 20%, that means the number is less than 2. Table 3 tells the computational and comparison process which uses Apriori algorithm  TABLE III   COMPUTATIONAL AND COMPARISON PROCESS BY APRIORI ALGORITHM I C I C 1 5 1,3 3 2 4   3 3   Firstly, scan all the items to obtain the counts of 1-item sets. All the accounts satisfy the minimum support. Secondly link 1-item sets to get 2-item sets and scan all the items again Then we can compare the counts of 2-item sets and delete the ones which don’t satisfy the minimum support According to the results above, we can know how the three indicators influence each classification result, namely the support. We can also find out the support from the three indicators as a whole    


  TABLE IV  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THREE INDICATORS AND EACH CLASSIFICATION RESULT I S\(I1,I\ S\(I2,I\ S\(I3,I\ S\(I1,,I2,I3,I A 33 33% 33 33 B 25 75% 0 0 C 75 0 50 0 Some explanation for the support of table IV   Four figures are equal to 0. The total retail sales of consumer goods of developing areas in private economy are all lower than average. The capitals of underdeveloped areas in private economy are all less than average. The areas whose three indicators all reaches average level can not be developing areas or underdeveloped areas in private economy   Usually the support of three indicators will reduce if the level of private economy is low. But when in developed areas developing areas underdeveloped areas, the support from number of private enterprises is 33 25 75 from capital is 33 75 0, from total retail sales of consumer goods is 33 0 50 This seems to be contradictory to our conclusion. In fact, this is in accordance with economic feature of Zhejiang Province. The support of three indicators as a whole is 33 0 0 which proves that aggregative indicator supports the classification well IV  CONCLUSION AND POLICIES REQUIRED BY APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION RULES IN STATISTICS OF PRIVATE ECONOMY  This article introduces the basic concepts of association rule learning and applies Apriori algorithm which produces association rules to statistics of private economy. Potential rules of development of private economy can be found out to supply valid information basis for decision-making work of private economy by processing the statistical data of private economy. What we should pay attention to is Apriori algorithm need to scan the data base repeatedly. But there are a lot of data in the statistics of private economy. Every candidate in the candidate set should be checked to determine frequent item sets. How to improve the algorithm and computing efficiency is a problem that we should resolve Besides, Apriori algorithm requires that the data in studied data base don’t change, but statistical data of private economy are usually updated. So the previous rules are not adaptive after the new data appear. If we apply association rules mining to the whole data base again, we have to do a lot of repeated work. It increases the computing intension and wastes the former mining results. At present, researchers have got many methods which can improve the computing efficiency of Apriori algorithm or can deal with the changed data, such as hash table technology, data division technology, sampling technology, and dynamic item set counting. These methods could reduce the number of scanning the data set and find new association rules in time to satisfy the need of decision and analysis. Meanwhile the statistics of private economy involve production, allocation, exchange and consumption and relation between the data is very complex, so association rules mining should be applied with other data mining technology to become an integrated scheme of data mining  In the present circumstances, if we want to enable the effective application of association rules mining and perform its role effectively, there are some conditions and policies to improve and establish. Therefore, before carrying out the work of association rules mining, we should make range of statistics of private economy and statistical content clear to be more objective about the size, industrial structure development speed and potential growth of private economy At the same time we should organize the training of statisticians, let them understand and grasp the use of data mining software, and be able to analyze the results of association rules mining It is a new method that association rules mining is applied to data processing of private economy statistics. This method could improve the quality of statistical data of private economy. Although some scholars have studied application of association rules mining, researches according to the actual needs about the application of association rules mining in private economy statistics are still rare. Appling association rules mining to the field of statistics of private economy will broaden the ideas and horizon of quality control theory research on statistical data of private economy. Besides, using association rules mining to excavate valuable information from a large amount of statistical data of private economy will help the government to make various private economic policies and promote the development of China's private economy R EFERENCES  1  M.

mining procedures. Our motivation in this study is to utilize the redundancy for extracting algorithm of fuzzy association rules IV. IMPROVEMENT OF APRIORI ALGORITHM BASED ON If max{Conf\(Z ? y X ? y max{CF\(Z ? y X ? y ZEQ Proof From the assumption, there exist P E Q that satisfY Con/\(P ? y X ? Y P ? y 0: CF\(X ? Y CF\(X ? y P ? Y Z ? V ZEQ 70 The necessary point in the Apriori algorithm for extracting association rules is to generate the frequent item sets efficiently Though the confidence of the association rules are calculated mally after all decision of frequent itemsets in traditional Apriori algorithm, the basic idea of our proposal is that the confidence of the rule can be calculated after each step A3 in the Apriori algorithm and used for pruning the redundant itemsets. The issue is to decide which itemset should be pruned utilizing the confidence information. Then we define "strong redundant rule" and "strong redundant itemset Confidence 1.0 2 3 4 The number of items Figure 2. Conceptual Diagram of Pruning Method Definition 2: Let X ? Y be a fuzzy association rule, where X and Yare fuzzy item sets. Let Q be Q = 2 x - X If min\(ConJ\(Z ?Y X ?Y ZEQ X ?

Since the Apriori algorithm generates the candidate itemsets in tum from l-itemsets, the pruning based 


on the redundancy should be performed simultaneously In addition to the basic Apriori algorithm, the following procedures are employed for k> I as A4 confidence of k-rule based on Lk and Lk.j AS The concept of the procedure is that the confidence value of rule should increase by increasing the number of antecedent items. In other words, the procedure is based on valid heuristics that the combination of items in antecedent part which deteriorates the confidence value will become redundant in the following iterations. We can expect reduction of computational time and redundant rules pruning by the additional procedures It should be noted that the confidence calculation in each iteration does not lead to the increase of overall calculation time in association rules mining v. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES We develop the fuzzy mining system based on the redundancy pruning and evaluate the proposed algorithms through numerical examples. We apply the system to "abalone data" available from the vcr Machine Learning Repository[7 The abalone data set consists of 4177 measured data with 1 nominal attribute and 8 continuous attributes as shown in 71 Table. I. In the experiments, the nominal attribute is transformed to the continuous attribute. Table 2\(a statistics and the fuzzy partition information of attributes are summarized in Table 2\(b wider than the actual data distribution for performance evaluation. The fuzzy partition example is shown in Fig.3. We use two types of fuzzy sets with different width, i.e. triangle type and trapezoid type. Although it is better to use the factor such as "interesting" for pruning the derived rules in addition we apply the native association rule extraction for proposed algorithm evaluation.

The number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm Fig.5 shows the results of reduction of itemsets by the proposed algorithm. We can see that fair itemsets are pruned by the proposed method. Fig.6 shows the number of extracted rules by the conventional Apriori algorithm. Many redundant rules are extracted as well as the necessary non-redundant rules Our issue is to restrain the extraction of redundant rules. Fig.7 shows the results of the number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm. Some redundant rules are deleted simultaneously along with frequent itemsets extraction However, since a few non-redundant rules are also unexpectedly deleted at the lower threshold value of minimal confidence, we have to investigate further about heuristics, i.e strong redundant itemsts and relation of threshold values. It should be noted that the number of deleted rules has less dependence on the minimal confidence These results are promising in terms of computational time and redundant rules pruning. However, the improvement is limited in terms of computational time. We consider that the performance of the proposed method must be improved by applying the output field specification method[17]. We expect that the number of pruned rules becomes larger based on the specifications. Moreover, the other measures to prevent redundant rules extraction in fuzzy association rules mining 


could be applied as well as the proposed algorithm VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules extracted. We also proved the redundancy defmition of the rule based on the CF\(certainty factor algorithm was evaluated through numerical experiments using benchmark data, "Abalone". From the results, the method was found to be promising in terms of computational time and redundant rule pruning. Our future plan includes sophistication of the proposed algorithm, application to the huge data mining problem, and further improvement of fuzzy association rules mining REFERENCES I] R.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
