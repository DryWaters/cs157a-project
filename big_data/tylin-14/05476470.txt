A Model for the Development of NFC ContextAwareness Applications on Internet of Things  Pilar Castro Garrido, Guillermo Matas Miraz, Irene Luque Ruiz, Miguel ngel Gmez-Nieto Department of Computing and Numerical Analysis University of Crdoba Crdoba, Spain pcgarrido@uco.es, gmatas@uco.es, iluque@uco.es, mangel@uco.es    Abstract In this paper a model for the development of contextawareness applications using Near Field Communication is presented. The model is based in the association of services and resources to augmented objects through Tags. The different types of services assigned to the objects are modeled in a hierarchy defining the execution order and personalizing the user interaction through the use of resources and rules. A tool for the testing and validation of the model has been developed and is described in the paper together with an application example Keywords- Context-awareness, Phone Mobile, NFC, Internet of Things I. INTRODUCTION Future of Internet seems as a fully connected world through hidden connected computer linked to also connected augmented objects: from books, cars, house machines, foods to anything. From the Weiser vision [1] of this world some ubiquitous computing paradigms [2] have been proposed for the development of applications able to build the Internet of Things \(IoT  IoT should not be seen as a simple extension of the current Internet, but as a set of new interdependent systems that operate with their own infrastructures. Therefore, IoT would be set up together with new services, as is stated in a report from the Information Society Technology Advisory Group \(ISTAG 4 IoT supports the idea of a context where the objects are augmented by Tags. Those Tags store encoded information under a standard format or at least on a format known by the objects/devices that interact with them, with the objective of gathering information and services. Pending on the interaction model, IoT is based on the use of different paradigms, being 


undoubtedly the Touch Paradigm [5] one of the most attractive of all. Recent investigations are focused on make those services and systems offered by IoT aware of the context Context awareness is referred to the capability of an application or a system to be aware of its physical environment and the situation in order to be able to act and answer in a proactive and intelligent way [6], [7]. Building upon the context acquisition and context management models discussed in literature, numerous context management architectures have been proposed [8]-[10]. Although many EU projects [11]-[13 and industrial research [14], [15] have explored contextawareness aspects, however the proposed approaches fail to completely offer a generic, scalable and flexible architecture supporting both evolving context models and evolving services and applications. Moreover, an efficient context diffusion and coherent integration into mobile communication services continues to be a challenging research area A. NFC in the development context-awareness IoT Lately, different ubiquitous applications have been proposed making use of NFC \(Near Field Communication payment applications, ticketing and loyalty [16], tourism location and surfing [17], elderly and home assistance \(AAL 18], building intelligent ambient where it has been studied how to make the context sensitive to the user interaction with the scenario [19], [20 The interaction with the objects from a scenario could be more or less complex regarding some parameters as the type of sensor: whether is active \(it has its own autonomous power to the object The active objects have some processing capability, either by themselves, or because they are connected directly to any system with this capability \(as can be a reader connected through the net with a central server type of objects could be easily customized, with the intelligence of the process relying over the Back-end system that stores information about the scenario, users, devices, etc and the logic that allows adapting the interaction to the characteristics of the scenario, users and interactions. Passive objects simply store information that would be read by the user device, being his/her device, through the appropriate software, the one that would guide the interaction, initiating 


the needed actions. Although in several environments, mainly closed, intelligent scenarios could be built making use of active objects; in open scenarios and other applications, the objects are passive, being augmented with Tags The user interaction in augmented scenarios with passive objects is normally based on: a Second International Workshop on Near Field Communication 978-0-7695-3998-0/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/NFC.2010.8 9 his/her NFC device the Tag associated to the object, b device receives the information stored in the Tag c software installed in the device would read the information and execute the corresponding action. Evidently, in this case any user interacts with the objects in the scenario in the same way, either his/her characteristics, preferences or previous interactions were If the mobile device has a software \(MIDlet information stored in the Tag could be far more complex and the actions executed by the MIDlet could be far more complex that those established by the NFC-Forum standard and specifications. In this case, the intelligence in the interaction could be carried out by: a with the mobile device through some of the available media WLAN, GPRS, Bluetooth, etc both systems In the first case, the NFC device would act as terminal sending the information of the Tag to the Back-end system which would perform its processing, answering the user in a proper and customized way. The main issue of those systems lies in its cost, security and reliability of the communication in open environments with user mobility and communication losses In this paper we propose a solution for scenarios formed by passive Tags that allow complex interactions with the user and where the interaction is organized mainly by the mobile device having the Back-end system none or little responsibility Within those intelligent environments different scenarios could be defined, having different objects, where each scenario would behave in a different way regarding the user that interacts with it, his preferences, his characteristics and even his devices characteristics 


II. A MODEL FOR THE NFC SERVICES DEFINITION The objective of our work is to propose and define a model that allows the interaction with a scenario formed by augmented objects, and which is able to allow different interaction contexts defined by the user characteristics and preferences A. Definitions and basis of the model Being a scenario S defined by a group of objects O = {o1 o2, , on} that have assigned a set of Tags T = {t1, t2, , tn where t1 ? o1, t2 ? o2  , tn ? on. For each Tag ti a set of services Vij \(j = 1..m oi can be defined Being C = {c1, c2, , cn} the set of different interaction contexts that are defined for a scenario S, and U = {u1, u2 un} the set of users that interact with the scenario S as per a certain interaction context ci As shown in Fig. 1, in each context ci a subset equal or different to the set of objects O that form the scenario S can actuate, offering the same or different set of services V\(u the users ui that interact with the scenario S In Fig. 1 it is shown how the two users interact with, as an example, the object o2 from the scenario, however the object o2, can offer the same or different services v2i to each user, and those services are executed as per the user preferences customizing the interaction of the users with the context Figure 1. An example of  user interaction with scenario objects Therefore, besides those elements described, the proposed model is characterized by offering a logic or procedures that ease and make intuitive the interaction of the users with the context. This logic establishes the behavior that is offered by the objects in the scenario and how those objects are going to answer to the different users. Thus, regarding the user that interacts within the same context, the interaction with the scenario could be different and adapted to the user In order to define the behavior of the objects and how the set of services vij associated to each of them is going to be executed pending of the user, a set of rules R = {r1, r2, , rn is defined. Each one of these rules give the logic needed for the interaction between the intelligent object of the context and the user, allowing the customization of the context ci to different users ui The rules establish a customized processing logic in the 


interaction of the users with the objects. This customization is supported by a set of resources D = {d1, d2, , dn} which characterize the way or media used to carry out the interaction user-context and how that communication will be performed Figure 2. Elements of a interaction context 10 As can be seen in Fig. 2, each object has associated a set of services that can be offered to the user. Those services can be associated to the actions that would happen when the user touches the Tag, matching the expectations. Whether one service or other is executed is defined by the rules defined for determine the interaction model with the user and therefore, as per the user characteristic and interaction preferences Different types of services can be defined: a use of URIs \(Uniform Resource Identifier performing actions such as sending a mail \(mailto phone call \(tel http sms starting an application, etc., b installed in the mobile device, and c lies on the Back-end system The interaction with the objects is defined by the resources created to that purpose. The resources allow the customization of the NFC device so the interaction is carried out in the best and most intuitive way and as per the preferences defined; i.e through a resource a device can be ordered to vibrate, or to play a sound, voice or image in order to start the associated operative Figure 3. Services hierarchical structure Obviously, the use of the resources associated to the objects is limited to the characteristics of the own device that is part of the interaction. The resources can be assigned to the Tags and to the different services defined for the Tags. A resource associated to the Tag is executed in the moment that the user interacts with the Tag \(touches it to the services are executed during the service operation and ends up in any of the following situations: a finishes, b with the user finishes As can be seen in Fig. 3, those services are defined within a priority structure defined by the level of service definition in the hierarchical structure. The first service that is going to be executed is the Service 1 


For that, the service will check based on its properties, rules and preferences defined and the resources needed whether it can or should instantiate it. If the execution is properly done, it will continue executing the services of the same level of the tree. It a service cannot be executed or an error occurred, the execution will go down a level in the structure, in order to process the subordinated services \(Service 2.1, Service 2.2 etc subordinated, the next service level to be executed will be the corresponding to the directly upper level, that is, Service 3 III. NFC SCENARIOS CREATOR With the purpose of testing the functionality and utility of the interaction model described, a tool named NFC Scenarios Creator \(NFCSC developed in Java for the scenario definition under the model described and that integrates the use of them to be understood by a MIDlet that will be executed in a NFC device NFCSC allows, therefore, the definition of the scenario rules and user interaction preferences; it also has the capability both of recording the Tags associated to the objects in the scenario as of generating the contents needed for a proper performance of the MIDlet Although NFCSC is still in development stage, the system allows to establish the hierarchy of functionalities associated to each object and to define restrictions and preferences NFCSC \(Fig. 4 scenarios or projects. For each project a set of identifying attributes are defined, as well as the objects that compose the scenario, the services associated to the objects, the general and user interactions preferences and the resources used on it Each scenario is described by a XML document, as shown in the DTD file from Chart I  CHART I. DTD FOR THE SCENARIO DEFINITION xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8 ELEMENT XMLProject \(XMLDescription, XMLPath XMLResource*, XMLTag ATTLIST XMLProject ID CDATA #REQUIRED name CDATA #REQUIRED ELEMENT XMLTag \(XMLDescription, XMLResource XMLService

So when an object is detected the services to be offered can be defined and also the way to execute them. Herewith, together with the installation or deployment of an application, the initial XML file of the project is also stored in the device being the processing of that file by the MIDlet the one that really defines the interaction The user can modify the XML file making use of the MIDlet, adjusting the parameters that define the interaction model \(properties and resources a user that in the scenario definition decided that when touching a certain object an action started automatically, could modify that decision converting it to manual afterwards, or activate/deactivate the vibration when touching a Tag, simply by changing the values of the corresponding properties in the XML file As can be seen in Chart I, each project is defined by a 


unique name and identifier, a description, and a set of Tags assigned which characterize the scenario together with a set of resources. The Tag identifier includes the scenario identifier which allows the MIDlet of the device to reach the XML document that has to been used in order to guide the interaction For each Tag one or several services could be defined and one or several resources could be associated to them. The services could be defined in a recursively way, which allows specifying the execution hierarchy aforementioned. For each service a set of attributes is defined, those attributes define their activation and execution mode The resources used in the interaction should also be stored in the device, so, together with the definition and, pending of the type it is possible to: define its content \(XMLContent specify the path where it is stored in the device \(SMLPath Figure 4. NFC Scenario Creator main interface As can be seen in Fig. 4, the NFCSC interface is divided in some sections. The left sidebar presents the different projects scenarios of the projects represented as the root of the tree, while the Tags assigned to each scenario are added as if they were their leaves. The system allows to edit the information of the elements from each scenario, both the Tags and the own project Pending of which element is selected among the project tree, the content of the central panel would be different. For each project the system allows to introduce a general description, as well as to assign the general resources used If a Tag is chosen, the possibilities offered by the system change, allowing: a management, c associated to the services, and d among the execution hierarchy established NFCSC has an event viewer \(frame placed under the main pane the system during the interaction with the user. Each entry in the event viewer is composed by the time when that event happened and a description that allow the user to know the action that has been performed. Thanks to this log the edition or step back in the scenario building is easier IV. AN EASY EXAMPLE. EMERGENCIES AND ASSISTANCE 


SYSTEM With the aim of showing the characteristics of the proposed model and the tool built, its application to a very simple example will be described with the purpose of not including an extension and complexity not needed  Figure 5. Emergencies and assistance example The basic idea of this scenario is that any user in urgency could ask for help in an easy, quick and intuitive way, just by touching with their NFC device an image with a Tag associated. Chart II shows a fragment with the definition of the scenario described As shown in Fig. 5, the scenario is formed by a frame where, in order to represent the emergency, a picture of an ambulance has been placed. Behind the ambulance there is a Tag. Where the device is got close to the Tag placed in the frame: a the MIDlet retrieves and decode the content in order to identify the scenario, c XML file and its resources, d corresponding action and services and, e ends up the application The full definition of the XML file that specifies the interaction in this simple example contains two services: a phone call to the emergencies number, and b message to two relatives, both making use of multiple device 12 resources. However, and for keeping it short, Chart II only shows a partial view of the example, showing only the definition of the general properties of the Tag as well as the first two services and some examples of resource use As shown in Chart II, the Tag has defined the use of two resources. First one is associated to the vibration of the device while the second is about an information text that will be displayed to the user when starting the interaction CHART II.

In this case is a tel URI. This service makes use of an audio resource whose content it stored on the device storage. In future versions it will be implemented with a voice synthesizer Notice how the following service definition, corresponding to sending a sms, is indented from the previous one. This 


means that the service is in the same branch, but at a lower level in the hierarchy of services execution. Therefore, this service will only be conducted if an error has occurred in the execution of the previous one. As shown in chart II the latter service uses an image resource in charge of showing some information at the MIDlet display and whose content is also stored on the device Besides, the MIDlet allows in a simple way to modify all those parameters that define the execution of the services and their use. As commented before, a user could not want that a service is executed automatically and requires manual confirmation. For that, he/she only would need to change the value of the execution parameter of the service into manual. In the same way, the user can activate or deactivate the use of resources just by modifying the value of the state attribute into off. Even more, it is possible to add new resources, if, together with their definition some content needed for their execution is included Therefore, it can be checked as, even when the user define an initial interaction for a scenario and even when the same deployment is done in different devices, each user could easily adapt and customize the interaction to its needs and preferences afterwards Equally, the user could activate or deactivate a service changing the execution order and modifying the hierarchy initially defined for them. Herewith, the same scenario could be customized and act in a different way depending of the person that interacts with it V. DISCUSSION IoT is not a reality yet, but a prospective view of a series of technologies that, combined, could sharply modify the interaction mode with our environment and the working of our society in the following years. In order to establish the IoT philosophy, it would be needed an advance of the development and dissemination of elements as sensors, new communication technologies \(as well as their intercommunication mobile devices able to integrate them, a proper infrastructure and above all software applications that supports them and are able to integrate all those elements, as well as to fulfills the needs and requirements of the users Those new systems must also be adapted to the different interaction scenarios and, mainly, to the different 


characteristics, requirements, preferences and needs of the people that interact with the environment. In this paper we present a model that provides a solution to this issue The model is based in augment different objects among a scenario with Tags, by the assignment of services and resources defined in an abstracted hierarchy that allows configuring a customized interaction model. Thus, for the same scenario, the model is able to define different interaction contexts. So, a context is defined as the aggregation of: a certain scenario formed by a set of intelligent objects offering a set of services, b characteristics, preferences and needs, c and d Under the proposed model a tool that allows the definition and scenario deployment has been built. A neuter MIDlet installed in the NFC device is the one in charge of guiding the 13 interaction through the definition of the scenarios stored in a XML file. This architecture allows that the same MIDlet could be used with any scenario and that the user could adapt the interaction to his preferences Currently we are working in the completeness of the model and the complex interaction scenarios generalization, being the latter based in rules systems that allows adapting the different interaction contexts to the users ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain \(MICINN Project TIN2009-07184 REFERENCES 1] M.

dataset contains a stream of TCP connection records from two weeks of LAN traffic over MIT Lincoln Labs. It consists of 42 attributes that usually characterize network traffic behavior, both categorical attributes and quantitative attributes such as duration of the connections, protocol type etc. Attribute src_byte denoting the number of data bytes from source to destination and attribute dst_bytes inverse are selected in this experiment.  They are both quantitative attributes The user specified parameters are set as follows 5, 0.3, 0.03, 0.01,W min_sup preMinsup T 0.5, 0.4, 30.min_confidence max_MFB min_num_triples And the number of transactions in each time slot is 250 It is assumed that there are no more than three fuzzy sets or intervals in the datasets i.e. 3F Four different approaches to mine association rules are compared using the following notations: Fuzzy+MFB: the approach that use both fuzzy method and MFB_measure with 1 3.0? = and 2 0 .5 2 0.5? = , Fuzzy+P: the approach using fuzzy method with 1 3.0? = and 2 0.5? = also but repressing the first part of the MFB_measure that ignores the changed rate of the membership function, Discrete1: the approach using discrete method with 1 2 1.5? ?= =  and Discrete2 : the approach using discrete method with 1 2 2.5 TABLE I.

Comparison of Execution Time Fig. 3 shows the execution time of the four approaches The runtimes of them grow linearly as the data stream grows which confirms that they are scalable with respect to the size of data stream, and it is mainly because of the usage of sliding window model. Fuzzy+P uses the least time Fuzzy+MFB has similar execution time to Discrete2, and Discrete1 has the most execution time. The difference of runtimes between them is mainly influenced by the clustering operations they use. The more clustering operations were executed, the more runtime it was Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the number of frequent itemsets and interesting rules found with the data stream increased Fuzzy+P and Fuzzy+MFB used less clustering operations than Discrete1 and Discrete2. Fuzzy+MFB nearly finds the most number of frequent fuzzy sets and interesting rules with the second least of clustering operations. Sometimes Discrete2 returns nearly the same number of fuzzy sets and interesting rules but with more clustering operations and the 


semantics of Discrete2 are meaningless as discussed in experiment one. Furthermore, the number of interesting rules found by Discrete1 is even less than Fuzzy+P that used the clustering operations least which illustrates the superiority of the method using fuzzy sets V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a novel fuzzy ARM algorithm called FFI_Stream is presented to tackle quantitative attributes in data streams and some techniques are proposed in the algorithm. Both synthetic and real datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.  In comparison with the discrete method, the proposed algorithm using fuzzy sets and MFB_measure gets a trade-off between the number of interesting rules and efficiency ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by The National High Technology Research and Development Program of China 863 Program 2008AA042902 Technology Research and Development Program of China 863 Program 2009AA04Z162 Project \(B07031 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Size of Databases\(250 N um be r o f F re qu e n t I

In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
