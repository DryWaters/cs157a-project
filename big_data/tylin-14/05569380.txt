Many methods have been brought out to solve this problem. This paper deals with the problem of association rule mining which preserve the confidentiality of each database. In order to find the association rule, each participant has to share their own data. Thus, much privacy information may be broadcasted or been illegal used. These issues can be divided into three categories: data hiding, knowledge hiding and data mining results publishing. This paper reviews the major method of privacy preserving on each category and choose some of them to complete our system. At the end, an improvement of sensitive rules hiding is proposed to make it more accuracy and security Keywords-privacy preserving; association rule; data hinding knowledge hiding; results publishing I.  INTRODUCTION Association rule mining, as a very important technique has already been applied in a wide range of areas. However it breaks out many privacy issues. From a general point of view, we may classify privacy issues into two broad categories. The first is related to the data hiding, the second concerns the information, or else the knowledge, that a data mining method may discover after having analyzed the data 


and is known as knowledge hiding Data hiding tries to remove confidential or private information from the data before its disclosure. In this case many randomization methods have been addressed. The randomization method has been traditionally used in the context of distorting data by probability distribution. The miner uses the perturbation data to get the association rule. In this case, the data miner does not know the raw data and also can get the similar result. Which the key point for data miner is how to reconstruct the raw data distribution. Agrawal R Gave out a method named Bayes Reconstruction Method [1 Randomization method will change the raw database there will be many negative impacts, just can be classify into two parts y Useful rules have been lost y New rules have been produced artificially In fact, there will be a contradiction between accuracy and security. In other word, if we disturb the raw data so much that the mining result will be poor. In the same, if we disturb it so little that the hacker will get the data they want more easily. To solve this problem, Secure multi-party computation [2] is addressed, it use security communication protocols and cryptography, make it possible to mining rules on the raw data, this can reduce the negative impact. But this will cause huge communication costs. Further more complex cryptography will make the algorithm lowefficiency Knowledge hiding, on the other hand, is concerned with the sanitization of confidential knowledge from the data. As a result of association rule mining, many useful association rules will be discovered, but at the same time, many privacy rules will also be exposed which do not want others to know To solve this, we have to limit the mining process, in order to keep these sensitive rules being hidden. There are so many methods to solve this problem. Which we used is just one kind of them, called Support-based and Confidence-based Blocking Schemes [3, 4, 5 The main disadvantage of a blocking algorithm is the fact that the dataset, apart from the blocked values, is not distorted. Thus, an adversary can disclose the hidden rules by identifying those generating itemsets that contain question marks and lead to rules with a maximum confidence that lies 


above the minimum confidence threshold. If the number of these rules is small then the probability of identifying the sensitive ones among them becomes high. Chris Clifton presents a method to avoid this problem [6 At the end of association rule mining, the frequent itemsets or the association rules with confidence and support factors are published. There is an approach to reconstruct a dataset from the published frequent itemsets, and then use the reconstructed dataset to analyze privacy [13]. This field is called inverse frequent itemset mining [11]. In association rules data mining, it is a convention to conceptually split datasets into two parts: Quasi-identifier \(QI Sensitive Attributes \(SA process, while form as SAQI ? rules published, adversaries may derive the value of SA according to the threshold \(c, s which are confidence and support respectively. If the results This research was supported by Natural Science Foundation from Nanjing University of Information & Science Technology \(20080302 Natural science fund for colleges and universities in Jiangsu Province 08KJD520018 Project 1669 2 published as scSAQI ? , adversaries may inductive the value of SA more precisely, in which sc means exact confidence and support In this study, we use existed approaches to construct the privacy preserving association rule data mining system which can protected privacy from data to knowledge II. APPROACHES In this section, the main approach used in our system is presented. Apriori algorithm is adopted to find the frequent itemsets, and Secure Multiparty Computation \(SMC to get the global support and confidence without privacy disclosure. On the Knowledge hiding, an improved algorithm is mentioned, which can get satisfy result. For mining results hiding, two scenarios are considered A. Secure computation The history of the multi-party computation problem is extensive since it was introduced by Yao [7] and extended by Goldreich et al [8]. The basic idea of SMC is that a computation is secure if at the end of the computation, no 


party knows anything except its own input and the results Security Sum [6, 9] is a very simple and useful method which base on SMC. It is used for get the sum of data from the different site. It works as follow Assume that the value   n l lvv 1 to be computed is known, which lies in the range [0, n]. One site is designated as the master site, numbered 1. The remaining sites are numbered 2 n. Site 1 generates a random number R uniformly chosen from [0, n]. Site 1 adds this to its local value v1, and sends the \(sum R+v1 mod n value R is chosen uniformly from [1, n], the number \(R+v1 mod n site 2 learns nothing about the actual value of v1. For the remaining sites i = 2n, the algorithm is as follows Site i receives   1 1 mod i j j nvRV  then computes    i j ij nVvnvRV 1 mod  and send to site i+1 At last each site do the steps above, and sends the final result back to the site 1, the site 1 minus R and get the sum B. Association rule hiding 


Wang and Jafari [3] proposed two modification schemes that aim at the hiding of predictive association rules, i.e. rules containing the sensitive items on their LHS \(left-hand-side Both algorithms rely on the distortion of a portion of the database transactions to lower the confidence of the association rules. Compared with the work of Saygin et al 4, 5], the algorithms presented in [3] require a reduced number of database scans and exhibit an efficient pruning strategy. However, by construction, they are assigned the task of hiding all the rules containing the sensitive items on their LHS, while the algorithms in the work of Saygin et al can hide any specific rule. In the first strategy, called Increase Support of LHS \(ISL decreased by increasing the support of the itemsets in its LHS. In the second approach, called Decrease Support of RHS \(DSR decreasing the support of the itemsets in its RHS \(right-handside C. Mining results publishing Although association rules only contain aggregate information about original datasets, they have potentials to disclose the private information in the original datasets There are two potential scenarios while association rules publishing. In the first scenario, data owners withhold the exact support and confidence scores. That is, users \(and adversaries together with the thresholds for support \(s c only know the following cQISAP and sQISAP where P means probability As   QIPQISAPQISAP = , so  max QIPcsQISAP ??                                   \(1 In the second scenario, to give users more information about the association rules, data owners also publish the exact support and confidence scores for the association rules That is, when publishing an association rule scSAQI We can derive the following  cQISAP =  and sQISAP =                              \(2 Assuming that adversaries have all the data of the QI attributes, adversaries also know the domain of the sensitive attributes, i.e., they know all the possible values of the 


sensitive attributes. From the equation \(1 2 adversaries may induce the possible value of SA. Obviously the value of SA in equation \(1 than in equation \(2 publish, it is depends on the privacy information disclosure in each form III. OUR ALGORITHMS A. The Association rule mining System Fig.1 gives a general structure of out system, which can be divided into three steps 1670 3 First step: Security Sum is used to get the global support and confidences, which keep the participant dont know the local support of each sit Second step: SMC is adopted to send all itemsets from different site to one center, without data leakage Third step: In this step system does the sensitive rules hidden, its a very important step, building up a Sensitive rules Database, Which contain the rules should be hidden Then something should do to hide these rules, which is discussed in next section  Fig.1.association rule mining system The first two steps are belonging to the data hiding process and the third step is the knowledge hiding process, a detailed description is given in the next section B. Data hiding Center M produces a random data matrix, which meet the average distribution, then sends this matrix to site A. Follow the Security Sum method, we can get the global support and confidence of each item from the local support and confidence on each sit Assume the items on Site A which have a support matrix XA , center M will produce a random matrix Y which have the same order with X, and Y can be distribution-free. Site A get Y and send ZA= X+Y to Site B, Site B with its own support matrix XB, make ZB=ZA+XB. At the end of this process, M will get the global support by minus Y. Each site cant know the local support of the other site The RSA encrypt algorithm is used, Data miner produce the center encrypt key which denoted C-e and the key-pair of 


each site denoted as \(ei,di decryption key. Data miner will send di to Disturb Center and send ei and C-e to each Site. Disturb Center will produce an ID for each site. While, each site will use the ID, ei and Ce to encrypt their own frequent itemset and send the result ID ei\(C-e\(frequent itemset Center use the di and the ID decrypts the data from different site. After this step, Disturb Center will change the data to Ce\(frequent itemset e\(frequent itemset itemsets and use the Apriori algorithm and the global support and confidence form M to analyze the itemsets and get the association rules. The detail of the method is described as follow Encrypt step 1 2 ei,di 3 4 5 Ce\(frequent itemset Decrypt step 1 C-e\(frequent itemset 2 site and remove the ID 3 C-e\(frequent itemset 4 itemsets C. Knowledge hiding In traditional methods, to hide a sensitive rule, some item should be deleted or use an unknown data to change the raw data. In terms of association rule mining, rule A=>B will be discovered, as long as satisfy these two conditions 1. Min_sup B A B A 2 confMin _ support\(A B AB AB AConfidence   


  Properly, decreasing the support of B, decreasing the support of A?B or increasing the support of n can realize hiding the rules. But there is a conflict, when a support of items is changed some other insensitive rule will be hidden at the same time or other new forgery rule will be produced S.-L.Wang [3] proposes two data mining algorithms for hiding informative association rules, namely Increase Support of LHS \(ISL DSR The first algorithm tries to increase the support of left hand side of the rule.  The second algorithm tries to decrease the support of the right hand side of the rule. The detail of the ISL algorithm is described as follow Algorithm ISL  Input 1 2 3 4 Output: a transformed database D, where rules containing X on LHS will be hidden 1. Find large 1-item sets from D 2. For each predicting item x?X 1671 4 3. If x is not a large 1-itemset, then X: = X-{x 4. If X is empty, then EXIT;// no rule contains X in LHS 5. Find large 2-itemsets from D 6. For each x?X 7. For each large 2-itemset containing x 8. Compute confidence of rule U, where U is a rule like x?y 9. If conf\(U 10. Go to next large 2-itemset 11. Else {//Increase Support of LHS 12. Find TL = {t in D|t does not support U 13. Sort TL in ascending order by the number of items 14. While {conf\(U 15. Choose the first transaction t from TL 16. Modify t to support x, the LHS\(U 


17. Compute support and confidence of U 18. Remove and save the first transaction t from TL 19. }; // end While 20. }; // end if conf\(U 21. If TL is empty, then 22. Can not hide x?y 23. Restore D 24. Go to next large-2 itemset 25. } // end if TL is empty 26. } // end of for each large 2-itemset 27. Remove x from X 28. } // end of for each x?X 29. Output updated D, as the transformed D  Through the above method, the sensitive rules will be hidden, but some insensitive rules may have been hidden also, and many new rules may have been produced artificially. To solve this problem, system should use the mining results to restraint the choosing process \(which choose item to modify  Fig 2 sensitive rules hiding process  In the modification the choose process, we choose other item as sacrifice item, in order to get a better results. Then we add some noise rules to increased security In the ISL, the short itemset is chosen as sacrifice item because it has least item, negative impact cause by modify it may be the smallest. Our method first step is the same with ISL or DSR, then check the mining result, in this step, using privacy quantify to measure the result, if its dissatisfied return to change the choose policy. The items with support more close to Min_sup as unsettled itemsets, the other is settled itemsets. While choosing the sacrifice item, the item in settled itemsets will be chosen first As the main disadvantage of a blocking algorithm is the fact that the dataset, apart from the blocked values, is not distorted. So create some noise rules is necessary, to make the dataset distortion, which can be deleted in pruning step D. Result hiding As discussed in section 2.3, there are two forms for publishing the association rules mining results. From the 


viewpoint of privacy preserving, we would like to adopt the form as SAQI ? . But if we are sure that there is less privacy disclosure, we can releases the mining results as form scSAQI ? . Whats form is the best choice? We consider it from the disclose information from the mining results As we know, the adversaries only get the information from equation \(1 2 QIP  is publicity, so the probability of QISAP is induced. Further more, the probability of SAP can be reconstructed from the QISAP , noted as SAP . If the SAP is similar as real probability SAP , we say, the privacy disclosure is serious. The method of reconstruct SAP  from  QISAP is Maximum Entropy Modeling [11]. The similarity between SAP and SAP is measured by standard Kullback-Leibler \(KL  discussed the effect of exact confidence value c, and it gave the data owners a useful guideline to decide whether to publish the exact confidence values [11]. We adopt the idea of Zhus IV. CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have reviewed some approaches about privacy preserving while mining association rules constructed a system for data mining, in which the data knowledge and rules publishing are considered. Using Secure computation and RSA encryption technology, avoid data leakage which cause by data sharing. On the side of knowledge hiding, using ISL and DSR achieve sensitive rules hiding, and an optimization method is presented for better result, with smaller negative impact. For the mining results publishing, the privacy information is measured in 1672 5 two scenarios. The published result form depends on the privacy information disclosure by the published association rules.  What ever data hiding, knowledge hiding or mining results publishing, it is based on small data. How to increase the algorithms efficiency for mass data is future works REFERENCES 1.

This study was aimed to identify another unique characteristic that influence student programming grade using other data analysis method The study indicates that student prior experience in programming before university can contributes to a good grade but it is not guarantee that they can easily score the subject The study also reveals that average grades in Mathematic English, and Malay language during SPM also can influence the final grade. Moreover, male student performance is looked better than female.  In term of personality factor, the investigative and social type plus average cognitive person are found as important factors that influence programming.
