A Scalable Method for Detecting Multiple Loci Associated with Traits using TF-IDF Weighting and Association Rule Mining   SUNWON LEE Dept. of Graduate Program in Bioinformatics Korea University Seoul, Korea sunwonl@korea.ac.kr JAEWOO KANG Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering Korea University Seoul, Korea kangj@korea.ac.kr JUNHO OH Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering Korea University Seoul, Korea junhooh@korea.ac.kr   Abstract  The recent advance in SNP genotyping has made a significant contribution to reduction of the costs for large-scale genotyping. The development also has dramatically increased the size of the SNP genotype data. The increase of the volume of the data, however has posed a huge obstacle to the conventional analysis techniques that are typically vulnerable to the highdimensionality problem To address the issue, we propose a method that exploits two well-tested models: the document-term model and the transaction analysis model. The proposed method consists of two phases. In the first phase, we reduce the dimensions of the SNP genotype data by extracting significant SNPs through transformation of the data in lieu of the document-term model. In the second phase, we discover the 


association rules that signify the relations between the SNPs and the traits, through the application of the transactional analysis in the reduced-dimension genotype data We validated the discovered rules through the literature survey. Experiments were also carried out using the HGDP panel data provided by the Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH, which prove the validity of our new method for identifying appropriate dimensional reduction and associations of multiple SNPs and traits  1. Introduction  In the early days, researchers mainly resorted to statistical approaches \(e.g. logistic regression attempts to figure out the correlation between genetic information and phenotypic traits. Lately, however, the number of SNPs available for genotyping has exponentially increased because the cost of SNP genotyping has dramatically reduced. The increase of the volume of the data has rendered it difficult to apply the traditional statistical techniques per se that are tailored for full space search. As alternatives, some researchers have proposed analysis techniques that are based on algorithmic analysis such as genetic algorithm or subspace clustering [1, 2]. Still, the inherent high-dimensionality problem remains as a challenge In order to address the problem, two well-known models are put to use in this study: the document-term model and the transaction analysis model. Using the two models, a new method is proposed herein to extract, from SNP-trait data, the multiple SNP loci that play a critical role in each of the traits. The proposed method first transforms the SNP genotype data into a document-term model where a trait is represented as a document and the corresponding SNPs are represented as the terms in the document. Once transformed, a variety of text analysis methods can be applied. In this study, we used TF-IDF weighting as a dimensionality reduction tool to filter out non-significant SNPs. We 


then apply a transaction analysis model to the reduceddimension genotype data to discover the association rules that signify the relations between the SNPs and the traits. 1 The contribution of this work is as follows: First we demonstrated that by modeling SNP genotype data in the form of a document-term model, a rich pool of existing tools for text and transaction analysis could be made applicable. Second, we showed that it is possible to tackle SNP-trait association problems through the use of TF-IDF weighting [3] and class association rule mining [4]. Third, also proposed herein is a framework for identifying how multiple SNPs and a trait get associated, a framework that goes beyond the previous works that are limited to the single SNP-trait associations. Lastly, the proposed framework is  Correspondence should be addressed to Jaewoo Kang at kangj@korea.ac.kr 2010 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshops 978-1-4244-8302-0/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE 318 directly applicable to all SNP genotype data regardless of the types of traits and SNPs \(i.e. whether a trait represents a disease or sensitivity to a certain type of medicine achieved through the abstraction with document-term and transaction models The rest of this paper is organized, as follows Chapter 2 introduces previous works related to the topic of this paper; Chapter 3 describes the background information necessary to understand the proposed approach; in Chapter 4 and 5, explored in depth are the proposed method and the experiment results obtained through it; and Chapter 6 concludes this paper  2. Related work  Numerous attempts have been made to study the relations between SNPs and phenotypic traits. As mentioned above, the approaches are put in two categories: statistical approach and algorithmic method The statistical approach has drawn a steady attention 


The multi-dimensionality reduction \(MDR the most outstanding examples of this category [5 The MDR involves four phases. First, a set of n factors are chosen. Here, the chosen factors can be SNP genotype or environmental factors. Second, it constructs a contingency table for case and control for all possible SNP combinations. Third, using the contingency table, it locates SNP combinations that exhibit significant differences between the case and the control. In other words, if the ratio of the case and the control exceeds a predefined threshold, under a certain combination, then this particular combination is marked as high risk, otherwise as low risk. Finally the above-described processes are repeated through the cross-validation process. Through this process, the ndimensional data representing the n factors is reduced to 1-dimensional binary data. While the MDR is good at reducing high-dimensional data, its complexity increases rapidly as the number of factors in the combination increases Zhang and Liu proposed a Bayesian inference method titled Bayesian Epistasis Association Mapping \(BEAM  adopted the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which is used to work out the probability of the SNP epistasis Each SNP belongs to one of the three groups: Group 0 which has nothing to do with diseases, Group 1, which independently operates on diseases, or Group 2, which operate in conjunction with another SNP on diseases The BEAM computes the possibility of each SNPs belonging to one of the three groups, and, thereby finds out the SNP epistasis that affects diseases. Here the odds are worked out, based on the Dirichlet distribution. Although it employs a sophisticated statistical model, in the test with real data, it sometimes fails to identify some of the significant SNP epistasis In addition to the statistical methods, algorithmic methods have also been proposed to find out SNP-trait relations. Chanda et al. proposed a method based on Shannons entropy to find out multiple loci related to diseases [7]. In their paper, the entropy for each SNP locus is computed, and is applied to the forward 


selection algorithm to locate multiple loci related to diseases Researchers have endeavored to come up with algorithms for discovering SNPs related to outbreak of diseases. For example, a decision-tree method was proposed to examine interactions of haplotypes or to interactions of SNPs [8, 9]. Yet another proposal was made, which was to find out, through the ruleinference algorithm, SNP combinations involved in outbreak of diseases [10  3. Preliminaries  In our approach, we reduced dimensions through TF-IDF weighting [3], after modeling the SNP genotype data through the document-term model. Then the class association rule mining [4] was put to use to extract multiple SNP associations. We explain the two concepts briefly here  3.1. TF-IDF  TF-IDF \(Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency text analysis. Under this method, weights are given to terms in accordance with their appearing frequencies in a document that they are in The idea of TF literally refers to the number of appearances that a particular word makes in a document. The more frequently a term shows up, the more important the term is believed to be. For example if a word baseball shows up frequently in a certain document, it is likely to believe that the document is about a sport Despite a high frequency of a term, it is irrational to assign a high weight to the word that is commonly used in the corpus. In a scientific corpus, for instance the word science is not likely to carry a significant meaning. In this context, a higher weight should be given to a word that appears in documents in close connection with a certain topic, while a lower one should be assigned to those words that show up 


without any contextual background. The IDF is used to capture this. In other words, the number of documents is multiplied by its inverse where a certain term appears 319 In short, the IDF helps understand the terms that carry special significance in a certain type of documents  3.2. Class association rule mining  The association rule mining is used to identify the associations of particular item sets from the large transaction data. Under this method, transactions involving diverse item sets are analyzed to find out the sets that are associated with each other. For example the mining technique sorts out, in a giant retail shop which products are purchased jointly with which products The end condition of the algorithm is determined when the number of items reaches up to the one designated by the user, or when the rules are made in such volume as wanted by the user. Frequency of an item is determined by the support of the corresponding item set. The support for Item Set  is computed as frequency of I in transaction set T If this Support is lower than the user-specified parameter, minsup, it is ruled out from the further consideration Once the set of frequent k-item sets is determined, a set of candidates for \(k+1 the same selection process is continued for this candidate sets. When the end condition is ultimately satisfied, association rules are created from the discovered sets of frequent items Confidence serves as the criterion for extracting this rule. If the obtained confidence for the corresponding rule fails to be greater than the user-defined parameter minconf, the rule is aborted from the extraction process The class association rule mining is a special case of the association rule mining, where the value of the right side of the final rule is a class, for example, such 


as traits in our context  4. Method  We propose a new analytical framework to identify the relations between multiple SNPs and traits. The proposed method consists of two phases. In Phase 1 dimensions of SNP genotype data are reduced by means of the TF-IDF weighting method. Once reduced multiple SNP-trait associations are located from the data in the second phase through class association rule mining  4.1. Dataset  We used the HGDP panel data in the study, which are provided by the Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH The data contain a pool of SNP genotypes of 1,043 individuals selected from 57 population groups. SNPs of an individual amount to more than 660,000 in number. To eliminate the impact of the gender factor SNPs on sex chromosomes were eliminated1 The 57 population groups were broadly divided into Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East, America and Oceania  4.2. Phase 1: Dimensionality Reduction  The SNP genotype data are of high dimension in nature, which makes it particularly challenging to apply conventional analysis methods. In order to alleviate the problem, we first reduce the dimension of the data using TF-IDF weighting, after transforming the data according to the document-term model, as explained above. Under the model, each population group is deemed a document, and each SNP genotype as the term constituting the document. Then, the TFIDF weight of each SNP genotype is calculated as follows  b b   \b         \(6 


 where TFij is the normalized term frequency of SNP j in population i, and IDFj is the log-ratio of the total number of populations and the number of populations that have SNP j In accordance with the calculated TF-IDF weights top-k high-scoring SNPs are selected from each population. Only the SNPs appearing at least once in the top-k lists are used for class association rule mining in Phase 2  4.3. Phase 2: Rule Mining  In the second phase, we analyze the reduceddimension SNP genotype data through the transaction analysis model. If a SNP genotype retained by an individual is considered as an item, it is possible to deem each individual a single transaction. Within this context, SNP genotype data are transformed into a set of transactions. Further, each transaction is labeled with a trait, which is in our context, a population group Once transformed, the conventional class association rule mining becomes applicable. The class association rule is expressed, as follows  f 7  where representing a set of SNP genotypes and Populationj represents  1 http://www.cephb.fr/en/hgdp 320 the jth population. This rule implies that the SNPSet is likely to be associated with the jth population In conventional class association rule mining, the support is defined over all classes. In our context however, it may penalize the small-sized populations as they are likely to be ruled out because of the inevitable low frequency co-occurrence of the SNP sets and the population. In order to address this problem 


we introduce a normalized support that is a support normalized by the size of population. On the other hand, for confidence, the conventional definition can be used as is. The rule confidence and population support are given as follows    01"+23456278+,-./+.018      \(8 9 01"+234561278+,-3234561278     \(9  Rule confidence represents how strong the association between a SNP set and a population would be. In other words, a rule is given a high confidence when the SNP set appears frequently in the population group, and not in the other population groups. On the other hand, Population support refers to the frequency of a SNP set existing in a population group. By appropriately setting these two parameters, we are able to obtain rules that highlight population specific SNP associations  5. Results & Discussion  To attest to the validity of the proposed method, we conducted three tests. First, we conducted a clustering analysis using the reduced-dimension SNP genotype data in order to see the efficacy of the TF-IDF weighting as a dimensionality reduction tool. Second we carried out rule mining to discover rules associating SNP sets to populations. To prove the validity of the rules obtained from the experiment, we performed literature survey. Unfortunately, no studies have been conducted on the SNPs that we extracted in the rules let alone the relations between them and the population Finally, we iterated the same test, this time to discover rules associating SNP sets to the geographical regions instead of populations. The validity of some of the rules obtained in this experiment was proven through previous studies on the SNPs that are related to the Asian population [12 For the dimensionality reduction test, each of the 57 


population groups in the dataset was considered as a single document, and a SNP IDgenotype pair with minor allele was considered as a term. After weighting the terms using TF-IDF, we extracted top-100 terms from each population group. Using these terms, the Jaccard similarity between each population group was computed Figure 1 represents the dendrogram of the populations that was constructed using the Jaccard similarity as the similarity metric. The result shown in Figure 1 suggests that the TF-IDF-based weighting could be a viable alternative for the dimensionality reduction for the SNP genotype data. The reason is that population groups sharing the same branch are those who live close to each other or those who live in the same country. It is reasonable to assume that ethnic groups living in similar geographical regions and sharing similar cultures must come from the same origin It was difficult, however, to interpret the results concerning the Bantu group, since most of the populations in Bantu group had only one or two samples in the dataset. Still, it seems plausible to Figure 1.  A dendrogram constructed with top100 SNP genotype data using Jaccard similarity 321 analogically infer that the emerging pattern of SNPs minor allele of each individual using the Bantu language is similar to each other. One intriguing matter is that the Chinese minority group of Uygur population shares branches with other Muslim population groups In other words, Uygur population shows a high similarity with Muslim group. Indeed, they turned out the decedents of Osman Turks2  Rules Population [F-score rs98278[mm] Bantu_N.E.

Rules extracted from the second experiment where the associations between SNP genotypes and populations are identified. The M and m refer to major and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively  Previous studies on genetic structures of ethnic groups reached a similar conclusion. Rosenberg et al conducted clustering analysis using SNP data clustering 52 peoples into 6 clusters [11]. Each cluster belongs to one of the following: Africa Europe+Middle East+Central/South Asia, East Asia Oceania, America and Kalash population. Under this scheme, Europe, Middle East and Asia populations constitute one cluster. A similar result was observed also in our study. For example, in the left part of the 


dendrogram, Asian and European populations are shown to share the same branch. In the middle part American populations share a branch. And in the right  2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_people part, Africa populations share one branch and Central/South Asia populations share another Next, the class association rule mining was tested The resulting frequent SNP groups of subject populations further revealed the frequent SNP sets unique to some population groups. Some of the results are shown in Table 1. Table 1 depicts top scoring rules up to three returned less than three rules that exceed our quality constraints. We used 0.3 for both Rule Confidence and Population Support. In the end, 3,779 rules were drawn out. Under each rule, M indicates the major allele of the relevant SNP locus, while m refers to the minor allele of the locus. Most of the rules are 3-SNP rules with the 5-SNP rule being the longest. Each rules weight is computed through the following ;  9  9 A?BCDCEFG=@@EAHAIHCE<=>?@A?BCDCEFJG=@@EAHAIHCE    \(11  A SNP constituting a rule with high scores usually shows a high frequency of its minor allele in the corresponding population. For instance, with regard to genotypes rs1553533 and rs1553554, one of the two genotypes is found overwhelmingly more often than the other in Surui population. Other than this information, however, no studies have been conducted on the relations between populations and the SNPs extracted in the rules In order to work around this problem, we examined the association between SNPs and traits in a coarser level. In this experiment, we examined the association between the SNPs and the geographical regions. In our dataset, multiple populations are mapped to a geographical region. The results are shown in Table 2 We also used 0.3 for both Rule Confidence and Population Support for this experiment. The rules 


found in this experiment retain F-scores lower than those in Table 1 This outcome seems to stem from the increased heterogeneity of the individuals in the same class \(i.e., geographical region KLMNOPQRSTTU  V9 suggests that rs256871 SNP has some relation with Asian populations. Our literature survey discovered an association between them such that rs256871 SNP is part of SEPT8 gene, and, in turn the SEPT8 gene is known to be accountable for tuberculosis among Asians [12 Nonetheless, most of the rules found in this study were difficult to interpret, because, out of more than 660,000 SNPs used in the study, very small numbers of such SNPs had been subject to research for  3 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218008T 4 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218014Q 322 determining the relations with particular traits such as population and geographical region.

Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
