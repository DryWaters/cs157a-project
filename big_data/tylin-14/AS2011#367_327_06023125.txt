Larger the distance of two vectors is, smaller the cosine value is; on the contrary the similarity is lower 3 Initial Optimization Center based on "Min-Max" Principle Here K-Means clustering algorithm based on the min-max" principle was adopted to choose initial centers The "min-max" principle can ensure the distance between the initial centers far enough. Firstly choose two domain concepts with the minimum similarity from the similarity matrix as the initial centers. Secondly for each non-center domain concept, obtain the ones which have the maximum similarity with the existed centers. Finally choose the domain concepts with the minimum similarity from those maximum similarities as new centers. Suppose the number of chosen centers is m, then recurrence formula of the m+1 2,1],,,2,1 max{min[ mjmixxd ij LL ?=      \(3 According to the rule that the distance between adjacent centers should grow stable, then determine mutation point k. The number of centers should be less than the square of the number of clustering data, that means nk < . The concept center depth is calculated as the following  min min min min idistidistidistidistiDepth ?++??=   \(4 The center domain concepts prior to the max Depth\(i chosen as center, and the following ones become non- center 


K-Means clustering algorithm is as the follows Step1: Divide the non- center domain concepts into the clusters of nearest center Step2: Choose new centers from the clusters where similarity of domain concepts must exceed the appointed value Repeat step1, 2 until the obtained centers or cluster set become stable C. Extraction of Non-taxonomy Relations Compared to the extraction of taxonomy relations, the extraction of non-taxonomy is more difficult. Extracting the related concept pairs is the key. The method based on association rules mining is adopted to extract related concept pairs. The algorithm of extracting related concept pairs is as follows Output: the set of related concept pairs 117  Step1: Construct a concept pair set by gathering every two different concepts Step2: For each concept pair in the set, calculate the support and the confidence based on association rules mining algorithm If both support and confidence satisfy MinSup and MinConf, the concept pair is related; else the pair must be deleted V. IMPLEMETATION OF A SEMI-AUTOMATIC DOMAIN ONTOLOGY CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM This section mainly shows the operation of each module in this system A. Implemetation of Domain Concepts Extraction Module Users can check the selected concept words and then delete the illegal ones in this interface. The output is compound and common words. The interface of concept extraction module is shown in Figure.3  Figure 3.  The interface of concept extraction module B. Implemetation of Taxonomy Relations Extraction Module An example is shown in Figure. 4. The left edit box is the set of edited domain concepts, which are the data source of the taxonomy and non-taxonomy relations extraction module 


The three boxes in the middle, respectively implement extraction of taxonomy relation based on clustering and generalized suffix tree and extraction of non-taxonomy relations based on association rules mining. The right edit box shows the extraction results  Figure 4.  Example of extraction of relations among domain concepts VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Nowadays it is also quite difficult to construct a common and mature tool used for constructing ontology semi-automatically. The methods in this paper adopted accelerate the construction of ontology to some extent, but there are still many defects. \(1 manual .This reduces the automatic degree and efficiency 2 characteristics of language. \(3 different grammatical components of sentence to conclude the relations among concepts can be tried REFERENCES 1] Gruber T R.

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
