Reducing the database on 
C  or incorporating it into an algorithm for mining frequent itemsets such as Charm-L, Eclat\ and resolving the problem are very time consuming, especially when C is often changed. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for mining them as follows. Firstly, it is necessary to mine only one time from database the class L G A containing the closed itemsets together their generators. After that, when C is changed, the class of all frequent closed itemsets and their generators on C is determined quickly from L G A  
by our algorithm MINE_CG_CONS We obtain the algorithm MINE_FS_CONS to mine and classify efficiently all frequent itemsets with constraint from that class. Theoretical results and the experiments proved the efficiency of our approach Closed itemsets, frequent itemsets, constraint, generators eliminable itemsets I   I NTRODUCTION  Currently, Internet makes the real changes in the ways human thinks and does. People access to Internet to get useful information from it. Normally, the data of websites for users is obtained and is saved in the tables \(or databases The number of attributes \(items\ is often enormous However, for a while, they only take care of a set of attributes \(called the constraint\. To show immediately to the 
users the knowledge mined from them such as the frequent itemsets or association rules is very important. In [3, 5, 8, 9 13, 14  s o m e a u t h o r s r e s e a r c h e d o n m i ni ng f r e que nt  i t e m s e t s  and association rules from the standpoint of the userês interaction with the system They studied mining frequent itemsets with many different kinds of constraints Nguyen et al.

Some categories of constraints such as anti- monotone, monotone, and succinct have been integrated into the mining process In   1 3   P e i  et al. proposed the concept of convertible constraints and considered pushing them into the mining progress of the FPgrowth algorithm.

In [5 C o n g a n d  L i u pr op os e d  a n  technique based on the concept of tree boundary to utilize previous mining results for reducing the mining time. They considered tightening and relaxing constraints such as increasing and decreasing supports This paper concentrates on solving the problem of to find frequent itemsets contained in a subset C of the set of all items from a given database \(called the problem of mining frequent itemsets with constraint C  A simple approach is to 
reduce the database on C and after that to mine them by an algorithm used widely such as Apriori   Eclat 2   Charm-L 18   F P gr ow t h  8   e t c  T h i s a p pr o a c h  i s n o t  efficient because the constraints are often changed. A different one is to filter the output of those algorithms in a post-processing step to determine frequent itemsets with constraint. It is also not efficient because their outputs are usually enormous. In [14 S r i k an t e t  al s h o w ed th at w e  should incorporate C into the mining process. They modified the apriori candidate generation procedure to only count candidates that contain selected items. However, there are still many candidates generated. Furthermore, when 
C is changed, users must run the algorithm. It is very time consuming. In [8 H a n e t  a l   a l s o s u gg e s t e d i n c o r p o r a t i n g  C  into the mining FP-Tree. However, they did not propose the algorithm to do it. We also incorporate constraint C into Charm-L and Eclat \(well-known algorithms for mining frequent closed itemsets and all frequent itemsets\ to mine frequent itemsets with constraint. This approach will be compared to our approach Recently, we [15, 16 s h o w ed th e s t r u c t u r e o f ea c h cla s s  of equivalent frequent itemsets having the same closure based on the generators and eliminable subsets of that closure. Based on it, we approach to the problem of mining frequent itemsets with constraint as follows. Firstly, it is 
necessary to mine only one time from the database the class LG A containing the closed itemsets and their generators After that, when C is changed, the class FLG C of frequent closed itemsets and their generators is determined quickly from LG A Using a unique representation of frequent itemset we derive completely, directly, non-repeatedly from FLG C  all frequent itemsets with constraint  The mining script is shown as follows 1  To mine only one time the class LG A

2  User selects the constraint C and the minimum support threshold s 2.1  to determine quickly the class s A FLG of the frequent closed itemsets \(and their generators\ith respect to s from LG A in the first mining time; otherwise, from max s A FLG was saved before\, where s max is maximum such that s max 002 s 2.2  from s A FLG our algorithm MINE_CG_CONS based on the propositions 2 and 3\ is used to exploit directly the class FLG C  2.3  from FLG C the class FS C of all frequent itemsets with constraint C is mined quickly by our algorithm MINE_FS_CONS \(using theorem 4 3  Return the step 2        Figure 1  Mining frequent itemsets with constraint The method is suitable when C is usually changed Indeed, the size of the class of all frequent closed itemsets and their generators is much smaller than the one of all frequent itemsets, especially on the dense databases. With the small values of minimum support thresold, this class can be still mined and saved in main memory by Charm-L and MinimalGenerators [18  Th e  r e s p o n s e o f th e s y s t em  in ear l y  times is often slow because the size of LG A is big. After the first period, the classes of 1 s A FLG  2 s A FLG  n s A FLG are saved in the system \(the values of s j j=1, .., n are distributed regularly on [0 0 \002 s 1 s 2 s n 002 1\. Thus, we only need to select the frequent closed itemsets and generators that those supports exceed threshold s directly on max s A FLG  where s max max {s j s j 002 s, j=1, .., n}. For the threshold s given by user, the corresponding threshold s max is usually closed to it. Therefore, the time to exploit s A FLG is often small. Using  some simple operators on the itemsets in s A FLG  we can mine directly the class FLG C  of the frequent closed itemsets and generators restricted on C  The class FS C is partitioned into the disjoint equivalence classes Each class contains frequent itemsets on C that have the same closure. So, they can be mined concurrently by parallel algorithms. A unique representation of frequent itemsets based on frequent closed itemset \(represented to that class and its generators is indicated to derive directly, nonrepeatedly all frequent itemsets on C from FLG C  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls some primitive concepts and results. This section also proposes a unique representation of itemsets. The main results are in section 3. In it, we obtain the algorithm for determining quickly all frequent closed itemsets and their generators with constraint C The efficient algorithm to mine all frequent itemsets from them is also figured out. Sections 4 and 5 contain the experimental results and conclusions II  P RIMITIVE CONCEPTS AND RESULTS  A  Primitive concepts Given set O contained records or transactions of a database T and A contained attributes or items related to each of transaction o 002 O and R is a binary relation in O x A  Consider two operators: \003:2 O 0042 A 005:2 A 0042 O determined as  003  004  O  002  003  A  003\(O\ = {a 004 A o, a 004  R  005 o 004 O 005 O 006 O  004\(A\ = {o 004 O o, a 004  R  005 a 004 A 005 A 006 A  Defining closure operator h in 2 A 4 y   h = \003 o  004 we  say that  h\(A\is the closure of itemset A 005 A If A = h\(A\, A is called closed itemset The class of all closed itemsets is denoted as CS The support of itemset A is defined as the probability of the ocurrence of a transaction containing A on O  s\(A 007 A O  Denoted that s 0 is minimum support, s 0  002 1 O 1  i f s A  006 s 0 then A is called frequent itemset   Let FS  FCS be the classes of all frequent itemsets and all frequent closed itemsets For two non-empty itemsets G, A 004\006 G 005 A 005 A G is called a generator of A [11 ff  h\(G\h\(A and  005  003\010 G 011 G 012 h\(G 011 h\(G Let G A\e the class of all generators of A Let LG A and FLG A  1 be the classes of all closed itemsets together their generators on A and all elements in LG A that are frequent with respect to s 0 In 2 A an itemset R is called eliminable in S [15, 16 i f f  R 007 S and 003 S 003 S\\R\ Let N S denote the class of all eliminable itemsets in S N S N S 004 we have [1   N S\ {A: A 006 S\\G, G 004  G S TABLE I  DATABASE 1 Trans ID Items 1  aceg 2 acfh 3 adfh 4 bceg  Example 1 Let us consider database 1 in Table I, with minimum support s 0 used in all next examples of this paper. From the definitions of \003 and \005, we have: \003\({1, 4 ceg, \005\(ceg\ = {1, 4} and then, h\(ceg\=ceg. So ceg is a frequent closed itemset with the support 003 ceg O    1 For briefly, we write s A FLG simply A FLG  C s  T LG A  FLG A  FLG C  FS C

This itemset contains two generators e, g because h\(e\h\(g\=h\(ceg\=ceg B  Structure of Itemsets In this part, the class of all itemsets is partitioned into the disjoint equivalence classes. The elements of an equivalence class have the same closure and can be derived from that closure and its generators. Thus, we only need to mine the class \(with the small size\ of frequent closed itemsets \(and generators\. When it is necessary, we can derive to users the frequent itemsets in a class that they are interested in Definition 1 1  Equivalence relation h over the class of all itemsets 2 A   010 A, B 002  2 A  A h B 013 h\(A\ = h\(B Theorem 1 15 A partition of 2 A  Relation   h  partitions 2 A  into the disjoint equivalence classes. Each class contains itemsets that have the same closure. The equivalence class containing A is denoted as [A   2 A  A A 004 011 CS and FS  AFCS A 004 011  Based on this partition, we can exploit independently each equivalence class. The elements in a class have the same support so we only compute and save it once Theorem 2 1  Representation of itemset For every itemset A such that 004\006 A 002 CS  X 004 A  013  014 G 0 004 G A 014 X 004 N A\X = G 0 X 2  Denoted N S, G\ := {A: A 006 S\\G, G 004 G S it is obvious that N S   SG G\(S 004 002 N G For G 1 G 2  002  G S\, G 1 006 G 2 the intersection of N S, G 1 nd N S, G 2 can be not empty. The above representation of a itemset in a class can be not unique because the representation of an eliminable itemset is not unique Example 2 Let us consider equivalence class [X  w h e r e X=aceg G X\ = {ae, ag  We have  N X, ae\ {cg, c, g N X, ag\={ce, c, e N X, ae 012 N X, ag\ = {c 006  004 and N X N X, ae 013 N X, ag\= {cg, c, g, e, ce}. Then from theorem 2, [X   a e, a e g  a ec, a ecg a g a g c  in  which, aeg can be represented by two ways: aeg = ae+g ag+e C  Unique Representation of Itemset by Generator and Eliminable Itemset The process of deriving of all itemsets of an equivalence class using theorem 2 can make the duplication because the representation of an itemset is not unique.  Theorem 3 shows a unique representation of itemset, in other words, based on it  all itemsets in the same class can be derived nonrepeatedly \(as a result, quickly\, completely   2 The symbol + is denoted as the union of two disjoint sets 010 X 002 CS let us call i U i X\(X XX 002  002 G X U,i X U X i  X_=X\\X U IS X\= {Xê=X i X i X  X i 002 G X\, X  005 X_ X i 005 X U,i i=1 or \(i>1: X k 014 X i X i  010 k: 1 015 k<i Theorem 3 \(Unique representation of itemset by generator and eliminable itemset We have a  X  IS X b  All itemsets of IS X\re derived non-repeatedly Proof  a  006  If X 002 X a s s u m e t h a t i  i s t h e  m i ni m u m  i n de x such that X i 002 G X\ X i 005 X\\X i and Xê = X i X i Let X i  X i 012 X U X  X i X U then X i 005 X U,i X  Xê\\X U 005 X_ and Xê = X i X i X  Assume that there exists the index k such that 1 015 k<i, X k 002 G X\ X k 007 X i X i then Xê=X k X k  where X k X k X  and X k X i X i X k 005 X\\X k X  005 X\\X k  Thus, X k 005 X\\X k it is absurd  015  If X 002 IS X\, there exists X i 002 G X\ X  005 X_ 005 X\\X i  X i 005 X U,i 005 X\\X i Xê=X i X i X  Let Xêê= X i X  002 N X then Xê=X i Xêê, thus X 002 X t h e o r e m 2   b\ Assume that there exists i, k such that i>k 016 1 and X i X i X  i  017 X k X k X  k where: X i X k 002 G X\ X  i  X  k 005 X_; X i 005 X U,i X k 005 X U,k Since X k 012 X  i  004 so X k 007 X i X i the equality do not occur because X i and X k are two different generators of X\. It contradicts to the selection of index i 007 Example 3 Let us consider class [X w h e r e X  a ceg  G X X 1 ae, X 2 ag}, we have: X U aeg, X U,1 g, X U,2 e, X_=c By theorem 3, itemset Xê=aceg 002 IS X\s generated uniquely as follows: Xê=X 1 X 1 X  where X 1 g 005 X U,1  X  c 005 X_. By theorem 2, Xê has two duplicate representations: Xê=ae+cg=ag+ce. If the condition çi>1 X k 014 X i X i  010 k: 1 015 k<ié is absent, then duplicate Xê is generated once again: Xê=X 2 X 2 X  where X 2 e 005 X U,2  and X 1 007 X 2 X 2 Similarly, all itemsets of [X   IS X ae, aeg, aegc, aec, ag, agc} are derived non-repeatedly From theorem 3, the algorithm GEN_ITEMSETS is obtained \(see Fig. 2\to generate non-repeatedly all itemsets in each equivalence class X  X 004 CS  III  M INING FREQUENT ITEMSETS WITH CONSTRAINT  As the discussion in introduction, to mine frequent itemsets on C with minimum support threshold s 0 firstly without the general, we need to determine the class FLG A  of all frequent \(with respect to s 0 closed itemsets and their generators from LG A After that, it is quickly to mine the class FLG C  of all frequent closed itemsets and generators restricted on C from FLG A That bases on some relations between closed itemsets and generators of FLG C and the  corresponding ones of FLG A Finally, the partition of the

Thus we will sort all items by th e order of their supports. To determine a constraint C with the size l i firstly, we construct the first subset C 1 of C containing [p*l i  t e m s  randomly selected from the set of high-support items in A F  where p 002 0  t h e r e m a i n e d p a r t  C 2 of C contains  [\(1p i   r a n d o m ly s e lec t e d ite ms f r o m  A F  C 1 For experiments at here, we set p = 0.5 and consider two constraints for each l i  We will do two comparisons. Firstly, in Table VI, we compare the average time for mining frequent closed itemsets and their generators with constraint C by our algorithm MINE_CG_CONS  shown in column T C O   to  the one by C CharmGen column T C C upon P, M, Co, and Ch C CharmGen is the combination of C Charm \(for mining frequent closed itemsets with constraint\ and MinimalGenerators [19  f o r d e t e r m i n i ng t he i r g e ne ra t o rs    The reduction in the mining time is shown in column RT C O  RT C O T C C T C O With the different minimum support thresholds, we see that it is drastic, ranging from a factor of 60 to 316 times! That reduction plays an important role in mining quickly association rule with constraints because, as the discussion on [15, 6 a l l  a sso c i a t i o n  r u l e s c a n b e m i n e d  quickly from frequent closed itemsets and their generators TABLE VI  M INING FREQUENT CLOSED ITEMSETS AND GENERATORS WITH CONSTRAINT   M INE _ CG _ CONS VS CCHARMGEN   DB MS T C C T C O RT C O  Co 75 1.07 0.005 213  65 1.29 0.013 99  55 3.49 0.026 134 Ch 65 1.21 0.011 115  55 6.08 0.055 111  50 10.93 0.111 98 P 80 1.50 0.010 145  70 13.74 0.115 120  65 39.22 0.243 161 M 15 0.16 0.003 60  5 0.84 0.003 316  1 4.80 0.018 264  In the second, the time for mining all frequent closed itemsets restricted on C by our algorithm MINE_FS_CONS  is compared to the one by C Eclat We did experiments on on three databases \(that have many items\o, P, M. The reduction in the mining time by our approach is drastic. It ranges from a factor of 14 to 1063 times and is shown in Fig 5               Figure 5  The reduction in mining time all frequent itemsets with constraint MINE_FS_CONS vs C Eclat  For database P, the reductions are small because the average size of transactions is small compared with the number of all items. Then, practically \(users are usually interested in high-support items\, we should consider the constraints containing many high-support items. Indeed, the bigger of the number of high-support items \(corresponding with the big values of p\ are, the bigger reductions become Table VII showed that. In addition, the output of our algorithm MINE_FS_CONS is classified into disjoint classes. All frequent itemsets with constraint in a class have

and wheezes. That rule consist of eight attributes; gender occupation, diabetes type, cholesterol level, sodium level diastolic blood pressure, edema and wheezes. Using those attributes, a decision tree was generated which is shown in figure 3 Wheezes was selected as the decision attribute for this tree. As shown in figure 3, the association rule can be easily proven by the use of this decision tree. In the tree the highest numbers of records are shown under the attributes values which were given by the association rule. That node contains 1218 records from the whole data set and that is the highest number of values in the whole decision tree By this decision tree the association rule can be proved Figure 1. Decision tree for diabetes type 2 and edema 374 and that increases the validity of the rule which shows that people who have diabetes type 2, who are female housewives, having normal range of sodium level and diastolic blood pressure and who has edema and has low cholesterol level are having a higher probability of getting Wheezes Gender=F occupation=Housewife Sodium Level=135145 diastolic=60-80 cholesterol <5.17 edema = Yes diabetesType=Type 1 ==> wheezes=Yes conf :\( 0.95 Second association rule selected for diabetes type 1 discovered a relationship between diabetes type 1 and wheezes and that rule was almost similar to the rule generated for diabetes type 2 The decision tree in figure 4 was generated by using the attributes in the association rule and from that the rule can be proved. Here wheezes was selected as the decision attribute for this tree. The edema has the highest number of records than all the other nodes So, another important thing that can be identified by this tree is; the people who have diabetes and edema have the highest probability for originating wheezes than people who havent edema. Edema has a contribution towards wheezes than other attributes.  So, it can be concluded that there is a higher relationship between edema and wheezes 3 and FBS level After generating decision trees with different attribute 


combinations, one was selected as the optimal decision tree which contains the best attribute combination. When analyzing this decision tree there was a branch which has the attribute combination as BMI= 18.5-24.9, Occupation=Housewife, Gender Female, Systolic blood pressure= 90- 120, Diastolic blood pressure= 60-80 There were 600 records in the selected dataset which belong to the patients who are housewives having BMI range of 18.5-24.9, systolic blood pressure between 90- 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 60-80 mmHg. Out of those patients there were 494 patients whose FBS level was above 125 mg/dl. It was out of the 1947 patients who have more than 125 mg/dl FBS level This attribute combination was selected as the best combination among all the combinations in this tree because it was the attribute combination which the highest number of patients had and among them about 83% had more than 125 mg/dl FBS level Because of these reasons it can be proved that the people who are the housewives having BMI range of 18.5-24.9 systolic blood pressure between 90- 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 60-80 mmHg have  highest risk of having more than 125 FBS level. But these BMI range Systolic BP range and Diastolic BP range are the normal levels which should be there in the human body When analyzing much more about this the best rule generated by the decision tree, with the patients dataset, it was identified that 93.82% of those patients were in the range of 39  75 years. Therefore the age which has most possibility of having more than 125 FBS level can be proved as more than 39 years Also in the dataset 85.90% of the patients with this attribute combination had wheezes. Patients with above attributes and age range of 39-75 years, 76.72% had wheezes. As mentioned in earlier sections, as well as results generated by the association rules also prove this situation that there is a link between wheezes and increased FBS level Also among the patients with above attribute collection there were 95.87% patients with primary or secondary education level. Therefore it can be said that, when the education level is low of a person it affects his FBS level in 


blood. The reason for that can be not having enough knowledge about the necessary life style needed to control the sugar level The best finding is that there patients with attribute combination generated by decision tree were 100% females The decision tree generated to further analyze the relationship between gender and FBS level is shown in figure 5 When considering the decision trees generated to analyze the probability of gender in different attribute combinations, in most of the times WEKA did not even generated the tree. The reason is that, when designing the tree, WEKA selects the best attributes to split the data records at the top of the decision tree to get the possibilities Figure 2. Decision tree for diabetes type 1 and edema Figure 3. Decision tree for diabetes type 1 and wheezes 375 of the particular attribute. When considering attribute Gender, female has the highest possibility than male Therefore there is no reason to do the splitting any more Association rules that generated regarding the gender and both diabetes types also proved that when the other attributes are in normal levels gender becomes the major attribute of increasing the possibility of having Diabetes The overall conclusion which can be obtained through this is, the patients who are female housewives having wheezes, BMI range of 18.5-24.9, systolic blood pressure between 90- 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 60-80 mmHg has the most possibility of more than 125 mg/dl in the FBS level. Because the BMI range, Systolic BP range and Diastolic BP range are in the normal levels; the gender of female, aged between 39-75 years, education level only having primary or secondary education and having wheezes become the major decision factors of high FBS level V. DISCUSSION Following section is about the problems encountered and issues faced when doing the project and key contributions of the research towards the diabetes field and research community A. Problems Faced When considering the phase 2 of the research there were 


several problems with the WEKA software, when generating the decision tree. The content of the window which displays the generated decision tree cannot be zoomed out/in according to the requirement of the user. Therefore it was difficult to view and analyze the generated decision trees with all its' branches according to the needs. Also the generated decision tree could not copy to another application. Therefore generating an image of a large decision trees were impossible B. Key contributions of the research One of the key contributions of this research is to identify hidden risk factors of Diabetes. The other key contribution is to identify whether there is any possibility to increase the Diabetes risk level when different combinations of risk factors are taken together The value of these key contributions can be described focusing different end users such as physicians and the people who have or who do not have Diabetes. For example after experimentally proving the results of this research, the doctors will be able to exactly say how much of possibility a person has to get Diabetes and other diseases which occur as side effects of Diabetes. Other than that the patient will be able to get a brief idea of whether he would get Diabetes in the future or whether he already has Diabetes in his body without his knowledge VI. CONCLUSION This paper discussed the utilization of classification techniques and association rules generation to identify the undiscovered decision factors of diabetes and the effects of diabetes Phase 1 of this research included the preliminary findings of the generation and analysis of the association rules. After the association rules generation, to further improve the reliability of the results, classification approach was used This paper covered the phase 2 of the research which covers the application of classification techniques. The conclusions which can be made through phase 1 and phase 2 are stated below A relationship between edema and diabetes has been identified from the association rules generation. The results obtained from the decision tree analysis also clearly state that, the probability of occurring edema for both diabetic 


type patients will increase if they have wheezes. From the decision trees generated for edema and both diabetes types it can be concluded that, wheezes will more affect towards developing edema for both diabetic types than the other attributes A strong relationship between wheezes and diabetes also identified with association rules. Currently in the medical field, no relationship is identified between wheezes and diabetes. The decision tree analysis regarding this aspect discovered that the diabetic patients who are suffering from edema have the highest probability for developing wheezes than the people who havent edema. Edema has a contribution towards wheezes than other attributes.  So, it can be concluded that there is a higher relationship between edema and wheezes In the previous phase of this research, a high risk for women towards diabetes was identified than men. Another conclusion obtained was, when the BMI range, systolic BP Blood Pressure normal levels, females with only primary or secondary Figure 5.    Decision tree for diabetes type 2 and gender.Figure 4. Decision tree for diabetes type 2 and wheezes 376 education aged between 39-75 years, and having wheezes will have a high risk towards developing high FBS levels All the above discovered relationships are true for both Diabetes type 1 and type 2. But Diabetes type 1 has a stronger relationship with all those factors than type 2 Currently in the medical field, none of the above discovered information was proved except the relationship between diabetes and edema. Since a strong relationship between diabetes and edema was identified through the data mining techniques, other rules also have a higher possibility of proven by the real world experiments All the conclusions of the entire research were generated through data mining process and evaluated through the related literature and the domain experts knowledge. But they must be   validated through real life applications and medical experiments. That is the major future work to be done for this research ACKNOWLEDGMENT Our sincere gratitude goes to Dr. H. A.
