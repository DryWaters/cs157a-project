This paper proposes a new hybrid recommendation methodology, called INORM based on recommendation methods and costumer navigational and behavioral algorithms to enhance the recommendation quality and the system performance of current recommender systems Keywords-recommendation methods, customers behavior, recommendation quality,collaborating filtering I. INTRODUCTION Recommender systems are used by E-commerce sites to suggest products to their customers and to provide consumers with information to help them determine which products to purchase The forms of recommendation include suggesting products to the consumer, providing personalized product information, summarizing community opinion, and providing community critiques. The purpose of personalized information services is to adjust strategies of promotion and advertisement to fit customer interests. New enterprises can deal with a particular customers Web experiences by providing customer personalization service and communicating or interacting with customers. Such understandings of customers can be transformed customer information into quality services or products [1]. [2 In this paper we try to introduce some recommender methods such as Collaborative Filtering WRFM, Web CF-AR and some hybrid approaches 


and present their advantages and problems.    After introducing the product recommendation methods, this paper introduces a new method known as "INORM that applies the advantages of various present methods. The INORM method has empirically been analyzed and compared with some current methods This method, showing a minimal qualitative improvement of 56.25% considering the present methods of product suggestion, has radically revolutionized the ecommerce product suggestions of today using costumer navigational and behavioral algorithms. This method also gives different optimal recommendations to the costumers with minimizing the sellers intervene II. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS Recommender systems are technologies that assist businesses to implement one-to-one marketing strategies. Recommender systems have emerged in ecommerce applications to support product recommendation [3], which provide individual marketing decisions for each customer [4 Recommender systems rely on customer purchase history to determine customer preferences and to identify products that customers may purchase Supporting product recommendation services can strengthen the relationship between the buyer and seller and thus increase profit. [3] [5] Recommender systems enhance E-commerce sales in some ways helping customers find products they wish to purchase; converting browsers into buyers; improving cross-sell by suggesting additional products for the customer to purchase; improving loyalty by creating a value- added relationship between the site and the customer [6 A. collaborative filtering method Although a variety of recommendation techniques has been developed recently, collaborative filtering CF recommendation technique and has been used in a number of different applications such as recommending web pages, movies, articles and products [7, 8, 9]. The CF assumes that a good way to 


find a certain customers interesting content is to find other people who have similar interests with him/her The goal of the CF is to suggest new items or to predict the utility of a certain item for a particular user based on the users previous likings and the opinions of other like-minded users [10][11 2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications 978-0-7695-3982-9/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/ICCEA.2010.167 55 B. WebCF-AR method A model-based recommendation methodology is WebCF-AR1  that addresses the sparsity and the scalability problems of existing CF-based recommender systems. Web usage mining analyzes customers shopping behaviors on the Web and collects their implicit ratings. This increases the number of ratings rather than obtaining subjective ratings, thereby reduces the sparsity [12][13 C. weighted RFM- based method Although various approaches for making recommendations have been presented, few consider customer lifetime value \(CLV product recommendations. Firms are increasingly recognizing the importance of the lifetime value of customers [14]. Generally, RFM \(Recency Frequency, and Monetary measure CLV [15,16].In fiercely competitive environments, identifying the CLV or loyalty ranking of customer segments is important for helping decision makers to target markets more clearly. [17 D. Association Rule Mining Given a set of transactions where each transaction is a set of items \(item set a knowledge or pattern in the form of  X => Y , where X and Y are item sets; X and Y are called the body and the head, respectively. Association rule mining is the discovery of all association rules that are above a userspecified minimum support and minimum confidence 19,18, 20, 21] [13 E. WebCF-PT method WebCF-PT2 is a recommendation methodology 


based on Web usage mining and the product taxonomy to improve the recommendation quality and the system performance of current CF-based recommender systems. The overall procedure of WebCF-PT is divided into four phases: grain specification, customer profile creation, neighborhood formation, and recommendation generation. The input data consist of Web server log files, product database customer database and purchase database. The endmost output is the personalized product recommendation list. [22  1 Web usage mining driven Collaborative Filtering recommendation methodology using Association Rules 2 Web usage mining driven CF recommendation methodology using Product Taxonomy III. INORM METHOD INORM method is a brand new and inventive method in which costumers' background is investigated, considering what increase the quality of prediction and recommendation and then predicts and recommends the goods they may buy. In this method the advantages of both collaborating filtering method and content base method, based on the products and characteristics are used. Recommendations are chosen according to desired costumers, as well as what the costumer had loved more before.  Moreover grouping and categorizing the products in the same characterized groups, removes the separation problems such as distribution and time wasting features. Also, the usage of goods characteristics after collaborating filtering grouping is used in ending steps of prediction and recommendation which is another way to make the procedure better.  This matter prepares the possibility of recommending new goods to the costumer. This is one of most important advantages of INORM method which can find better market for goods, beside the current method. INROM method uses the advantages of at least six methods and pays attention to some characters such as locality Regency and Frequency of references and so on. For verifying this method, in the Ghazal department 


store3 with different costumer and condition, INORM has executed and the result has shown that the INORM method will increase the ability of predictions and recommendations to more than 25.56 percent. The INORM recommendation method is made of 10 steps in which of them, the characteristics of several former recommendation methods are covered simultaneously In the next section these steps are explained IV. METHODOLOGIES Phase 1: Grain Specification In this phase, we identify similar products and group them together using product taxonomy so as to reduce the product space. [22], [23], [26 Phase 2: Customer Preference Analysis INORM applies the results of analyzing the preferences of each customer to make recommendations. For this purpose, we propose a customer preference model represented by a matrix The customer preference model is constructed based the following three general shopping steps in Web retailers: Click through4, Basket Placement5 Purchase6. So we can classify all products into four product groups such as purchased products, products placed in the basket, products clicked through, and the 3 Ghazal department store, Neshabour, Iran, Manager: Mrs Mahnaz Ghafarian 4 the click on and the view of the Web page of the product 5 the placement of the product in the shopping basket 6 the purchase of the product 56 other products. From the above terminology, we define the customer preference matrix P = \( pij total number of customers total number of grain product classes, i. e., | G c ijp >0o      mi pij p ij m i b 


ij b ij m i c ij c ij ij p p p p p p p 111 c ijp d 0o 0 ijp ijp implies that the preference of customer i across every products in a grain product j depends on the normalized value of total number of occurrences of click-troughs, basket placement and purchases. It ranges from 0 to 3, where more preferred product results in bigger value. [13 Phase 3: determination of goal costumer for recommendation Phase 4: The similarity of preferences among customers can be measured in various ways. A common method is to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient defined as below        Is csc Is 


csc Is csccsc jiP jjii jjii rrrr rrrr cccorr 22       The notations ic r and jc r  denote the average number of products purchased by customer's ci and cj respectively. Moreover, the variable i denotes the group of products. Additionally, the rci,s and rcj,s indicates whether customer's ci and cj purchased group of products \(items    Phase 5: The RFM values of each customer are normalized. The normalized RFM [17] values of each customer are then multiplied by the relative importance of RFM variables, wR, wF and wM, which are determined by the AHP7. The similarity among customers can be measured by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient based on the weighted RFM values of customers, as defined in below. [5], [17  jiWRFM cccorr       Vs csc Vs csc Vs 


csccsc jjii jji WRFMWRFMWRFMWRFM WRFMWRFMWRFMWRFM 2  2        In above Eq i and are the average weighted RFM \(WRFM respectively. The variable V denotes the set of RFM variables. The variables  and which is s indicate the weighted value R \(F or M customer ci and cj. [5, 17 cWRFM cjWRFM sci WRFM , sc jWRFM 7 Analytic Hierarchy Process Phase 6: The integrated correlation coefficient is then derived according to below Eq    int jiPPjiWRFMWRFMccegrated cccorrwcccorrwCorr ji uu wWRFM and wP represent the relative importance weights preferences, respectively. K-means technique is employed to cluster customers based on the integrated correlation coefficients. The centroid of a cluster is represented by both the average WRFM values and the average purchase preferences of customers within the cluster. Customers are assigned to a cluster with maximum integrated correlation coefficient. [5 Phase 7: we define the customer and his/her neighbors preference matrix P = \(P1j total number of customers 1,    , n\( total number of grain product classes, i. e G uuu mi pijmi bijmi cijj PPPP 1111 JED 


P1j implies that the preference of the goal customer and his/her neighbors across every product in a grain product j depends on the normalized value of total number of occurrences of click- through, basket placement and purchases. P1j is a 1n matrix. [27 Phase 8: Product Association Analysis In this phase, we first search for meaningful relationships or associations among grain product classes through mining association rules from the large transactions. In order to capture the customers shopping inclination more accurately, we look for association rules from three different transaction sets purchase transaction set, basket placement transaction set and click-through transaction set. This work results in building a model called product association model represented by a matrix. A product association matrix A = \(aij total number of grain product classes                otherwise jiif jiif jiif jiif a c b p ij 0 25.0 


5.0 1 1 Phase 9: In the 7th and 8th phases, we have built the customer and his/her neighbors preference model and the product association model. A personalized recommendation list for a specific customer is produced by scoring the degree of similarity between the associations of each grain product class and their preferences and by selecting the best scores. Cosine coefficient [7] is used to measure the similarity. The matching score sij between the same group customers and a grain product class j is computed as followings 57     n k kj n k ik n k kjik j i j i ij ap ap AP APS 1 2 1 2 1  [22, 13, 24 Where Pi is the row vector of the 1  n customer 


preference matrix, and Aj is the j- th column vector of the n  n product association matrix A. Here, n refers the total number of grain product classes. The sij value ranges from 0 to 1, where more similar vector results in bigger value. [22], [24 Phase 10: The 9th phase implies the higher preference of grain product classes for group of the goal costumer. Hence, in that case, we have to choose which products in this grain product class have the highest reference frequency and recommend them to the costumer A. Detection of the results of execution of this method in a sample department store To determine the ability of the INORM method it was necessary to find a database of a department store The costumer's shopping detailed list of the Ghazal department store in 2005 was entered the software designed based on the INORM method, negotiating with that store, there were 41 costumers with different reference frequencies and different shopping Costumers were from different ranges of long time and short time background with deference frequencies of high and low and also high and low money spending capacities and etc. In this database there are 108 different goods and based on the requests these goods are categorized in 21 different categories. The store manager was also asked to form the association matrix of goods, according to her experiences Regarding the market and costumer's condition, the store manager determines the wRFM and wP coefficients and considers them as 0.5. She is also asked to determine the wR, wF and wM, coefficients which are considered as 2, 3 and 3 in order they are named above. [5 B. Experimental metrics Two metrics, precision and recall, are commonly used to measure the quality of recommendation. [5],[17 itemserestingofnumber itemsdrecommendecorrectlyofnumbercall int Re itemsdrecommendeofnumber 


itemsdrecommendecorrectlyofnumberecision  Pr An F1-metric can be used to balance the trade-off between precision and recall F1-metric assigns equal weight to precision and recall and is given by precisionrecall precisionrecallF uu 21   [24 Notably, each metric is computed for each customer and the average value computed for each cluster, as well as the overall average \(over all customers taken as measures of the quality of the recommendation. [17], [13],[5 C. Experimental results With mentioned preparations, 3 manners are considered for execution in which the recommendations are calculated in collaborating filtering and WRFM methods, beside the INORM method. The results are represented here in two tables TABLE  I. Comparison of recommendation quality in tests TABLE  II. comparison of recommendation leading to purchase, determining the number of recommendations in tests Number of equal F1s Number of larger F1s Percentage of F1 to be larger Percentage of F1 to be larger or equal Comparison of INORM with WRFM

For this purpose calculation the recommendation quality, the database should be divided into learning and recommendation data, in this research about 20 percent of information aren't entered to database in order to ask recommendation and then compare them to the true information based on the costumers' name in this method's information. The simulated software answer in three manners \(INORM, WRFM and CF investigated in diagrams after 128 times of executions after that the result are analyzed and investigated. To compare the observed statistics of INORM method with two method which are collaborating filtering and WRFM, one can refer to the table 1 At this observed INORM method increase the quality of recommendation to costumer in comparison with the collaborating filtering to 56.25 percent and represent it in 96.87 equal or better. In the same way in comparison of INORM with WRFM method increase the recommendation quality to 78.12 58 


The priority of INORM method comparing to other ones is obvious now, but we investigated the manner representing recommendation in INORM more regarding the number of recommendations The case in which the numbers of recommendation are 9 the recommendations leading to purchase in INORM method causes 75 percent increase. In CF method such as INORM method, the number of recommendations has 62.5 percent increases in ability of them. After doing tests for more recommendation the results are represented in table 2, which is a great success for INORM method to have more ability than the old methods V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION this article tried to tell the strength and weakness point of the recommendations method in electronic commerce, introducing a new method named INORM which uses the advantages of six current method and weakened their deficiencies , in order to have a new step in good recommendation executing INORM method for recommending to the costumers of a database of a store and its comparison with the recommendations represented by CF method and WRFM , at least 78.125 percent comparing to WRFM and 56.25 percent comparing to CF methods, increase had observed. The INORM method also takes costumer behaviors patterns into account to be useful for all kind of electronic commerce VI.
