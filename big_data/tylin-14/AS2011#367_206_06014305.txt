NONTAXFOLKS:AN APPROACH FOR NON TAXONOMIC RELATION EXTRACTION FROM FOLKSONOMIES As we previously mentioned, identifying non-taxonomic relationships between tags is a compelling issue for the 


ef?cient use of the social bookmarking systems. Indeed with a clear semantic structure, the cloud of tags of the folksonomy can be useful not only for humans, but also to software agents and applications on the semantic web Our hypothesis is that this underlying knowledge can be derived by means of formal analysis of the tags combined with pragmatic informations provided by external resources Therefore, the most salient features of our approach are as follows: \(i the folksonomy analysis and relation identi?cation. This is important due to the use of online lexical resource as well as resources like Google and Wikipedia; \(ii domain independent solution, since no domain assumptions are formulated and no prede?ned knowledge is needed and iii or related tagsets, i.e., a non-empty subsets of tags. The triadic concepts can be used as an access structure for providing important hidden correlations between tags, resources and users. Our approach called NONTAXFOLKS for non taxonomic relationship extraction from folksonomy consists of three steps: 1 3 representation of the NONTAXFOLKS approach A. Pre-processing In folksonomies, tagging information can be noisy and inconsistent [12]. Since, whenever manual tags are introduced with a non-controlled tagging mechanism, people often make grammatical mistakes \(e.g. webdesgn instead of webdesign or derived forms \(start, starts, starting adjectives, adverbs, prepositions or pronouns are added to the main concept of the tag \(beautiful car, to read use synonyms and acronyms that could be converted into a single tag \(Web and WWW, hk and hong kong Hence, in order to facilitate the folksonomy data analysis and integration, the vocabularies used in the folksonomy are shaped into following four categories [13 1- Standard tags: which can be found in traditional dictionaries 2- Compound tags: a non-standard expression, e.g., web design 3- Jargon tags: another non-standard expression frequently 


used to quickly express users ideas, e.g., hk and folksonomy 4 Other nonsense tags: such as misspelling tags, e.g desgn The pre-processing step is a sequential execution where the input stands in the set of tags T retrieved from a folksonomy. The output from one pre-processing step is used as input to the next one. The output of the whole pre-processing stage is a set of frequent tagsets that corresponds to an Figure 2. The NONTAXFOLKS approach at a glance 371 Table I A TRIADIC CONTEXT/folksonomy Objects/Attributes-Links r1 r2 r3 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 u1 u2 u3 u4 u5 u6 u7 agreed representation. Hence, in order to perform correctly this step, we have considered three external resources 1 group English words into sets of cognitive synonyms called synsets, providing de?nitions of terms, and modeling various semantic relations between concepts synonym, hypernym, hyponym, among others 2 free-content encyclopedia on the Internet. Wikipedia contains collaboratively generated categories that classify and relate entries, and also supports term disambiguation and dereferencing of acronyms 3 searched term is entered, the Google engine checks whether more relevant search results are found with an alternative spelling. Since Googles spell check is based on occurrences of all words on the Internet, it is able to suggest common spellings for proper nouns that would not appear in a standard dictionary As it will be explained below, we have additionally used 


a number of software components such as syntactic ?lters and semantic ?lters. Deck 1 in Fig. 2 provides a visual representation of the pre-processing process where a set of tags is generated from a folksonomy tags and transformed into a set of frequent tagsets. Each step in the pre-processing deck corresponds to a step outlined below Step 1: Consolidate tags The goal of this step is to clean and enrich the users generated tag. Hence, for each tag, different ?ltering stages are performed to retrieve a related set of cleaned and enriched tags. However, contrarily to both [3] and [14], a selected tag t is not discarded after each stage but added to a set of tagsets called Setagset, where each tagset contains the users tag t and SNewtags, i.e., the set of new tags generated in each stage. Hence, we have: Setagset = {\(t SNewtags In the following, we describe the tag consolidate stages which are visually described by Fig. 3 1 5 http://wordnet.princeton.edu 6 http://en.wikipedia.org 7 http://www.google.com lower case and special characters, such as accents dieresis and caret symbol, are converted to their base form. For example, the tag Zurich is converted to Zurich. Additionally, common stop-words, such as pronouns, articles, prepositions and conjunctions are discarded. The transformed tag tj is added to the set of SNewtags. Hence, the set Setagset is updated as follows Setagset = Setagset ? {\(ti, SNewtags 2 transformed tag tj is a standard one, i.e., the tag has an exact matching with an entry in WordNet. In this case, we return back to the stage \(1 next tag from T 3 representation of tj , we check whether this tag is a jargon one. In such case, we correlate it to its appropriate Wikipedia entry. For example, when searching the tag hk in Wikipedia, the entry with the title Hong Kong is retrieved. Hence, this title is added to the set 


SNewtags and the next tag from T is selected. The advantage of using Wikipedia to agree on tags from folksonomies is that Wikipedia is a community-driven knowledge base, much like folksonomies are, so that it rapidly adapts to accommodate new terminology 4 one, i.e., nonsense tag, e.g., webdesgn, we consider possible misspellings, e.g., webdesign and/or compound nouns, e.g., web design. Inspired from the Tag transformation Syntactic filtring Standard tag Wikipedia correlation Tag correction Jargon tag Misspeling/Compound tag Setagset Tags Figure 3. Consolidate tags stages representation 372 work of [3], to solve these problems, we make use of Google which suggests a common spelling for tj e.g., web design. Therefore, the suggested term is added to the set SNewtags and the next tag from T is selected Example 3: Let us consider the users generated tag ti webdesgn;. Then, by performing the ?rst stage, we obtain SNewtags= {webdesgn and Setagset = Setagset ? {\(webdesgn webdesgn Since webdesgn is nonsense tag as expected by the two previously stages, i.e., Syntactic ?ltering and Wikipedia correlation stages, the 4th stage, i.e., tag correction, is performed. Hence we will have SNewtags = {webdesgn, web design and Setagset = Setagset ? {\(webdesgn;, {webdesgn web design Note that the consolidate tags step comes to and end after 


handling all the tags of T Step 2: Group similar tags Another issue to be considered during the tags preprocessing step is that users often use morphologically similar terms to refer to the same idea. Hence, in this step we are interested in discovering the set SSimtagset of similar tagsets among the previously retrieved set of tagsets i.e., Setagset. Indeed, one very common example of this is the no discrepancy between singular and plural terms, such as start and starts, and other morphological deviations e.g., starting. In this step, we use a stemming algorithm provided by Lucene8 which reduces morphologically similar tags, e.g., starting, starts and start, to the root tag, i.e start. Hence, for each set of similar tagsets, the shortest term found in Wordnet is used as the representative tag, i.e start Example 4: Let us consider a Setagset containing four tagsets as follows Setagset= {\(desgn;, {desgn, design hk, {hk, hong kong hongkong, {hongkong, hong kong designer designer Thus, by performing the group similar terms step SSimtagset will be equal to: {SSimtagset1 SSimtagset2 SSimtagset1 = \(design desgn;, {desgn, design designer, {designer SSimtagset2 = \(hong kong hk, {hk, hong kong hongkong, {hongkong, hong kong Note that the ?rst element of both SSimtagset1 and SSimtagset2, i.e., respectively design, hong kong, are agged as the representative tags 8 An open-source search engine that provides full text indexing and searching capabilities, http://lucene.apache.org Step 3: Group synonym tags As a ?at collection of terms, typically a folksonomy present the problem of synonymy control. People can use different tags with the same meaning, e.g., Mac and Macintosh are used to describe Macintosh computers Tackling the issue of similarity of meanings is of high importance for extracting meaningful relationships between 


tags. However, only a few algorithms have been proposed to handle tags synonymy problem, by mainly focussing on clustering similar tags together using mostly similarity metrics In Szomszor et al. [14], the authors present an algorithm for the tag merging by synonymy. The proposed algorithm performs the task in three stages: \(i matrix of synonyms by using WordNet; \(ii non-ambiguous synonym and; \(iii synonym pairs with the term that is most popular. Even though this can be of help ?nding a pair of synonym tags it can somewhat restrict synonym tags discovery. Indeed if a synonymy between a pair of tags is found, the pair is directly replaced by the synonym term without further checking, whereas one of the tags pair may have other synonyms. In the following, we introduce a new algorithm called EXTRACTSYNTAGSET, that investigates all possible synonymys relationships between tags. Thus, EXTRACTSYNTAGSET searches in WordNet synonyms candidate in folksonomy by invoking the SEARCHSYN procedure. Moreover, contrarily to the Szomszor et al. approach, [14], the extracted set of tags synonyms is added to the set of synonyms tagsets, i.e., SSyntagset, for tags meanings enrichment. The pseudo-code of EXTRACTSYNTAGSET is sketched by Algorithm 1, whereas the used notations are summarized in Table II EXTRACTSYNTAGSET takes as input the set SSimtagset resulting from the previous step and outputs the set SSyntagset, which contains the representative tags with their associated synonyms. The EXTRACTSYNTAGSET procedure operates as follows: in Lines 2-3, it initializes the set SL by the ?rst representative tag in the set of representatives tags extracted from SSimtagset, i.e., RT , and an empty set, i.e., all synonyms of the tag occurring in folksonomy must not be retrieved later in the search procedure, and initializes the set SSyntagset to the empty set From Line 4 to 21, the algorithm iteratively searches for synonym tags corresponding to the representative tag in the folksonomy. This is done until the set SL becomes empty Thus, in each iteration, STagset is initialized by tagsets associated to st1.tag in SSimtagset where st1 is the ?rst 


element in SL In Line 7, EXTRACTSYNTAGSET invokes the SEARCHSYN procedure to search for synonym tags, i.e., SS . Thereafter, in Lines 8-9, st1 and the related tag st1.tag are respectively removed from SL and RL 373 Table II NOTATIONS USED IN THE EXTRACTSYNTAGSET ALGORITHM SSimtagset : The set of tagsets which contains all equivalent tags and their representative tag SSyntagset : The set of tagsets which contains all synonym tags and their representative tag RT : The set of representatives tags extracted from SSimtagset STagset : The set of tagsets which contains the representative tag and the associated synonyms SL : The set of pairs \(tag, notSynTags SS : The set of synonym tags of the representative tag Next, cf., Lines 10-18, EXTRACTSYNTAGSET selects each tag t from SS and checks whether it has not been treated yet In such case, EXTRACTSYNTAGSET checks whether it is already inserted in SL, i.e., it has been retrieved with another tag, then st1.tag have to be added to the set t.notSynTags Otherwise, a new entry associated to t must be created with a set containing st1.tag and added to the set SL At end of the iteration \(outer loop its set of synonyms tagsets, i.e., STagset, is added to SSyntagset. Thereafter, cf., Lines 20-21, if RT = ? and SL = ?, then EXTRACTSYNTAGSET adds a new entry to the set of pairs. Otherwise, the algorithm comes to an end with the set SSyntagset Step 4: Filter infrequent tagsets Filter out tags occurring less than a certain threshold B. Group related tags The second step of NONTAXFOLKS is to identify groups of related tag, i.e., representative tag in folksonomy. Approches using clustering or statical similarity metrics techniques for the organisation of related tags into clusters are widely used. Hence, in [5], the author uses a subsumption based model, derived from the co-occurrence of tags, to ?nd groups or related tags. On the other hand, Begelman et al 15] organise the tag space as an undirected graph, repre 


senting co-occurring tags as vertices, weighting the edges between them according to their co-occurrence frequency and applying a spectral clustering algorithm to re?ne the resulting groups. However, in such approches, correlation between tags, users and resources are often lost. Indeed, a semantically relation between tags is usually discovered if they had been assigned by users with similar interests. On the other hand, related resources are usually tagged many times by semantically related tags and ?nally users may have similar interests if they share many resources in their assignments In [4], the author use co-occurrence information to build graphs relating tags with users and tags with resources and applies techniques of network analysis to discover sets of clusters of semantically related tags. Similarly, in our proposed approach, we make use of the semantic relatedness embodied in the different frequencies of co-occurences among users, resources and tags in the social bookmarking Algorithm 1: EXTRACTSYNTAGSET Data: SSimtagset : {\(rt, {tagset Result: SSyntagset : {\(rt, {tagset Begin1 SL = {\(RT [1 T S = ?;3 While SL = ? do4 st1 = SL[1];5 STagset = {tagsets1 | ? \(st1.tag, tagsets1 SSimtagset SS = SEARCHSYN\(st1 RT = RT \\ {st1.tag};8 SL = SL \\ {st1};9 Foreach tag t ?

SSyntagset = SSyntagset ? {\(st1.tag,19 STagset If RT = ? ? SL = ? then20 SL = {\(RT [1 return SSyntagset ;22 End23 system, i.e., folksonomy. However, instead of using probabilistic models or network analysis techniques for grouping related tags, we mine frequent triadic concepts. Indeed, the triadic concept structure describes three types of sets: \(i set T of related tags; \(ii i.e., users whose have tagged by T and; \(iii resources, i.e., which were assigned with T by users U Hence, triadic concepts allow grouping semantically related tags taking into account the Users tagging behavior in a folksonomy In fact, in [16] and [11], the authors have considered a folksonomy as a triadic context and proposed an algorithm called TRIAS to get out implicit shared conceptualizations formally sketched by triadic concepts. TRIAS takes as input a folksonomy F := \(U , T, R, Y by its representative tag beforehand identi?ed, i.e., trep, as well as three user-de?ned thresholds : u ? minsupp, t minsupp and r ?minsupp. The TRIAS algorithm outputs the set of all frequent T C that ful?ll these aforementioned 374 thresholds Hence, running TRIAS algorithm on the triadic context depicted by Table I, with u ?minsupp = 2, t ?minsupp 2 and r?minsupp = 2 yields the following tri-concepts T C1 = {\(u1, u2, u3, u5, u7 t2, t3, t4 r1, r2, r3 T C2 = {\(u5, u6, u7 t4, t5 r1, r2 T C3 = {\(u2, u3, u4, u7 t1, t4 r2, r3 After the group related tags step, we present in the following the extraction of non-taxonomic relationships C. Non-taxonomic relationship extraction In the following, we introduce an algorithm called NTREXTRACTION for extracting non-taxonomic relationships between pairs of tags picked from the triadic concepts structure. As we previously mentioned, two tasks have to be carried out for learning non-taxonomic relationships: \(i 


discovery and selection of all pairs of related tags; \(ii discovery and selection of predicates, i.e., non taxonomic labels, used for expressing non taxonomic relationships between the pairs of tags according to their semantic meaning Notations used in this algorithm are summarized in Table III The pseudo-code of the NTREXTRACTION algorithm is sketched by Algorithm 2. NTREXTRACTION takes as input two sets: the set of triadic concepts T C and the set of representative tags. NTREXTRACTION outputs the set of all non-taxonomic relationships candidates NT R between tags discovered from T C. NTREXTRACTION operates as follows: ?rstly, NTREXTRACTION discovers all pairs of concepts from the sets of tags contained in the tri-concepts structure. For performing this task and to avoid the useless computation of pairs, NTREXTRACTION invokes the procedure DESCSORTTC which sorts the set of tri-concepts in a descending order with respect to the size of the tag set Line 4 Thereafter, NTREXTRACTION, cf., Lines 10-20, extracts the set of non-taxonomic relationships from each pair of tags. Speci?cally, in Line 11, NTREXTRACTION invokes the SEARCHWIKIPEDIA procedure to identify from Wikipedia sentences containing both tags \(ti, tj we use sentences as text units for analysis since they are Table III NOTATIONS USED IN THE NTREXTRACTION ALGORITHM T C : The set of all frequent tri-concepts T : The set of representative tags NT R : The set of non-taxonomic relationships extracted from Wikipedia T T S : The list of sets of tags which have been used to extract pairs PS : The set of pairs \(ti, tj tri-concepts ST C : Sorted list of tri-concepts SSent : Set of sentences extracted from Wikipedia Stree : Syntactic tree of sentence Algorithm 2: NTREXTRACTION Data 1 2 Result: NT R : {Non-taxonomic relationships Begin1

Thus, in the inner loop \(Lines 12-20 NTREXTRACTION invokes the PARSESENTENCE procedure which uses the Stanford Parser to generate a Treebank parse tree for each input sentence Example 5: The parse tree for the sentence S = The concept of open source and free sharing of technological information has existed long before computers existed.. The triplet, i.e., < subject, predicate, object >, is extracted out from this sentence. Since \(S a tree having three children: a noun phrase \(NP concept of open source and free sharing of technological information, a verbal phrase \(V P before computers existed and the full stop TRACTSUBJECT procedure extracts the NP and searches for a mapping with at least one tag of the selected pair 


ti, tj open source, long 375 procedure extracts the compound verb from V P , i.e., has existed. Similarly, the EXTRACTOBJECT procedure extracts one of the three phrases: noun phrase NP , adjective phrase ADV P and prepositional phrase PP Once identi?ed, the set NT R of non-taxonomic relationships candidates have to be pruned to withdraw all infrequent relations. Hence, we make use of Borgelts ef?cient implementation of the APRIORI algorithm for frequent termsets extraction [17]. In the following, we remind some de?nition that will be of need in the sequel De?nition 6: An extraction context is a triplet K NT R, E , M taxonomic relationships, E is a ?nite set of terms and M is a binary \(incidence i.e., M ? NT R  E couple \(ntr, e ntr ? NT R contains the item e ? E Example 6: An example of an extraction context K is depicted by Table IV with O = {ts1, ts2, ts3, ts4, ts5, p1 p2, p3, p4, p5, to1, to2, to3, to4, to5} and I = {ntr1, ntr2 ntr3, ntr4, ntr5, ntr6, ntr7 De?nition 7: A termset9 E is said to be frequent if Supp\(E threshold, denoted minsup. The set of frequent termsets will be denoted FEK Note that we have added a restriction in the APRIORI implementation algorithm for considering only possible combinations between frequent terms. Since only two combinations are allowed, i.e., tag subject and predicates and tag subject and tag object. Therefore, once the set FEK is discovered, the association rules must have to derived only from the frequent 3-itemsets. Indeed, we paid attention to association rules of the form R: ts, to?p, where ts denotes a subject tag, to denotes an object tag and p denotes a predicate Example 7: Given the extraction context depicted by Table IV with minsup = 2 and minconf = 0.5, the derived valid association rules are given by the following table ts1, to4 ? p1 \(2, 0.5 ts1, to4 ? p2 \(2, 0.5 ts3, to4 ? p3 \(2, 1.0 


V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The problem of evaluating non-taxonomically related concepts is quite complex since the non-taxonomic relationships are rarely contained in a gold standard. Hence, few experimental evaluations have been reported for comparing ontologies on the lexical as well as on the taxonomic level, e.g., [18] compares the generated ontology by their methodology against category structure from Open Directory 9 Note that each term may refer to a tag subject, a tag object or a predicate Project10 \(ODP  evaluation of the resulting ontology structure by comparing it to an ontology extracted from sei.cmu.edu and cluster from FLICKR. In fact, an investigation of the structure of existing ontologies via the Swoogle ontology search engine [19] has shown that domain ontologies very occasionally model this kind of relationships. Due to the problem of ?nding gold standards with good non-taxonomic relationships coverage and the amount of the obtained results, a manual evaluation is not reliable. So, we will focus the evaluation step on objective and automatic assessments. In this case, due to the lack of general purpose automatic evaluation procedures new mechanisms should be designed. In the following, we present an approach to evaluate non taxonomic relationships results in an automatic way against an electronic general domain repository: WordNet A. The dataset description We investigate the tag sets in DEL.ICIO.US thanks to both its popularity and availability. In fact, DEL.ICIO.US is a fast growing social bookmarking service. It offer hosts its users to centrally collect and share their bookmarks, which can refer to any resource on the web as long as this resource can be identi?ed by an URL. When adding a bookmark, users can provide a description, by default the title of the web site, an extended description and tags they consider related A bookmark can be added by going to the DEL.ICIO.US web site or, more conveniently, by using one of the many browser plug-ins which make bookmarking to a social bookmarking system as easy as browser wise bookmarking DEL.ICIO.US went online in September 2003 and is still constantly growing. Hence, we apply our NONTAXFOLKS approach on a snapshot11 described in the following table

Evaluation measures Assessing semantic similarity between words is a central issue in many research ?elds such as Psychology Linguistics, Cognitive Science, Biomedicine, and Arti?cial Intelligence. Semantic similarity can be exploited to improve accuracy of current Information Retrieval techniques, e.g 20], to discover mapping between ontology entities [21], to validate or repair mappings [22] or to perform word-sense disambiguation [23]. As a matter of fact, semantic similarity is relevant in many research areas and therefore, designing accurate methods is mandatory for improving the performance of the bulk of applications relying on it. Basically similarity or distance methods, e.g., [24] aims at assessing a score between a pair of words by exploiting a semantic 10 http://www.dmoz.org 11 http://data.dai-labor.de/corpus/delicious 376 Table IV AN EXTRACTION CONTEXT Relations/Terms ts1 ts2 ts3 ts4 p1 p2 p3 p4 to1 to2 to3 to4 ntr1 ntr2 ntr3 ntr4 ntr5 ntr6 ntr7 ntr8 network such as WordNet. Different relatedness measures implemented by WordNet::Similarity12 are proposed Given that the basis for the assessment of a relationship between a pair of terms13 comes back to statistical scores computed between terms. In this respect, we use the Jiang relatedness metric [25] that de?nes the link strength between two terms, i.e., e1 and e2. Thus, we have distJIANG\(e1, e1 e1 e2 LCA\(e1, e2 Where LCA\(e1,e2 de?ned in WordNet taxonomy and IC\(ei i ? {1,2 describes the information content of a term e which is de?ned as the negative log likelihood of the probability of 


encountering a related term, i.e. IC\(c e intuition behind the use of the negative likelihood is that the more probable a term to appear, the less information it conveys. All these features show that Jiangs measure tends to be more general and more appropriate for evaluating nontaxonomically related terms. Indeed, a high score of the relatedness measures suggests a strong relationship between terms Nevertheless, all relatedness measures have limitations because they assume that all the semantic content of a particular term is modeled by semantic links in WordNet Consequently, in many situations, truly related terms obtain a low scores even though their belongings to a certain category of tags, e.g., jargon tags Additionally, when measuring the quality of an automatically knowledge acquisition results, the typical measures used in Information Retrieval are Recall, Precision and F-Measure. However, computing Recall and F-Measure requires the availability of a Gold Standard. Hence, we will only compute the Precision which speci?es to which extent the non-taxonomic relationships is extracted correctly. In this case, the ratio between the correctly extracted relations i.e., their relatedness measures is greater than or equal to a minimum threshold, and the whole number of extracted ones is computed. Thus, we have Precision Total correctly selected entities Total selected entities 12 http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-Similarity 13 A term refers to a tag subject or a tag object C. Evaluation of non-taxonomic relationships Only a percentage of the full set of non-taxonomic relationships \(89 is caused by the presence of non standard terms which are not contained in WordNet and, in consequence, cannot be evaluated using WordNet-based relatedness measures. Fig. 5 depicts the evaluation results of the extracted non-taxonomic relationships against their relatedness measures High relatedness score \(88 17% of the extracted relationships, as most of terms are strongly related with respect WordNet Null Scores were obtained for 5% of the extracted 


relationships. Analyzing this case in more detail, we have observed that the poor score is caused in many situations by the way in which Jiangs distance metric works. This latter completely depends on the distance between two terms based on the number of edges found on the path between them in WordNet. In consequence this measure returns a value that does not fully represent reality. For example, on the one hand, Jiangs distance metric returns a null value for the relationship between insurance and car, even though the ?rst is a commonly related to the second, i.e., car involved insurance Finally with a minimal Jiangs distance metric threshold, set to 46%, the computed precision of correctly extracted relationships candidates is equal to 68.8 An example of extracted non-taxonomic relationships is depicted in Table V where each relation describes the subject tag, e.g., tool, the predicate, e.g is being developed within, and the object tag, e.g mesh. Fig. 4 represent a fragment output of the extracted ontological structure where each concept de?nes a set of similar and synonym tags and labels, i.e., mentions has been, revealed, caused and is created with describe the predicates of the non-taxonomic relationships between terms Due to the limitations observed by the automatic evaluation procedure and the lack of gold standards containing non-taxonomic relationships, we have examined the extracted non-taxonomic relationships from a linguistic point 377 Top space      distance     quad great     groovy nifty caused address      addresses extension      quotation   reference  references extensions        referenz     source      refrence sources    rfrences    quotations research    search     searching searchs open-source     open_source

This qualitative evaluation can bring some interesting insights about the kind of results one can expect Invalid relations are extracted: Even though a relation such as music cities skill is considered as correct one since tag subject, tag object and predicate are correctly extracted. From a semantic point of view, this relation has no meaning. Hence, a higher precision is expected Figure 5.

obtained results VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK The extraction of non-taxonomic relationships from folksonomies is to the best of our knowledge is the least tackled task within ontology building from folksonomy. This is why there is a need of novel and general purpose approaches covering the full process of learning relationships. In this paper, we introduced a new approach called NONTAXFOLKS that starts by pre-processing tags aiming at getting a set of frequent tagsets corresponding to an agreed representation Then, they are used to retrieve related tags using external resources such as WordNet. Thanks to the particular structure of triadic concepts, it allows grouping semantically related tags by considering the semantic relatedness embodied in the different frequencies of co-occurences among users, resources and tags in the folksonomy. Thereafter we introduced an algorithm called NTREXTRACTION for extracting non-taxonomic relationships between pair of tags picked from the triadic concepts. In summary, our approach uses several well known techniques \(such as formal concept analysis or association rule discovering the social bookmaring environnement in order to propose a new way of extracting labeled non-taxonomic relationships between tags. Currently, we are investigating the following topic concerning the discovered predicates between two terms. Indeed, in order to avoid relationships redundancy and thus a redundancy in the builded ontology. One can try to classify them into prede?ned semantic classes, detect synonyms, inverses, etc. A standard classi?cation of verbs could be used for this purpose, adding additional information about the semantic content, e.g., senses, verb types, thematic roles, etc., of predicates relationships 378 REFERENCES 1] J.
