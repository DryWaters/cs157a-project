        Step 6: Using elimination method in step 3 to the submatrixes and Qi queue  by decreasing order until no new sub-matrix can be divided out Step 7: Selecting the combination of rows in the submatrixes According to the minimum support threshold and rows and columns selected in advance in step 3, the number of row which Qi is more than minimum support threshold will be selected out. Selected rows will be combined. The number of possible combinations is r nC : n is the number of rows selected; r is the minimum support threshold Because there are rows or columns selected in advance in step 3, it is necessary to take into account this factor There are four cases discussed The case 1: there is no selected rows and columns in advance Because no selected rows and columns in advance, this case can be dealt with according to normal conditions The case 2: there is rows selected in advance Because there are the rows selected in advance, the number of rows to be selected can be reduced. The number of possible combinations is r t n tC  t is the number of rows selected in advance. In this way, computation can be reduced to improve the algorithm efficiency The case 3: there is columns selected in advance Because there are the columns selected in advance these columns become the part of the maximal frequent itemset. These columns do not change the method. In the 


end, these columns are only added to maximal frequent itemset selected The case 4: there are selected rows and columns in advance The case 4 is the combination of the case 2 and the case 3 According to the case 2, we can use the way to reduce the number of rows. By the case 3, we can use the way to add the columns selected in advance to the maximal frequent itemset, together with the composition of maximal frequent itemset Step 8: Searching for maximal frequent itemset. In accordance with the selected combination of rows, all of one-itemset supports Pi are computed out. The maximal frequent itemset is composed of itemset which the oneitemset supports Pi equals to minimum support threshold The number of the items in the itemset is the maximal frequent itemset length I4 I5 I6 1 1 1 3 1 1  2 1 1 2 2 2 I3 I6 1  1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1421 4 B.an example To explain the use of the above algorithm, the following will illustrate an example Transaction database D is as shown in table 6. Let minimum support threshold be min_s = 2 TABLE VI.  TRANSACTION DATABASE D       


     Step 1: Setting up an associated matrix. It is as shown in table 7 TABLE VII.  ASSOCIATED MATRIX             Step 2: Calculating the one-itemset support Pi and one-transaction frequent itemset Qj. All Pi are \(6,7,6,1,2 All Qj are  \(3,1,2,3,2,2,2,4,3 Step 3: Using elimination method to remove the rows and columns of the associated matrix according to certain conditions. Here are items for the I4 column and transaction for T800 row to be eliminated. The I4 column is eliminated by the first condition. The T800 row is eliminated by the forth condition. All Pi are \(5,6,5,1 Qj are \(3,1,2,2,2,2,2,3 is as shown in table 8 TABLE VIII.

Step 4: Qi queue Step 5: Divided into sub-matrix. According to the first row, the matrix can divided into the two sub-matrixes They are as shown in table 9 and 10 TABLE IX.  FIRST SUB-MATRIX            TABLE X.  SECOND SUB-MATRIX         Step 6: Using elimination method to the sub-matrixes and Qi queue by descending order From table 8, T100 row may be eliminated by forth condition. It is as shown in table 11 TABLE XI.   FIRST SUB-MATRIX           As the two rows have been elected, and to meet the minimum support threshold, and therefore, Table 8 Sub

It is as shown in table 13 TABLE XIII.  THE COMBINATION OF T100 AND T800 Two rows of T800 and T900 make up new sub-matrix to search for maximal frequent itemset. It is as shown in table 14 TABLE XIV.  THE COMBINATION OF T800 AND T900      Step 8: Searching for maximal frequent itemset

ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE COMPARISON All the experiments are performed on a AMD Athlon 64*2 Dual core processor 3800+ PC machine with 1G main memory, running on Microsoft Windows XP. All the programs are written in Microsoft Visual C++6.0 Experimental data is generated randomly by programming. And the number of items is 39 Experiment result shows that the efficiency of the counting algorithm is higher in comparison with Apriori algorithm and FP-tree algorithm. It is as shown in Figure 1               Figure 1.  Relationship of the support threshold with time consumption V. CONCLUSION The core of association mining is mining frequent itemset. Directly searching for maximal frequent itemset can increase efficiency of association mining algorithm This paper presents a new mining algorithm looking for Maximal Frequent Itemset. The algorithm with simply counting the value of rows and columns on associated matrix can find out the maximal frequent itemset and greatly simplifies the complexity of association mining algorithm. Analysis and experiments show that this algorithm has obvious advantages ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
