Figure 1 Three Components of Visualization System Investigation component above Projection and Exploration components below The second component can be used to the detailed investigation of temporal patterns and is based on the methods successfully used in biometrics particularly in longest common subsequence analysis of sequences of nucleotides The methods for gene analysis were adjusted to the data structure of GTD using sequences of attacks of terrorist groups instead of sequences in genes for comparison so the component offers the comparison of the behavior of two logical groupings of terroristês events as it changes over time in this place we have to note that the term behavior has the quite different meaning that meaning as we use in this paper in the following text The third component supports e xploration of relationships among dimensions in more abstract manner than previous two components This component shows degree of correlation between categorical dimensions attributes using ribbons that are sized based on the number of cases two categories share This component is very illustrative for smaller amount of categories and is very useful while focusing on speciìc small subset of groups categories which we want to analyze But in the case of large amount of categories in GTD there are for example more than thousands of different terroristic groups hundreds of countries where attacks are committed it can be almost impossible to get comprehensible visualization With this tool it is also possible to explore the relations among categories of more than two attributes dimensions but with multiplying the number of categories from all the dimensions it brings another difìculty in understanding of visualizations To solve this problem of large amount of categories we have created the method that lters very effectively the data preserving only interesting or important relations in data captured by what we call typical behavior described later in text The interestingness or the importance can be deìned using some tunable parameters for ltering in selected data mining method Filtered relations are then presented graphically in synthetic social network for further visual investigation you can see the example on Fig.2 Figure 2 Graph of Synthetic Social Network In the rst step of the method the user can discover interesting similarities among all terroristic groups in GTD and in the the second step of the method the user can reveal communities groups of terroristic groups which can be afterwards investigated more speciìcally using the similarity or vice versa difference among them by the means of the related methods mentioned above III T YPICAL B EHAVIOR A NALYSIS Our intention is to extend the visualization system mentioned in previous section with complementary tool for the visualization of all the information in GTD by the means of what we call typical behavior of individual terroristic group and to present it graphically using a synthetic social network This approach can serve us the exploration of GTD in the global scope which can allows us the analyzing of interesting similarities among all the terroristic groups in the data collection Furthermore we can continue with the exploration of the data in more speciìc focus as mentioned before In the rst subsection we formally deìne what we mean by the expression behavior  in the second subsection we discuss the mean of the adjective typical  A Behavior Suppose we have data D  o  X   where 1 o   o 1   o  m   is set of some objects processes transactions etc 2 X   X 1   X n  is set of variables attributes 3 x j i are values of i th attribute measured on j th object formally 2 X i  o   n i is mapping deìned as 2 We use notation  n   1   n    n  N i.e  3  1  2  3   256 2011 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks CASoN 


X i  o j  x j i   i   n  j   m we do not restrict  n i to be a set of natural numbers it can be any nite set of categories as every set of categories can be mapped to a set of natural number we use  n i just for simpliìcation of notation 3  To form groups of objects which to compare them among each other we select one attribute from X more precisely we select attribute index z   n  Therefore in later text we call selected attribute X z as z-attribute  which we use to separate objects from data D into n z different classes these classes are noted as z-categories  Generally speaking as behavior of z-category cat z   n z we understand the distribution of objects from this zcategory over all i-categories i-category is similarly deìned as set of objects satisfying condition X i  o j  l l   n i i   z  To investigate the relations among categories of more than two attributes i.e among X z and more than one iattribute we formally deìne the behavior of z-category cat z   n z on sets of i-categories cat i 1   n i 1   cat i k   n i k as Deìnition 1 Let i   i 1   i k   i   n k   n z   i  z   n D are data in form described above in this section Behavior of z-category cat z   n z on sets of i-categories cat i 1   n i 1   cat i k   n i k is mapping B D X z X i 1 X i k   n z   n i 1     n i k  0  1 deìned as B D X z X i 1 X i k  cat z cat i 1   cat i k   X z  cat z  X i 1  cat i 1    X i k  cat i k  D   X z  cat z  D  1 where  Cond  D denotes number of object from data D satisfying condition Cond  With this deìnition we can compute behavior of zcategories on set resulting from Cartesian product of k icategories   n i 1     n i k  which can be represented in form of k dimensional matrix of behavior values Then for one z-category and for one set of cardinality k of i-attributes  X i 1   X i k  we can compute  k l 1 n i l values of B D X z X i 1 X i k and for every k  n  1 we can combine  n  1 k  sets of iattributes from set of all i-attributes what together involve  B z  D   n  1 k 1   i 1 i k     n k    j   k   i j   z   k l 1 n i l  computations needed for proper comparison among all zcategories for given z we note   n k  all k tuples from  n k   n  4  It can be seen that  B z  D  grows very rapidly while n and n i s are growing It is neither very efìcient nor necessary to compute all values of behavior to compare individual z-categories More efìcient way to compute only typical elements of behavior is discussed in next subsection 3 It implies that attributes with continuous inìnite domain needs to be categorized before starting the

The extracted information can be applied in the prediction process or for construction of classiìcation models using the relations within the data records or between the data collections This type of information can be valuable in the decision making process and forecast the effects of those decisions The proposed model then can be helpful in the identiìcation process of the attacker or known terrorist group in the situations when incident occurs A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partially supported by the grant of Silesian University Czech Republic No SGS/24/2010 Usage of BI and BPM Systems to Efìciency Management Support R EFERENCES  D J Hand P  Smyth and H Mannila Principles of Data Mining  Cambridge MA USA MIT Press 2001  L C Freeman The Development of Social Network Analysis A Study in the Sociology of Science  Empirical Press 2004  J Lee Exploring global terrorism data A web-based visualization of temporal data ACM Crossroads  vol 15 no 2 pp 7Ö16 2008  A Godwin R Chang R K osara and W  Ribarsk y  V isual analysis of entity relationships in global terrorism database in SPIE Defense and Security Symposium  2008  J Jones R Chang T  Butkie wicz and W  Ribarsk y  V isualizing uncertainty for geographical information in global terrorism database in SPIE Defense and Security Symposium  2008  R K osara F  Bendix and H Hauser   P arallel sets Interacti v e exploration and visual analysis of categorical data Journal TVCG IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics  vol 12 no 4 pp 558Ö568 2006  X W ang E Miller  K  Smarick W  Ribarsk y  and R Chang Investigative visual analysis of global terrorism database Journal of Computer Graphics Forum  vol 27 no 3 pp 919Ö926 2008  R Agra w al T  Imieli  nski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases SIGMOD Rec  vol 22 pp 207Ö216 June 1993 A v ailable http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/170036.170072  P  Hajek and T  Ha vranek Mechanizing hypothesis formation  Springer-Verlag 1978  P  Hajek I Ha v el and M Chytil The guha method of automatic hypotheses determination Computing  vol 1 pp 293Ö308 1966  M SIMUNEK  Academic kdd project lisp-miner   Advances in Soft Computing Systems Design and Applications  vol 4 pp 263Ö272 2003  S W asserman and K F aust Social Network Analysis  Cambridge Cambridge University Press 1994  P  J Carrington J Scott and S W asserman Models and Methods in Social Network Analysis  Cambridge University Press 2005  J Han and M Kamber  Data Mining Concepts and Techniques  Elsevier Science Ltd 2006  J Hopcroft O Khan B K ulis and B Selman Natural communities in large linked networks in KDD 03 Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  New York NY USA ACM 2003 pp 541Ö546  S Asur  S  P arthasarathy  and D Ucar   An e v ent-based framework for characterizing the evolutionary behavior of interaction graphs in KDD 07 Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  New York NY USA ACM 2007 pp 913Ö921  J Sun C F aloutsos S P apadimitriou and P  S Y u  Graphscope Parameter-free mining of large time-evolving graphs in KDD 07 Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  New York NY USA ACM 2007 pp 687Ö696  D J Fenn M A Porter  M  McDonald S W illiams N F  Johnson and N S Jones Dynamic communities in multichannel data An application to the foreign exchange market during the 20072008 credit crisis Chaos  vol 19 p 033119 2009  D Chakrabarti R K umar  and A T omkins Ev olutionary clustering in KDD 06 Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  New York NY USA ACM 2006 pp 554Ö560  Y R Lin Y  Chi S Zhu H Sundaram and B L Tseng Facetnet a framework for analyzing communities and their evolutions in dynamic networks in WWW 08 Proceeding of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web New York NY USA ACM 2008 pp 685Ö694    Analyzing communities and their e v olutions in dynamic social networks ACM Trans Knowl Discov Data  vol 3 no 2 pp 1Ö31 2009  M H Dunham Data Mining Introductory and Advanced Topics  Prentice Hall 2003  J Reichardt and S Bornholdt 2006 Mar Statistical mechanics of community detection A v ailable http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0603718  R Lambiotte J C Delv enne and M Barahona 2008 Dynamics and modular structure in networks arXiv:0812.1770  M Rosv all and C T  Ber gstrom Maps of random walks on complex networks reveal community structure Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  vol 105 no 4 pp 1118Ö1123 January 2008 A v ailable http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0706851105 260 2011 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks CASoN 


iptable Since this system regards fuzzy association rules detected by packet flow information as its basis for judgment and packet flow may affect setup of certain parameters, it is suggested that the simulating tests and the actual tests should be in the same position of the whole network topology to receive better detection results. When doing simulating tests we collect packets in a specific position of network topology for three hours and make sure if there are DoSIDDoS attacks before simulating set of fuzzy association rules for comparison. The concrete steps are as follows: gathering packet traffic statistics once per unit time\(2 seconds calculating twelve required signature values and forming the fi d f 5400 . I '  r 0 :!> i :!> 5399    h Irst recor 0 III tota , wrItten as ' \( I IS t e serial number of record Then we try to average the total sum of records with the same remainder when 3 is divided by the serial number and the three averaged records will better display the state of network traffic in a certain period. Last, the three records is used to figure out a set of fuzzy association rules for matching. Particularly,network traffic condition differs greatly in different period. In order to get better detection results and reduce false positive rate, fuzzy association rules for individual matching is required in the experiments aiming at different periods, such as morning, noon, afternoon evening and night In practical tests, a record is also formed by twelve signature values of packet traffic statistics gathered once per unit time \(2 seconds worked out by three accumulated records, we compute the similar degree between it and the rules produced in experimental periods. If the similar degree is lower than threshold, it is decided that there are attacks. Once attacks occur, this system cannot automatically update the firewall to block connection unless source of such attacks have been traced Network attacks vary a lot. A complete intrusion detection system is usually constituted by a number of detection modules, each of which is responsible for detecting certain type of attacks. On the other hand, given to considerations of instantaneity, more than one detection module will be more convenient for parallel processing. Any 


intelligent judgment depends upon the selection of signature but different signatures are required to effectively detect different types of attacks. This system mainly aims at DoSIDDoS. Based on Information Gain values, the selected 12 signatures are arrayed in descending order as follows O. number of different payload length 1. number of different source IP address 2. number of different destination IP address 3. number of different TCP source port 4. number of different TCP destination port 5. number of different UDP source port VI-Bl Volume 1 2010 International Conference On Computer Design And Appliations \(ICCDA 2010 6. number of different UDP destination port 7. number of TCP protocol 8. number of UDP protocol 9. number of ICMP protocol 10. number of SYN flags II. number of ACK flags omiscuo --+ __ --.I us Mode capture feature statistics rvfining Fuzzy Association Rules Normal network behavior No Abnormal  behavior Cal culate the value of grades Figure 2. System Flow chart Each signature has three Fuzzy Sets: Low, Medium and High Membership Function in use is taken from Default Function of MATLAB Fuzzy Tool Box \(as follows and c can be adjusted into constants. Figure. 3 is the instance of Membership Function. Constants of a and c in Low are 0.3 and 30; constants of a, b and c in Medium IS, 2, 50 constants of a and c in High -0.3 and 80 Low: f \( x I+exp\( a \( x - c Medium: f \(  x I + 1 \( x  - c 


High: f \( x I+exp\( -a \( x - c In experiments, we adjust the coefficient so that the signature attains more significance by making Information Gain value higher and Overlay Memory wider. However since not all signature statistics applies to the same Fuzzy Membership Function, many testing experiments are required to fine-tune each Membership Function to appropriate values and grade of individual Membership Function must be calculated in each signature. There are 12 signatures in one record and each signature have to calculate its grades in three different Membership Function. In other words, every record has 36 items, such as ill.low, ill.medium ill.high, . . .  , fll.low,fll.medium, fll.high,so it may mine numerous rules in 3 records gmde   Figure 3 Feature value Low, Medium, and High in Membership Function V. THE ANAL YSIS O F  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The setup of system parameters differs as its operating environment changes, because we need to take into account in experiments which period is more accurate. Namely, the morning detection rules is best used for network intrusion detection merely in the morning as sometimes great changes takes place in network traffic condition in different periods of a day. This experiment is based on two buildings of students' dormitory and performed in the night. Of the ISO collected DoS attacking software, 100 is used in experiments to search the above-mentioned 12 signatures \(higher Information Gain In order to test the detection results of this system, we have selected three types of attacking \(i.e. SYN Flood, Ping of Death and Smurf set 2seconds as an unit time and perform mining \(a judgment once every three unit time, so a unit in the horizontal axis of Figure.5 and Figure. 4 represents 6 seconds. During the experiment, Fuzzy Association Rules is produced by a long period accumulating of packets, averaging three records and incorporating them into algorithms of fuzzy association rules 


Through long-time collecting and averaging, normal conditions can be better reflected, but it have to take us more time to identitY whether these packets contain DoS attacks The bar graph value in Figure. 4 indicates the similar degree between fuzzy association rules and detection rules of real-time packet information. If the similar degree is lower than 0.1\(10 a the experimental results when the school uses DoS Smurf\(lGMPNUKE VI_O points, we perform normal network behavior, but at the later stage of the third time point, we start attacking procedures and keep attacking, from which it is found that the rules detected during following time points carry low similar degree with fuzzy association rules.

With every similar degree lower than 10%, it suggests that the twelve signatures selected by sorting Information Gain values and the selecting mode of coefficients in Membership Function can immediately detect DoslDDoS attacks in the design of our real-time network intrusion detection system Last, we emphasize that measurement of similar degree is greatly affected by network traffic. If network packet information changes frequently, then the measured value will fluctuate in a larger section. Besides, the similar degree is also influenced by density or duration of the attacking 1 _-------0.9 0.8 EfiI'IIlO.'0.' ________ _ 0.5 --------0.4 ------lto.3 ------0.2 --------o 3 4 5 6 "'" 14 'wum?unnnMD?u.g Figure 5.

THE CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH This paper mainly contributes to the design of a real-time network intrusion detection system based on Fuzzy Association Rules. Though we take only three units of time to detect information traffic, there are 36 actual items in each record and three records can detect out many rules since 12 signatures are adopted in each record and each signature value can be incorporated into three fuzzy Membership Functions. By comparing similar degree with experimental rules, if they are lower than 0.1\(10 them as attacking events. According to experimental results it is found that our system can make correct judgment and won't cause false positives towards massive FTP packets in a moment after appropriate adjustment of system parameters In the following few days, our work should focus on 


improving the efficiency of detecting procedures, including cutting unit time from the present two seconds to one second redefining the calculating mode of similar degree; adjusting the coefficients of fuzzy function by Genetic Algorithm attempting to detect based on Incremental transaction database instead of three transaction records. In the detection of incremental transaction database, we expect only one more accurate detection is performed in each unit time because both the present and the past information of the record will be detected REFERENCES I] German Florez, Susan M.Bridges , and Rayford B.

ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE COMPARISON All the experiments are performed on a AMD Athlon 64*2 Dual core processor 3800+ PC machine with 1G main memory, running on Microsoft Windows XP. All the programs are written in Microsoft Visual C++6.0 Experimental data is generated randomly by programming. And the number of items is 39 Experiment result shows that the efficiency of the counting algorithm is higher in comparison with Apriori algorithm and FP-tree algorithm. It is as shown in Figure 1               Figure 1.  Relationship of the support threshold with time consumption V. CONCLUSION The core of association mining is mining frequent itemset. Directly searching for maximal frequent itemset can increase efficiency of association mining algorithm This paper presents a new mining algorithm looking for Maximal Frequent Itemset. The algorithm with simply counting the value of rows and columns on associated matrix can find out the maximal frequent itemset and greatly simplifies the complexity of association mining algorithm. Analysis and experiments show that this algorithm has obvious advantages ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
