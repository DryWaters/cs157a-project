Firstly, the sample data set about assessment indexes of describing fire situation; Secondly, we find out useful information about possible future fire w ith association rule data mining  2 Forecasting fires with association rule data mining In this section, we use association rule data mining technology to analysis th e relationship rules between assessment indexes based history data. Then useful information to forecasting future fires will be found, such as fires grade, fires place, and so on 2.1 Definitions of association rule data mining with fire assessment indexes Association rule was or iginally proposed by Agrawal and Srikant in 1993. Then in the literatures [9  ciation rule again. T h e aim  of association rule is to find out the contact with different commodity \(set\he trade da ta base, that is, to look for the interesting contact in th e appointed data collection Through the description of th e potential relation rules between data sets in the data base, we can discover the dependence relations between many domains which are satisfied with the given threshold value of support and confidence. For discussing problems conveniently, we give several definitions of association rule with fire situation  Definition 1 Let D  D  t 1  t 2 205 t k 205 t n be association rule mini ng data collection t k   i 1  i 2 205 i i 205 i p  k 1,2,\205 n  t k stands up an affair and the element in t k is called by an Item which is the description of the fire situation Definition 2 We assume  that  I  i 1  i 2 205 i m is composed of all items in D Any subset X of I is called itemset X is called Xitemset if there is X  k  Association rule is the im plication formula such as X Y  where X I  Y I also X Y   X is the forward item and Y is the back item; Associati on rule can reflect the rule when the item of X appears, the item of Y must be. In fire problems, the interesting asso ciation rule can provide the reliable data for future fires prevention and fighting Definition 3. The number of affairs including item X  in D  is modeled as the support number of item X namely x The support rate of item X is figured as support  X  100 sup j x D Xport   1 where D denotes the affair number of D If support  X not smaller than the appointed smallest support, called min-support, we can reckon X as a big item, conversely a small ite m. The support rate of X Y is the support rate of association rule X Y namely support  X Y  support  X Y And we denote the confidence of association rule X Y by confidence  X Y  100 sup sup   Xport YXport YX confidence 2 The smallest confidence which is designated by the user could be figured as min-confidence  2.2 Process of mining association rules The process of mining association rules is categorized into the followings: \(1\nding out all of big items; \(2\g into being association rules through big items 1\nding out all of big items: According to definitions, the frequency that these big items appear is at least as same as the appo inted smallest support number Firstly, we establish the sample data set D of fire data over years  in Tab.1  Tab.1 Fires sample data set D  TID t 1 t 2 t k  t n  P 1  V 11  V 12  V 1 k  V 1 n P 2  V 21 V 22  V 2 k  V 2 n      P i V i 1 V i 2  V ik V in      P m V m 1  V m 2  V mk  V nn  Where P i is the place of fire and t k  k n the item of D In this paper, we assume that t k is an assessment index. Because there are plenty of assessment indexes we choose the fire survey, large fires, major fires, fire reasons, police action, battle results as t 1  t 2  t 3  t 4 The fire survey t 1 ncludes three items as following, fire number i 1 ber i 2 njured number i 3  property loss i 4 choose fire number i 5  i 6 s only item for large fires and major fires; there are human factors i 7 ctrical i 8 production operations i 9  the fire carelessly i 10 oking i 11 playing with fires  i 12 ontaneous combustion i 13 lightning strike i 14  static electricity i 15 gue reasons i 16 hers i 17  t 2  there are inputs to the human resources i 18 nd inputs to vehicles i 19 n t 3 there are the number of saving i 20  the number of evacuation i 21 d saving property i 22  in t 4 In this paper, we use Apriori algorithm to mine the Boolean association rules so that the value of quantitative attribute should be transformed to Boolean values.

It is confidence is above 84%. We can use the association rule to retrieval the sample data set D to find out the place data which conforms to the range of j3, a3, s4, t4. We need to take measures to strength the management of making use of fire by human being  Tab.1 Type size and typeface for papers Appearance Type Size pts Times New Roman Time s New Roman Bold 9 Figures, tables Figure captions, table names 10 Main text, equations references Subheadings 12 Authors\222 names Section titles 14 Paper title  3 Results analysis  Test the performances of the different min-support and min-confidence, we comp are that the relationship between different min-support with the amount of big items in Fig.1, and the relationship between different min-confidence with the ratio of interesting rules in Fig.2 where the ratio is given by the following equation \(4  n m ratio 4 where m is the number of interesting rules, and n is the number of all rules In fig.1, we can find that, with the continuous improvement of the min-support numerical, the amount of big items is decreasing. This is because that fire is 


 421  relative small probability event than other events. We do not allow that same fire event usually takes place under similar situations. So, the trend of the circle is consistent with the fact. It is important how to set up a moderate min-support. Not only there are enough data to mine the interesting rules, but it doesn\222t take too much time to scan the data base. In Fig.2, we can find that, with the continuous improvement of the min-confidence numerical, the ratio of the interesting rules to all rules is increasing.  However, when min-confidence is about 67%, the ratio of interesting rules is nearly equal to the other with higher min-confid ence. We can explain that the rules are useless if min-conf idence is low. Even if we get quite a lot of association rules, they are meaningless to analysis fires situation  0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 50 100 150 200  Amount of big items Min-support   Fig.1 the relationship between different min-support with the number of big items               Fig.2 the relationship betw een different min-confidence with the ratio of interesting rules  We use the data of fires about some city in 2000-2009. With the presented method, min-support is 54% and min-confidence is 67%, we can find out many interesting rules to forecas t the probability where, how many and why fire take place. The results conform to the data facts of 2010. Therefore, we can prove the feasibility and validity of the given algorithm to forecast the future situation and fire prediction and suppression  4 Conclusion  In this paper, a new approach with association rule data mining to forecast fires is presented. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm could be used to achieve the optimal solution. However, confidence and support will affect the result of forecasting fires Future work should examine more appropriate confidence and support. Furthermore, we use the traditional Apriori algorithm to find out interesting rules we should find out a new method to improve the mining speed. In addition, we will expand our algorithm to apply it to all kinds of environment, such as forest fires, which need to reset up an affair data base and compute the value of min-support and min-confidence.

1349  Haiti  Chile   Fig.2 The graph of maximum cliques of 4-item credible set  3 Data analysis  3.1 Analysis of 2-item credible set Based on the order of cred ibility, we can find from the statistics of the research all the obtained results of 2-item credible set are di fferent in the critical incidents of earthquake disasters in different areas, however, they have some kind of tendency some critical incidents with high credibility in co mmon, such as price inflation supplies scarcity, land traffic jams, shortage of water and power supply and plague epidemic etc. In some special areas there are other incidents that need to be carefully paying attention to such as radioactive pollution. This paper will use the2-item credible set which are high ranking in the order of th e credibility and happen in different areas but still have the universality to analysis and will illustrate in detail of special cases in special places 1\Inflation Supplies Scarcity  It is suggested that demand is a decreasing function ofprice by general microeconomic theory, however demand may become an increasing function of price, due to the prospects of imbalance between supply and demand, and panic of victims after disasters  This theory fully explains the credible association relationship between the two critical incidents, which are price inflation and supplies scarcity respectively. After the unexpected earthquake, it ma y stimulate the public's demand of basic living materials, which grows rapidly in a very short time, for people tend to exaggerate the consequences of the disaster psychologically. Meanwhile the earthquake may affect the production capacity of the relevant materials in disaster-affected regions, which could lead to strategic behavior, such as hoarding, by material supply enterprises and logistics service enterprises. What is more, it will also affect the service ability and costs of transport and logistics network dynamically and uncertainly  which was listed in Table 2, including land traffic jams, waterway congestion and aviation cong estion. These effects will lead to an imbalance of supply and de mand of living materials Simultaneously, the price formation mechanism after the earthquake, should consider the process of interaction behavior among consumers, businesses and government in the seismic environment. To some extent, the price formation process after disaster is decided mainly by the game between the stakeholders but not by the balance of supply and demand. The influencing factors include not only consumer's demand for goods, from basic needs to  disaster requirements, even to panic demand, but also factors in the enterprise leve l, like horizontal competition mechanism and supply chain transmission factors. In addition, government plays a decisive role in price formation process, with price intervention policies, the degree of commodity reservation and the suit able guide 2\Shortage of water and power supply  Plague epidemic Earthquakes will always cause ground cracking which is likely to cause bod y or tube joint damage of water pipes, and result in lacking of water pressure or losing water supply capacity Meanwhile, it might also cause power plants, substations or transmission lines do  Land traffic jams Social chaos  Supplies scarcity  Price inflation Political chaos  Social chaos  Supplies scarcity Price inflation 


1350  not work in particular regions. Power systems as well as water supply systems are im portant components of the lifeline systems, which are directly related to the normal operation of social production and all aspects of life Moreover, in emergency rescue after earthquake, as an important energy supply, power system is not only the source of motive power for lifeline project like communication, but also the ma in guarantee to transport materials and rescue the wounded. Meanwhile, the normal running of water supply system determines the condition of victims' liv ing water and public health situation directly. During 48 h ours after the disaster, the meaning of pure water for the survivors is more important than food, unless enough clean water is supplied by the rescuers quickly, otherwise, survivors may be infected with any diseases one can imagine. In Haiti, the most common diseases of the victims are respiratory disorders caused by heavy smoke and dust inhalation and diarrhea caused by drinking polluted water, which lead to increasi ng risk of suffering from dengue fever, malaria and urticaria. Once the earthquake or epidemic plague occurs, it might not be limited to a certain part, but spread rapidly affecting the entire region threatening the entire country and even other countries Large-scale public health epidemic that has the characters of spreading rapidly, continuity and chain properties, which often make a regional disaster, quickly escalated into a national or even global crisis. And with the development of information age, the link between things become diversification and synchronic, and limited resources can also lead to attend one thing and lose another, forming a "cascade effect", which will increase the impact of the crisis  Therefore, the spread of crisis will be more visible and prominent in globalization and information age. Thus, the stagnation of water and power supply systems, is likely to cause infectious disease outbreaks in a very short time after natural disasters  Therefore, it is impossible to ignore the credible association relati onship between shortage of water and power supply and plague epidemic, and the mining results of this study indeed confirm the relationship between the two critical incidents  3\ Shortage of water and power supply Communications blackout The anti-earthquake ability of a communication system will affect the rescue after the disaster directly without considering the breakdown of the signal propagation which attributes to th e power supply which was destroyed in the earthquake, when the communication equipment such as the signal tower is destroyed, the whole system will crash as well. It probably leads to the situ ation that the information of disaster rescue operation cannot reported to the headquarter in time, the rescue command cannot arrive and the effective rescue cannot be taken place within a short time after the earthqua ke, these will result in the situation expanding to an uncontrollable state  For example, after the earthquake in Wenchuan, China, the communication between the distress area and the outside was cut off as long as 20 hours, it highly increased the difficulty of rescuing. The blackout of communication can be mainly represented as telephone line cutoff or internet cutoff. Based on th e mining results, the situation happened more obviously in the Japan and Taiwan earthquakes than any others, for most of the voice and internet data are transmitted th rough the fiber-optic cable in the ocean, which would be easily destroyed in the earthquakes in the islands areas such as Japan and Taiwan. According to this po int, a higher credibility of the relationship between communication blackout and shortage of water and power supply was concluded. Thus this result indicates the ef fectiveness of CAR and its maximum clique mining algorithm again to a certain degree 4 ioactive pollution In the mining result of 2item credible set of this empirical research, there is a couple of incidents need to be paid high attention, which is the relationship between radioactive pollution and supplies scarcity, the two critical incidents of the ear thquake in March 2011,Japan Due to the earthquake, Fukusgima nuclear power plant got a large-scale nuclear leakage accident, which led to a huge damage to the environm ent, not only polluting the air with radioactive substance s and atomic dusts, but also it caused secondary pollution for the residents in Japan The accident intensified the worry from all the parties about the Japanese food, which is influenced by the nuclear pollution seriously, and unfortunately, it tended to be diffusion. By March 26t h 2011, it had already been 99 kinds of products suffered from nuclear contamination in Tokyo and five other areas 18 In Japan lots of individuals panic bou ght agricultural products and necessaries for living, as a result, the phenomenon of supplies scarcity appeared gradually. Meanwhile, Japan is one of the world's biggest food import state, its domestic resources are limited, what was worse, these limited products would decrease rapidly attributing to the nuclear pollution. Therefore, the import demand of agricultural products would expand to a higher level, it is likely to stimulate the increasing of agricultural products imports in some Asian economies, and then it is entirely possible to push some worldwide food prices to a higher level. Although the effect may be not appear very soon, it indeed confirm the cred ible association relationship between radioactive pollu tion and supplies scarcity  3.2 analysis of 3-item credi ble set and 4-item credible set To observe the results of the maximum cliques shown in Figure 1 and 2, any two vertices, namely any credible association credibility between two critical incidents is greater than 0.2, which means that in many critical incidents of earthquake disasters of the special areas, several events shown in the figure are most likely to occur simultaneously. In the analysis of the 2-item credible set, it has been illustrated the relationships between the incidents and the reasons for them such as supplies scarcity. Therefore, this paragraph would pay 


1351  more attention to explain the credible association relationships between the political chaos, social chaos and other critical incidents in special areas Due to the earthquake, lacking of supplies, the rising prices and other series of crises become inevitable incidents to victims, and it indirectly lead to social disorder and unrest. Wang Hanzhong analyzed the process that the ancient Chinese farmers became the bandits because of their hungry or displaced when disaster came 19 When the farmers did nothing to the disaster, the ending of them was sitting and waiting for death. However, when the farmers became desperate to be the bandits, they might survive from the disaster Although it is rarely to see that victims becoming bandits after disasters in modern society on a global scale, the emergence of critical incident s might inhibit the implementation of the policy to a certain extent, which would affect the peoples normal production and living order. When a disaster occurs in a country with a unstable political situation, this social disruption would occur, and even eventually lead to violent incidents According to the years of colonial domination and slavery system, there are 3 main political forces in Haiti areas, and due to historical grievances, they have never got a political consensus Therefore, no matter who take office, it is hard to obtain universal supported, and it is difficult to produce a strong internal cohesion in the state  Facing to a disaster, the government is hard to obtain peoples trust, and people barely can be taken care of the government either. Du ring the period after the disaster, society was disorder ed and looting happened everywhere, besides, limited social relief organizations always seemed too weak to solve the problem. It is difficult to implement national political wills effectively and also difficult to obtain positive responses from other social organizations. After th e earthquake, not only the victims were difficult to obtain drinking water, food basic shelter and social security but also the social contempt for the dead demonstrated a kind of disrespect for life, which caused large-scale post-earthquake humanitarian crisis in Haiti, and violence events occurred frequently. Thus, as the results shows above there are strong credible association among the critical incidents, supplies scarcity price inflation, land traffic jams, social chaos and political chaos  4 Enlightenment of the paper  In recent decades, due to the frequent occurring of the earthquake, different governments all over the world positively formulated diverse emergency response plans for destructive earthquake according to their national conditions. They published relevant policies and took measures to try to decrease the damage of the earthquake into a small range. Considering the analysis above results of data mining based on CAR and its maximum clique mining algorithm inde ed reflect the relationships between different critical incidents of earthquake disaster so it is entirely possible to propose more effective emergency response plans based on this research, that means to observe these relationships of the incidents systematically. The government should fully consider the cascade effect of the critical incidents of earthquake disasters, through the occurring of one incident, they could forecast which one is the most likely to happen next. It would help to avoid suggesting single solution to only one critical incident and overmuch paying attention on lower possible ones, in other words, it is entirely possible to try to suggest more effective and comprehensive emergency response plans. As a result not only can it help to rescue smoothly, but also it is significant to stabilize the society and decrease the negative impacts   5 Conclusion  This paper introduces credible association rule and its maximum clique mining algorithm, combined with the composition of the evolution of risk events, this paper analyzes the data of 9 earthquakes which bring greater impact to the world than any others in recent 4 years as an empirical research. According to related theories and discussions, this paper verifies the exactness of the mining results and the effectiveness of the CAR and its maximum clique mining algorithm under the situation of earthquake. Th e results of data mining represent the credible associati on relationships of the critical incidents of the earthquake disasters, after the global observation, the paper analyzes couples of critical incidents which have the universal properties and higher potential occurring probabilities, and it is significant to conduct the governments in different areas for proposing the emergency response plan scenario for destructive earthquake. However, there is a defect in this paper as well, namely lacking of the research on the incidents which credibility is lower than the threshold, while, they would be analyzed in the future study to avoid omitting o ther constructive significant information  References  1 n g wenxi Response to emergencies and public crisis management.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
