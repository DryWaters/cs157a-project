I I NTRODUCTION Spatial Data Mining \(SDM\, an important branch of Data Mining, refers to extraction of implicit knowledge, spatial relationships, and other patterns which are not explicitly stored in Spatial Database. Geographic Information System \(GIS system based on Geospatial Dat abase for geographic decision support. Introducing the concept pattern and method of DM and KDD into the field of GIS, we can use the storage management and analysis function of GIS to make the limited data in GIS become the limitl ess knowledge. For doing so, we can effectively handle the huge data, advance the autoimmunization and intelligence level of the geography data analysis and offer powerful analys is tools for the globe change and sustainable development II S PATIAL D ATA M INING A The definition of s

The knowledge found from GIS has 
two main aspects of application 1 Applying spatial data mining to GIS can find knowledge the users need from GIS spatia l database automatic or semiautomatic, directly provide use to decision makers or guide further treatment, make it a GIS intelligent analytical tool and an important tool which constitutes GIS expert system and decision support system 2\ote sensing imagery interpretation Finding knowledge from GIS dat abase through the spatial data mining technology can be used for solving prachanda foreign and doppl er synonyms problem s by restriction auxiliary, guiding in remote sensing imagery interpretation reduce the doubt degrees in classification of recognition improve the reliability, precision an d speed of interpretation The spatial data mining is an im portant technology and a tool to establish a knowledge acquis ition of remote sensing imagery

spatial data sample, it is hard to summarize general steps and methods, the experimental results of the same methods in different application environm ent often differ greatly Therefore, aiming at  different spatial data mining algorithm setting up different mathematical model, making each kind of spatial data mining methods has corresponding dat a processing model is an effective way to redu ce manual intervention degree of data processing and enhance model generality. Putting forward this model is mainly to provide a generic framework for finding knowledge from GIS It is only made a generally elaboration for the work style of various unit in the model, and the specific details of the work need further research IV S PATIAL ASSOCIATION RULES MINING METHOD BASED ON GIS Finding spatial association rules from spatial database is the key of research on the spa tial data mining technology According to the spatial data mining model based on GIS and combining with association rules mining algorithm, it is proposed a spatial association rul es mining method based on concept lattice, its principle is to introduce concept lattice in spatial data mining technology, to combine GIS spatial analysis and data storage function with the association rules mining algorithm of concept lattice effectively, to find association relationship between the special entities in mu ltiple layers from GIS database The key to this method is to transform the spatial relations between spatial objects into form background, to tectonic spatial object connect watch, and then to extract association rules using concept lattice methods It is mainly involved two parts of the job: the work of GIS and the work of concept lattice 1\ The work of GIS: the main work of GIS is to use its powerful spatial analysis functions to find out the spatial relationships between the multip le layers of spatial entities such as intersection, approach, co ntains etc. Using the found spatial relation, obtaining the predicate said between spatial entities, finally realizing perform ance between multiple layers of spatial entities in the same rules 2\work of concept lattice: c oncept lattice is a kind of effective method of extracting association rules, but the existing spatial association rule s mining method generally uses the classical Apriori algorithm to extract association rules. The efficiency of concept lattice is higher compared to Apriori therefore the work of concep t lattice is to extract association rules, to reduce the time complexit y of spatial mining algorithm The specific process of this met hod is divided into four steps, respectively for preparation of spatial data background creating connections tables, concept lattice construction and spatial association rules mining. Th rough the above four steps we can realize spatial associati on rules mining from the GIS combining spatial data mining algorithm model based on GIS and give the algorithm flow chart as follows  Figure 2 spatial association rules mining process V S PATIAL ASSOCIATION RULES MINING EXPERIMENT On the basis of spatial association rules mining method according to the spatial association rules mining steps, using the spatial analysis and data management functions of MAPGIS, makes experimental valid ation to spatial association rules mining method. The data used in the experiment comes from a provincial agricultural transaction database; this database contains agricultural trading market, types of agricultural products, volume, ori gin, price and other related agricultural products data. In a ddition, we still use the data from the provincial geographic information system for transportation, including transp ortation roads related data of province highway, railway, and river 1\ia l query functions, retrieving and extracting relevant data co llections from agricultural transaction database and geographi c information system for transportation as follows: \(1 ing market, including attribute data {market name agricultural products name transaction price etc}. \(2\Road, including attributes {road name, length, starting and te rminal point etc}, there is a conceptual hierarchical relationship in road; its concept 3\r, including attribute data {river name, length, etc}. Meanwhile, it gives spatial relation concept hierarchy \(figure 4 experts or specific users given, such as table 1\ along with road concept hierarchical relati onships to build expert knowledge Figure 3 road concept hierarchy charts

First, extracting market name of the trading market and the price fields from relation database, statistic price data histogram, using histogram equalization method to make price data discretized, using high", "medium" and "low three qualitative valu e to describe agricultural product price attr ibute, import the generalized attribute price data into the relat ion database. Then, supposed that this experiment demand s to find the association rules between the second concepts of the road, making the corresponding data generalized according to road concept hierarchical relationship, getting the generalized spatial entities relation table. Finally, fusing the generalized price data and the spatial entities relation table, constitute a spatial predicate connection table \(TABLE III TABLE III SPATIAL PREDICATE CONNECTION Trading market spatial predicate national highway spatial predicate railway spatial predicate river Price Guangde Interesects 318 Interesects Yi Hangline  High Changfeng Close_to 206 Interesects Interesects HuaiNanline  Low Lingbi  adjacent_to Tuo River Medium Guzhen Interesects 206 Interesects JingLuline  Medium Suzhou Interesects 206 Interesects HuaiNanline adjacent_to Tuo River High Xiaoxian Interesects 311 Interesects Close_to FuJia-line LongHailine  High

So from this information, the dyer can control the temperature to produce the best PH result, with normal in condition. Hence, this low frequent behavior occurs only when the input parameter is set with the lower bound of the support to 0.5 instead of 0.1 as kept in the illustration 1 Therefore, the low frequent behavior can be generated for any cluster of dyeing process log, easily using LRM algorithm with various parameter settings V C ONCLUSION This article discussed that, how clustering can be achieved using the LRM algorithm. Two experiments were used for this illustration. They showed that how clustering can be performed on the basis of association rules and frequent itemsets respectively. The first illustration show that the obtained clusters can be used for further mining and the mined process models can be simple and easy to understand. Clusters can also represent frequent patterns existing in the log when the support count of items is chosen as the basis of clustering The second experiment was conducted using the same log from dyeing process log of Jayabala dyeing, with lower bound minimum support 0.5. This illustration identifies the low frequent behavior and cluster the dataset to discover the low frequent pattern Clustering, can therefore, be utilized to obtain specific process models or to generate simpler models, as opposed to the spaghetti-like models. Further, the clustering functionality in LRM could also be enhanced, to obtain a hierarchy of logs based on the association rules. The cluster from an association rule can be further mined with the LRM again, and one of the generated rules can be used for further clustering. Repeating this sequence of generating association rules and clustering can give the user a tree of logs satisfying different variants of the same association rule \(that is initially used for clustering The leaf nodes then would be the logs representing the most basic associations \(may be in form of a rule: a=>b, instead of a=>b, c R EFERENCES   D a vid C h e ung Vinc e n t T   Ad a W  Fu a nd Y ongji a n F v  E f f ic i e nt  Mining of Association Rules in Distributed Databases, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering ,Vol 8 , No 6, Dec 1996   Wit t e n I H  a nd Fra nk E   D a t a  M i ning: P r a c tica l Mac hine  Lea rning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations, Morgan Kaufmann San Francisco, 1999   G r a i g Silve rst e in  S e rg e y  B r in a nd Ra j e e v M ontwa ni, B ey ond M a rke t Baskets: Generalizing Association Rules to Dependence Rules, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Vol. 2, No. 1, Jan 1998, Kluwer Academic Publishers   Ge di mi n a s Ado ma vi c iu a nd Ale x a nd e r  Tuz hilin E xpe rt drive n validation of Rule-Baed Models in Personalization Data Mining and Knowledge - Discovery Vol 5, No 1 / 2 Kluwer Academic Publishers April 2001   H u a n L i u  F a r h a d H ussa i n  C h e w  L i m Ta n a nd Ma nora nja n Da sh  Discretization: An Enabling Technique", Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, vol. 6 No. 4, Kluwer Academic Publishers, October 2002   Jia w e i H a n  L a ks V S  La ksh m a n a n a n d  R a ym ond T.N G   C onstra intBased  Multidimensional Data Mining, IEEE Computer, August 1999   K e Wa ng  S o on Hoc k W i l liam T a y   a nd B i ng L i u Inte re stingne ssBased Interval Merger for Numeric Association Rules, Fourth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery& Data Mining, New York,USA 1998    K r z y s z t o f J C i os, Pe d r ye z a nd R o m a n W   S u r n i a rski  D a t a  M i ning Methods for Knowledge Discovery, Kluwer Academic Publishers 1998 Second Printing 2000   M i ng-Sy a n  c h e n Jia we i H a n  a nd Phil ip S  Yu  D ata  M i ning: A n  Overview From a Database Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol. 8, No. 6, Dec. 1996   Ra k e sh A  grawa l  P a r al l e l M i ni ng o f As soc i a tions R u l e    I E EE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering ,Vol 8 , No 6, Dec 1996   Ra makrishna n Srika nt  a nd R a k e s h A.

the largest Qi. This sub-matrix is composed of the corresponding rows with the 1 on the columns of Qi Then, continuing division from remaining sub-matrix Similarly, in the left sub-matrix, all Qi is calculated according to the largest Qi, until all the rows and columns are covered 1420 3 If there exists across the rows on a division, the columns of these rows with 1 form a new sub-matrix If there is more than the largest Qi, the Qi selected is one of Qi from top to bottom. The method is selecting the rows that at least one of their columns includes ones in the row of the largest Qi When divided into sub-matrixes, it is important that the union set of rows and columns in all sub-matrixes shall include rows and columns in the original matrix Note: the itemset of sub-matrixes after intersection operation must be empty. Otherwise, the intersection of the rows is divided into a new sub-matrix The following is an example of division of matrix. The initial matrix is as shown in table 2. Three sub-matrixes after the division are as shown in table 3, 4 and 5. Table 5 is the new sub-matrix composed by the intersection of the rows TABLE II.

        Step 6: Using elimination method in step 3 to the submatrixes and Qi queue  by decreasing order until no new sub-matrix can be divided out Step 7: Selecting the combination of rows in the submatrixes According to the minimum support threshold and rows and columns selected in advance in step 3, the number of row which Qi is more than minimum support threshold will be selected out. Selected rows will be combined. The number of possible combinations is r nC : n is the number of rows selected; r is the minimum support threshold Because there are rows or columns selected in advance in step 3, it is necessary to take into account this factor There are four cases discussed The case 1: there is no selected rows and columns in advance Because no selected rows and columns in advance, this case can be dealt with according to normal conditions The case 2: there is rows selected in advance Because there are the rows selected in advance, the number of rows to be selected can be reduced. The number of possible combinations is r t n tC  t is the number of rows selected in advance. In this way, computation can be reduced to improve the algorithm efficiency The case 3: there is columns selected in advance Because there are the columns selected in advance these columns become the part of the maximal frequent itemset. These columns do not change the method. In the 


end, these columns are only added to maximal frequent itemset selected The case 4: there are selected rows and columns in advance The case 4 is the combination of the case 2 and the case 3 According to the case 2, we can use the way to reduce the number of rows. By the case 3, we can use the way to add the columns selected in advance to the maximal frequent itemset, together with the composition of maximal frequent itemset Step 8: Searching for maximal frequent itemset. In accordance with the selected combination of rows, all of one-itemset supports Pi are computed out. The maximal frequent itemset is composed of itemset which the oneitemset supports Pi equals to minimum support threshold The number of the items in the itemset is the maximal frequent itemset length I4 I5 I6 1 1 1 3 1 1  2 1 1 2 2 2 I3 I6 1  1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1421 4 B.an example To explain the use of the above algorithm, the following will illustrate an example Transaction database D is as shown in table 6.

Here are items for the I4 column and transaction for T800 row to be eliminated. The I4 column is eliminated by the first condition. The T800 row is eliminated by the forth condition.
