itemsets can only capture the long-term and static frequency itemsets, they do not suit the task whose frequent itemsets often change. Using the theory of ant colony algorithm, we proposed a new method for mining dynamical frequent itemset\(called AC-MFI\ The method consid ers the item of transaction as a node in the path, takes the itemset as a path and takes each transaction as a foraging behavior. According to the pheromone updating policy of ant colony algorithm, ACMFI mines dynamical frequent itemsets from transaction data stream. Experiment results show that the method is valid and practicable Keywords- dynamical frequent itemsets; ant colony algorithm data mining; association rules I I NTRODUCTION Mining frequent itemsets is the core problem of mining association rules, it determines the performance of association rules directly [1   Wi th t h e de ve lopin g a n d mo r e  detailed of the research on frequent itemsets mining, it is widely used in the field of data mining, for example, mining association rule, correlation analysis, classification, and clustering et al.[2  U p t o  n o w   t h e re are t w o k i n d s o f mi n i n g

The DFS algorithms use the pattern growth strategy to avoid generating a large number of candidate sets, the typically algorithms are FPGrowth algorithm, CLOSET algorithm and OpportuneProject algorithm [4   Ea c h mi n i n g m e thod above has its own advantages in practical applications, and has achieved good performance. However, it also has some shortcomings: it can only capture the long-term and static frequency itemsets, and this can not properly reflect the dynamically change of frequent itemsets [5  B u t w e a l l  know: just as human's interesting always change, frequent itemsets will also change in a long period of time Based on ant colony algorithm, we count itemsets according to the pheromone concentration. Moreover, using 
the accumulating and volatilization characteristic of pheromones, we simulate the change of frequency of itemsets, and propose a new mining method for dynamical frequent itemsets The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduce the theory of Ant Colony Algorithm, section 3 describe the method for mining dynamical frequent itemsets in detail, section 4 discuss experiments and itês analysis, and section 5 concludes the paper II A NT C OLONY A LGORITHM Ant Colony Algorithm was presented by the Dr. Marco Dorigo, who was inspired from the foraging behaviors of real ants in the natural world. He found that ants can find the shortest path from the food source to the nest without vision In the feeding process, ants can release pheromone which is proportional to the quality of food source, perceive the presence of pheromones, and tend to follow the paths where pheromone concentration is higher. Thus, the collective behavior of ant colony show a positive feedback phenomenon: when a path have more ants went through, the 
later ants are more likely to follow that path. Therefore, the best and nearest food source would attract more and more ants, and the growth rate of pheromone concentration is faster then otherês [6   A n t colo n y a l g o rit h m wo r k s as f o ll ow   Figure 1 The theory of Ant Colony Algorithm based on pheromone concentration: \(a\nitial state of two paths ; \(b\he pheromone concentration of two path after some time Suppose there are two paths called the ACB and ADB between point A and point B, and the length of ACB is longer than ADB's. Ants move back and forth between point A and point B. Assuming that there is same number of ants on the two paths at the beginning, because ADB is shorter then ACB, ants which in ADB move more times, and deposit more pheromone. Then, because of the positive feedback ___________________________________ 978-1-4244-8728-8 1 1 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE  


mechanism of ant colony algorithm, there will be more ants follow the path ADB, and thus the pheromone density will be higher, until ants find the nearest path Ant colony algorithm has the virtues of simpleness robustness and parallel in essence. As a new type of general heuristics method, it have been successfully applied to solve the TSP problem, allocation, VRP, job-shop scheduling, and other NP-C problem[7   III T HE METHOD FOR MINING DYNAMICAL FREQUENT ITEMSETS BASED ON ANT COLONY ALGORITHM The item of transaction can be considered as a node in the path, the itemset may be regarded as a path, and the transaction may be regarded as a foraging behavior According to the pheromone updating policy of ant colony algorithm, the pheromone density of frequent itemset is higher then that of non-frequent itemset. Using ant colony algorithm, we can get the value of the evaluation function of all paths, and identify frequent itemsets quickly and accurately. Because the pheromone is real-time updated, the frequent itemsets we obtained has dynamic characteristics A The parameters of ant colony algorithm Ant colony algorithm works according to the evaluation function by which ants select foraging path.  According to the character of frequent itemsets, we calculate the evaluation function with support degree and pheromone concentration, it is defined as follows           n k k k l l l t t t p 1                1 where n is the total number of paths     0,1 ar e t h e  regulatory factor for pheromone concentration and support degree respectively P l  t is the evaluation function which represents the probability of path l being selected by the next ant, and the path l is corresponding to the current itemset In the equation \(1  k is support degree  k  t s pheromone concentration. The support degree is calculated by the times of items co-occurrence in transaction data stream. Assuming that N i N j are the two node which is corresponding to two items l  i j is the path which from node N i to node N j the times of ants go through the path l  i j is denoted by C  i j the support degree is defined as   i j     1 1       n k k i C j i C 2 where n is the total number of paths   i j is support degree of the path l  i j  Pheromone concentration represents the frequency of items occurrence in transaction data stream, it is lower as time goes on, and is higher as the items occurrence in transactions. The pheromone concentration at time t is described as follows  l  t 1     l  t     l   3 In the equation \(3  l  t is the pheromone concentration at time t   is the coefficient of pheromone evaporation  is the constant related to pheromone concentration, and the   l is the added value of the pheromone concentration of path l    l is defined as   l    1   1     t t m k k l  4 where  1     t t k l  is the value of pheromone that the kth ant deposits on the path l during the period from time t to time t+1  Given the threshold of the evaluation function, we can calculate the value of the evaluation function P l  t f all paths by the equation \(1\, and get frequent itemsets dynamically B The algorithm of mining dynamical frequent itemsets Considering item, itemset and transaction as a node, a path and a foraging process respectively, we can get the value of the evaluation function P l t\f all paths according to the equation \(1\, and take the top-k paths as frequent itemsets quickly and dynamically. Using the structure of FPtree, the algorithm of mining dynamical frequent itemsets called AC-MFI\s described as follows Input: m preprocessed transactions, the threshold of evaluation function \(denoted by T p  Output: frequent itemsets \(stored in set F Step1  Tree=NULL t=0  l  t   l 0, C l 0 Step2  Get frequent 1-itemsets by scanning transactions sort it by support degree in, and save it in the list of frequent item \(denoted by L  Step3  FOR \(i=1 to m rank items of transaction i by the order of list L for each ordered item i of transaction, seek it in the Tree, if found, update C l   l  t  otherwise, create a new sub-tree for remaining items, initialize it's parameters such as C l   l  t and link it to it's parent node ENDFOR Step4  Calculate support degree  l of all paths by the equation \(1 Step5  Initialize the regulatory factor     FOR each path l in Tree calculate evaluation function of path l denoted by P l  t  if P l t p then l  F ENDFOR Step6  Return F IV E XPERIMENTS AND R ESULTS A Validity experiments of obtained frequent itemsets We mined frequent itemsets from transaction data stream and determined the validity of obtained frequent itemsets by it's accuracy of predicting the subsequent transactions. [8  presented an algorithm of obtaining customizable behavior model by mining frequent pattern set \(CBMFP for short 


and predicted user's behavior by obtained customizable behavior model. In order to compare the validity of our mining algorithm with it's, we use the log file used in [8   The data are from three different types of servers: the first log is from the Computer Science Department of the Polytechnic University of Madrid \(abbreviation: CS\ the second log is from the NASA Kennedy Space Center server abbreviation: NASA\he third log is from a commercial website named ClarkNet \(abbreviation: ClarkNet\. The characteristics of training logs and test logs are given as follow TABLE I T RAINING  LOGS C HARACTERISTICS Date Size of sessions CS Sep. 2001 27M 3,499 NASA Jul. 1995 160M 124,666 ClarkNet 6-9 Sep. 1995 102.8M 72,312 TABLE II T EST  LOGS C HARACTERISTICS Date Size of sessions CS Oct. 1 st 2001 170K 53 NASA Aug. 1 st 1995 6.8M 2753 ClarkNet Sep. 10 th 1995 19M 5725 Using the mining algorithm of this paper \(named ACMFI\, we obtained the frequent itemsets from training data and predicted subsequent transactions by the frequent itemsets, and compared the accuracy with [7 The  r e sul ts are  as follows TABLE III P REDICTION A CCURACY C OMPARISON ON FREQUENT ITEMSETS Algorithm  CS NASA ClarkNet CBMFP 62 16 17 AC-MFI 75.8 28.1 19.3 It is clear that the AC-MFI can work better from the analysis on table III. Because of using dynamic mining method, AC-MFI obtained better frequent itemsets which can reflect the current characteristics of the data, and got better prediction B Experiments dynamic performance of obtained frequent itemsets The best virtue of AC-MFI is that it can dynamically mine frequent itemsets which reflect the current characteristics of the data. To verify this derectly, we generated a set of data whose frequent itemsets were changed, then made simulation test with AC-MFI, and observed the changes of frequent itemsets. The training data is showed as follows TABLE IV T HE LIST OF TRANSACTION DATA TID List of item_IDs T001 I1, I2, I5 T002 I1, I2, I3, I4, I6 T003 I1, I2 T004 I1, I2, I7 T005 I1, I4, I5, I6, I7 T006 I3, I4, I9 T007 I3, I5, I7, I8 T008 I2, I3, I7, I10,I15 T009 I1, I3, I7, I11 Assuming that the minimum support count of transaction is 3, the traditional algorithm might get frequent itemset I1I2: 4}, {I3I7: 3}} by mining on this 9 transactions \(To express conveniencely, the itemset {I1, I2} is called itemset1 and the itemset {I3, I7} is called itemset2 \ However, if you analysis the data stream, you will find two facts: 1. For a long time, the frequent itemset is itemset1 \(it had occurred continuously 4 times\; 2. Recently, the frequent itemset has changed \(the itemset1 hasn't appeared in recent 5 transactions, but the itemset2 has occurred continuously 3 times To show the change process of frequent itemsets intuitionally, we increased the coefficient of pheromone evaporation while trained the transaction data described in table 3. The parameters of ant colony algorithm are defined as  0.15  1  0.5. The curves of evaluation function for each itemset are shown as below  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2   Training times The value of evaluation function Item set1  Item set2  Figure 2. The curves of evaluation function for each itemset 


From figure 2, we can see two facts: 1. At the beginning of the training, the value of evaluation function of itemset1 increased at exponential growth because of it's continuous occurrence, and the value of itemset2 is zero; 2. In the second half of training, the value of evaluation function of itemset1 decrease gradually because it hasn't appeared in later transactions, but the value of itemset2 increased gradually with it's occurrence. So, it can be concluded that the algorithm can capture dynamically the current frequent itemsets while the frequent itemsets got changed V C ONCLUSIONS Just as our habits and customs always change, frequent itemsets may also change constantly in many cases. How to mine dynamical frequent itemsets accurately and efficiently is a hard problem. Using the pheromone updating policy of ant colony algorithm, we presented a novel efficient method for mining dynamical frequent itemsets in this paper. The results of the experiment reveal that the method is valid and practicable A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research work is supported by National Natural Foundation of China under Grant NO.61005010 and Scientific Research Foundation for the Talents by Hefei University under Grant NO. 11RC06 R EFERENCES 1 Agrawal R and Srikant R, çFast Algorithms for Mining Association Rulesé, Proc of the International Conference on Very Large Databases.

Figure 4 A sequence of queries may differ for each issued query indeed we are supposing that the values of the dynamic data e.g the occupation of a classroom may be updated at each user request As the example highlights in the worst case the set V 026 r 033 contains a view for each query formulated by the user However in our case study we suppose that updates of the sensor tables are not continuous but triggered by a certain sampling policy e.g a sample every thirty minutes Moreover during the frequency computation it is not necessary to recompute from scratch all the views associated with the queries referring to Fig 4 we may compute the views associated with the instants t 1  t 4 and t 7  and derive the needed ones only by modifying the values of the sensor attributes that can be retrieved by querying the temporal relations Example 2 Score computation Consider the server log in Fig 3 The rule situation=alone  occupation=[0,50 is mined with con\002dence 3 4  with the contribution of the contexts C 1 021 situation=alone and C 2 021 situation=alone  interest topic=classrooms  The log rows related to C 1 are associated with two time instants t 1 and t 3  connected with different views According to the tables in Fig 2 the frequency of the value 0  50 in the view of C 1 at instant t 1 is 3/4 while at instant t 3 is 1/2 Suppose that the frequency in the view related to context C 2 at instant t 2 is 1/3 Applying 2 we obtain f 026 r 033  1 4 001 3 4  1 2 001 1 2  1 4 001 1 3  0  52  Finally choosing 015  2  we can compute the preference score by 1  2 001  3 4 000 0  52  0  46  The inferred preferences will be used to customize the contextual views and their computation requires a periodic aging step not described here 6 Conclusions and Future Work This paper has informally described a methodology exploiting data mining for the automatic extraction of contextual preferences on relational and sensor data The described techniques have been implemented in a Java tool so far managing only standard relational data We have evaluated the approach on a movie-related case study exploiting a real video-on-demand log 002le achieving encouraging results in terms of recall in more detail in our experimental setting our approach gains 8.3 recall w.r.t a naive algorithm based on item popularity reaching 38.8 against 30.5 We have also used our techniques to mine non-contextual preferences 002nding that in our case study context can bring 3.3 recall increase In the future we plan to add to our prototype the ability of managing sensor data too Moreover currently preference mining relies only on the user past querying activity we are now investigating the possibility to combine our proposal with other techniques coming from recommendation systems in

First, data generalization consisting of the movie clustering and the neighborhood aggregation was done. Next, after doing normalization on these data, we used the personal normalized data to mine association rules based on customer preferences, and stored them in the rule base. Finally, rule information aided a preliminary recommendation; afterward, the relevance feedback mechanism improved further recommendations based on the explicit interaction from customers A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by National Science Council of R.O.C under Grant NSC99-2220-E-224-005 R EFERENCES  1  Cane Wing-Ki Leung, Stephen Chi-fai Chan, and Fu-lai Chung  A collaborative filtering framework based on fuzzy association rules and multiple-level similarity   Knowledge and Information Systems, Vol. 10, No. 3, pp 357-381, 2006 2  S.

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm.

The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
