Research and Application of Small and Mediumsized Manufacturing Enterprises Sales Promotion Model Based on Data Mining  Wang Yong Business School, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology USST Shanghai, China wangyong816@163.com Wang Hengshan Business School, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology USST Shanghai, China wanghs@usst.edu.cn   Abstract How to make an appropriate sales promotion strategy is critical for enterprises, especially those small and mediumsized manufacturing enterprises. In this paper, we propose a customer-oriented model for sales promotion using data mining techniques. The proposed model can efficiently discovery the association rules between goods. To make the mining algorithm more scalable, a sparse data structure is designed and embedded into an improved association rule mining algorithm. We apply the proposed model on a cleaning product manufacturer Experimental results show its effectiveness Keywords-data mining; knowledge discovery in database association rules; Apriori algorithm I   I NTRODUCTION  Data mining is a new technology as a main step to discovery knowledge in database \(Knowledge discovery in database, KDD\hich is rising in the middle of 1990s  KDD consists of three parts: data preparation, data mining interpretation and evaluation of results. Date mining, as a tool to systematically examine and understand large amounts of date, can effectively help commercial enterprises to extract valuable information from incomplete, noisy, fuzzy, and random actual data. Therefore it could provide valid basis for enterprise to make scientific decision 2-4  Data mining techniques, including association rules 5  decision tree 6 clustering 7 and other technologies have been widely used and developed in the shopping basket analysis marketing and customer relationship management. In the business intelligence analysis, an important task is to understand the hidden relationships among products. Some researchers use association algorithm to analyze the relationship among commodities, which are based on customer purchase history 8 Sales Promotion refers to the behavior of sales propaganda The purpose is to encourage consumers to strengthen the enthusiasm of buying products, advertise a product or provide a service. With homogeneous products and channels further increasing, the position of sales promotion in marketing link is becoming more and more important 1 Making scientific decisions of sales promotion for enterprises is particularly critical. Making out distinctive promoting program can reduce marketing costs and lead to sales increasing Due to their size, capital, technology and other issues, some small and medium manufacturing enterprises do not pay much attention to the wishes of the customers from the quantitative view. They judge customers’ demands just by subjective and self-experience, and arrange the production and sales promotion. This is not only inadaptable to the competitive market economy, but also affecting customers’ benefits and leading to the loss of patronage In response to this phenomenon, this paper develops a promotion model for small and medium manufacturing enterprise based on data mining and uses the improved association rules algorithm in the model. This provides a theoretical basis for small and medium manufacturing enterprises sales promotion from the quantitative view. Using this model to analyze a cleaning product enterprise is to prove its feasibility II  A N IMPROVED A PRIORI ALGORITHM FOR ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  A  Notations In the data mining community, data are often collected in the form of transaction database. Given a transaction database D={T 1 T 2 T n each T j j=1,2,…n\ is called a transaction which is consist of several items {CD 1 CD p The corpus of all items contained in database D is denoted by CD={CD 1 CD 2 CD m A subset of CD is called an itemset e.g., T is an itemset and T 002 CD. Take the sales data analysised in this paper as an example: the items refer to the goods on sale; a transaction corresponds to a sale bill in the sale database, including several sale goods \(items\. Each transaction has a unique identifier TID 1  X 003 Y is called an association rule where X, Y are subsets of corpus CD. Often two common indicators are used to measure an association rule: support s \(probability that a 000\034\000\032\000\033\000\020\000\024\000\020\000\031\000\024\000\025\000\033\000\027\000\020\000\026\000\024\000\024\000\020\000\032\000\022\000\024\000\024\000\022 000\007 000\025 000\031 000\021 000\023 000\023 000\003 000k 000\025\000\023\000\024\000\024\000\003\000,\000\(\000\(\000 


transaction contains the X Y, i.e., s=P\(X Y\nd confidence c \(conditional probability that a transaction having X also contains Y, i.e., c=P\(Y|X\/P\(X\\.An association rule is said to be frequent when its support sup is larger than a minimum support In this paper, we design a sparse data structure for description of the transaction database. Formally, an item  is represented by a row vector \(d j1 d jm where     0   1 Ti CDj Ti CDj ij d    1 In fact, item CD j lists the indexes of those transactions which contain this item. Thus all the items form a matrix D CD 1 CD 2 CD n i.e  2 A 2-itemset D ij is defined as the intersection of items CD i  and CD j which lists the indexes of those transactions which contain both of the two items. It can be easily computed as 3 Here is the logical AND operator. Hence, support count of 2-itemset D ij is   4 In the similar way, a k-itemset is   5  And its support is     6   B  An modified Apriori algorithm for the association rules mining In this section, we introduce a modified association rules mining algorithm based on our specially designed sparse data structure. The algorithm is implemented with two steps frequent itemsets are first mined using Apriori, then association rules are generated from the mined frequent itemsets. We detail them as follows 1  Mining of  frequent  itemsets Given a minimum support s min we are to find all the subsets of corpus CD with their support more than s min We modify the classic Apriori algorithm with the specially designed sparse data structure. It consists of four main parts 1\ Initially scan the database once to get frequent 1-itemset 2\enerate length k+1 candidate itemset from length k frequent itemset; \(3\Test the candidates against database W.R.T. the minimum support; \(4\ Terminate when no frequent candidate set can be generated Step \(3\ usually time-consuming, which in our setting can be efficiently done. As the database \(i.e., matrix D\ is sparse, with each element occupying one bit, we can load it into memory and count the support of k-itemset using Eq.\(4 which needs only Bit-AND operation. Algorithm 1 gives the pseudocode of our modified Apriori algorithm, as in Fig.1  Figure 1  Pseudocode of modified Apriori algorithm 2  Generation  of  association  rules Given the mined frequent itemsets, it is easy to generate association rules: Test all the frequent itemsets then check all their proper subsets with minimum confidence c min For example, F is a frequent itemset; S is one of its proper subsets Hence, c\(S\ = s\(S\/s\(T\. If c\(S\>c min output rule S  T\\S Here T\\S is the complement of S III  TYPES  OF  SALES  PROMOTION  AND  DEVELOP  SALES  PROMOTION  MODEL A  Types of sales promotion Sales promotion SP can be divided into three types   Level 1 SP: the promotion of manufacturers to wholesalers; the promotion of manufacturers to retailers; the promotion of manufacturers to consumers; the promotion of wholesalers to retailers the promotion of wholesalers to consumers; the promotion of retailers to consumers   Level 2 SP: the promotion of manufacturers to wholesalers and retailers; the promotion of manufacturers to retailers and consumers; the promotion of manufacturers to wholesalers and consumers; the promotion of wholesalers to retailers a the promotion of manufacturers to wholesalers 


  Level 3 SP: the promotion of manufacturers to wholesaler, retailers and consumers The sales promotion model in this paper refers to level 2 SP. That is to say, we develop the sales promotion model of manufacturers to wholesalers and retailers B  Develop a data mining model for promotion  in manufacturing industry In data preparation stage, at first, objectives for developing a sales promotion model should be clear. Then, scan the transaction database D to gain the needed data sheet In data preprocessing stage, firstly remove irrelevant items and noise data by data statute from the data sheet.  Secondly code the data by time series. Thirdly classify the data into m sheets from the new sheet .We can define the sheets in this way sheet i i=1,2,…m In data mining stage, we use the improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix storage to analyze the data in sheet m  Moreover, in this algorithm we use adaptive minimum support s min and minimum confidence c min because of the diversities of data in these sheets In summary and evaluation stage, we can get the corresponding association rules from the sheets by using improved Apriori algorithm. Then, we need to interpret rules and make the evaluation 14-15  According to these stages, we can develop a data mining model for sales promotion in manufacturing industry, as in Fig.2   Figure 2  A data mining model for sales promotion in manufacturing industry IV  A PPLICATION  The sales promotion model based on data mining in manufacturing enterprises and improved  associated rules algorithm are applied to the small cleaning products manufacturing company A. The sales data from July to August in 2010 are analyzed to identify strong correlated itemsets to prove the feasibility of the sales promotion model and to provide a theoretical basis for the following promotion A  Data preparation All sales orders in every major area systems company A are taken out from the database D from July to August in 2010 working date. These orders are integrated into a single sheet sheet1. Sheet 1 includes 1006 sales itemsets and 233 sales transactions B  Data preprocessing 1  Data Statute The process of data statute is to delete some lines and columns in the sheet, and to reduce the number of column values Summary table of sales data sheet1 statute and remove nonrelevant data field, the remaining sales order number, stock code, stock name, quantity, unit price, total price, sales of single amount in sheet1. Remove 23 retail lists and seven system adjustment sales orders in Sheet 1 the remaining sales orders are 213, that is to say, sales transaction T has 213 Make data statute for total sales sheet1. Firstly remove nonrelevant data fields and remain sales order number, stock code stock name, quantity, unit price, total price, the amount of sales order. Secondly, cut out 23 retail orders and 7 system adjustment orders. There are remaining 213 transactions in the sheet1 2  Data classification With the customers of enterprise A existing the large differences in purchasing scale, association analysis is obviously inaccurate to set only a minimum support and minimum confidence for the overall data. We can classify the sales transactions by purchasing scale. Moreover, we should set the adaptive minimum support and minimum confidence to different classifications. So the total sales sheet1 is classified into small-scale procurement sheet, general scale of procurement sheet, large-scale procurement sheet, and ultralarge-scale procurement sheet, according to the sales amount Si 0,1000\, S i  1000,5000\S i  5000,10000\S i  10000 Besides these four sheets are assigned from sheet 2  to sheet 5 In this place, we classify data first, then delete the data of sale goods  to ensure the accuracy of classification C  Data conversion First, make data coding. With the original database having the sales data of East China Region, South China Region Southwest China Region and North China Region, the exported data exist one sales order number corresponding to some sales orders. Therefore the sales order numbers Transaction ID\(TID require rearrangement ID. 213 transactions in the total sales 


sheet1 are coded according to chronological order. So we sign TID from 0701001 to 0831213 Second, because the stock code of goods is complex, the stock code is needed to restate. The codes of the initial rearrangement are from CD 1 to CD 68 That is to say, the whole itemset include 68 items And then subtotal goods frequency which the codes of the rearrangement corresponding to. Draw a figure about goods frequency in original account sales as in Fig.3  Figure 3  Goods frequency in original account sales Finally, the data encoded again: analyzing sheet1, we find the products have the old bar and new bar code. And we also find that some kinds of products are used of old and new bar code, so that the stock code can not lead to one mapping of inventories. We need to classify the products of old and new bar code as a class. So we adds the products of the old bar code to the new bar code . A total of 25 old items are deleted and the remaining 43 items are encoded again. That is, item is expressed as {CD i i = 1,2 ... 43}. Draw a figure about goods frequency in improved account sales, as in Fig.4  Figure 4  Goods frequency in improved account sales D  Association Rules Mining At first, we need to set the value for minimum support s min  and minimum confidence c min By analyzing the data in each group, we can find the obvious diversities between the data in each sheet. So using the same minimum support and minimum confidence will produce large deviation. In this place, we use adaptive minimum support s min and minimum confidence c min  to reduce the deviation. We can set minimum support in each sheet, as in \(7\ Specific value as in table  7 TABLE I  S PECIFIC  VALUE  Sales Amount Transaction Count Minimum Support  Minimum Confidence S<1000 117 7 40 1000=<S<5000 47 10 40 5000=<S<10000 9 3 40 10000=<S 39 8 70  We can take TC=39 as a example to describe the following step. As we can see from table 1, in this group S>=10000 .So it is a large-scale procurement. s min is 8 and c min is 70 Scan the sheet 4 to get the Boolean matrix, which we call it candidate itemset C 1 In this matrix, line represents the items which every transaction corresponds to and column represents the transactions which every item corresponds to. Then compare support with s min We can get 1-frequent itemset matrix \(FIS1\, as in Fig.5  Figure 5  The image of 1-frequent itemset matrix Figure 5: The image of 1-frequent itemset matrix. As each itemset is a row vector which is consist of binary values 0 or 1. All the row vectors form a matrix. Hence, we build a binary image, with black blocks representing value 0 and white ones representing 1.  It is obvious that the matrix is sparse  Next, we can get candidate itemset C k from FIS1. Scan FIS1 matrix to get the support count for Ck and get the kfrequent itemset \(FIS k as in Fig.6 Then, we can get the association rules from all frequent itemsets. As in table At last, comparing confidence with c min we need to cut the table to get the final association rules, which can provide the basis for large-scale procurement of sales promotion. Final association rules table as in table  Description of the final association rules as in table

Then make suitable sales promotion programs for these customers V  CONCLUSION According to these, it is effective to make a practical application by developing a data mining model for sales promotion in manufacturing industry. In order to reduce promotion cost and increase sales amount, we use this model to recommend enterprises kinds of sales promotion strategies for customers who are in different purchasing scale. What is more, this model has taken a successful experience for other small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises to develop a sales promotion model. However, the improved Apriori algorithm we applied in this paper has a shortage in the efficiency of data mining.

        Step 6: Using elimination method in step 3 to the submatrixes and Qi queue  by decreasing order until no new sub-matrix can be divided out Step 7: Selecting the combination of rows in the submatrixes According to the minimum support threshold and rows and columns selected in advance in step 3, the number of row which Qi is more than minimum support threshold will be selected out. Selected rows will be combined. The number of possible combinations is r nC : n is the number of rows selected; r is the minimum support threshold Because there are rows or columns selected in advance in step 3, it is necessary to take into account this factor There are four cases discussed The case 1: there is no selected rows and columns in advance Because no selected rows and columns in advance, this case can be dealt with according to normal conditions The case 2: there is rows selected in advance Because there are the rows selected in advance, the number of rows to be selected can be reduced. The number of possible combinations is r t n tC  t is the number of rows selected in advance. In this way, computation can be reduced to improve the algorithm efficiency The case 3: there is columns selected in advance Because there are the columns selected in advance these columns become the part of the maximal frequent itemset. These columns do not change the method. In the 


end, these columns are only added to maximal frequent itemset selected The case 4: there are selected rows and columns in advance The case 4 is the combination of the case 2 and the case 3 According to the case 2, we can use the way to reduce the number of rows. By the case 3, we can use the way to add the columns selected in advance to the maximal frequent itemset, together with the composition of maximal frequent itemset Step 8: Searching for maximal frequent itemset. In accordance with the selected combination of rows, all of one-itemset supports Pi are computed out. The maximal frequent itemset is composed of itemset which the oneitemset supports Pi equals to minimum support threshold The number of the items in the itemset is the maximal frequent itemset length I4 I5 I6 1 1 1 3 1 1  2 1 1 2 2 2 I3 I6 1  1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1421 4 B.an example To explain the use of the above algorithm, the following will illustrate an example Transaction database D is as shown in table 6. Let minimum support threshold be min_s = 2 TABLE VI.  TRANSACTION DATABASE D       


     Step 1: Setting up an associated matrix. It is as shown in table 7 TABLE VII.

All Pi are \(6,7,6,1,2 All Qj are  \(3,1,2,3,2,2,2,4,3 Step 3: Using elimination method to remove the rows and columns of the associated matrix according to certain conditions. Here are items for the I4 column and transaction for T800 row to be eliminated. The I4 column is eliminated by the first condition. The T800 row is eliminated by the forth condition. All Pi are \(5,6,5,1 Qj are \(3,1,2,2,2,2,2,3 is as shown in table 8 TABLE VIII.

ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE COMPARISON All the experiments are performed on a AMD Athlon 64*2 Dual core processor 3800+ PC machine with 1G main memory, running on Microsoft Windows XP. All the programs are written in Microsoft Visual C++6.0 Experimental data is generated randomly by programming. And the number of items is 39 Experiment result shows that the efficiency of the counting algorithm is higher in comparison with Apriori algorithm and FP-tree algorithm. It is as shown in Figure 1               Figure 1.  Relationship of the support threshold with time consumption V. CONCLUSION The core of association mining is mining frequent itemset. Directly searching for maximal frequent itemset can increase efficiency of association mining algorithm This paper presents a new mining algorithm looking for Maximal Frequent Itemset. The algorithm with simply counting the value of rows and columns on associated matrix can find out the maximal frequent itemset and greatly simplifies the complexity of association mining algorithm. Analysis and experiments show that this algorithm has obvious advantages ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
