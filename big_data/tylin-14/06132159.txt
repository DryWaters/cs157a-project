Research on Ideological and Political Education based on Family & F riendship in University Ma Xiangyang Beihua University College of  First Clinical Medical Jilin, China Xiangym00@163.com Abstract This paper studies the application of family and friendship education carried out in scattered learning position The role of teacher and communication are studied based on participant ideological and political education students in a family and friendship class. The result of study demonstrated the different effects of teacher’s teaching effectiveness such as expending, rhetorical and provocative. Further, teach in family and friendship education class lacks communication often fails 
and proper system back-channel cues as a teaching result feedback. The study result also shows that there is balance lack between the students and teacher in the distribution of understand, eventually leading to interaction is in one-way Normally, the students become an recipients in class reacting against lack feedback. Statement and question posed by teacher is designed to break the barriers through mediating technology. Also Both sides of teacher and student are frequently impaired by practice , misunderstand is described as a education space connected by the communication technology Keywords-adult; continuing education;distanse education

This education method to enrich sides both teacher and student in the classroom. The family and friendship classroom is a Audio-visual environment in which modern communication technology. The communication technology between human actor and physical settings is a interplay part of practice. The materiality of workplaces and schools by Jilin university\(2003\d the impact of actor in family and 
friendship education by beihua university\(2010\. This paper pays close attention to how the different forms of communicate between students, teacher and technicians in family and friendship education place The significance and individual of group behavior to judge the meaning of faces has been studied by foreign scholars in everyday life. Perspective views interaction as performance that is shaped by environment and audience and staged to give others in impressions which are constant with hoped goals of the actor. This can be considered as “real teaching practices” would have established a different range of constructions of interaction and enlarged the ways actors 
influence themselves in their exchange with others. Gofman proposed an actor expects to present himself effectively to maximum the success presentation. Interactive teamwork with students and teachers makes an important chance to the individual’s evaluation as well as the evaluation of a team or group. It can be considered that successful exchange in family and friendship education is dependent on the bilateral definition of the station as a teaching work holding the premises face-to-face exchange origination from common education II C ALSS OBSERVATION The research is based on observations of participant 
guided by an study strategy in which the studier is identifiable Atkinson & Hammersley 2001 and by gentle participation where the studier does not participate in the class activities actively\(W J. walt & W J. walt 2003 The research covers both qualitative and quantitative outcomes. The qualitative aspect of communication accounts on the character of utterances and the allocation of utterances while the quantitative results focus for the frequency made in classroom. The research comprises forty seven different occasions made between 2002 and 2004 at four different local learning classroom. The data were collected at two 
location. The most important observation lasted for approximately eight hour and was transcribe similar and recorded to the procedure of convenience interviews The observation data used in the research concern the different education forms both common education and family and friendship education sites. The remote class site is the physical site of local education center\(ideological and political education locality\. In the remote education site data were watched directly on comprise and spot both the student’s face-to-face educate and the interaction with the students and teacher at the classroom. Datum mining plays a more important role in the intelligent study making. The aim 
of datum mining is to refine some important information that is mixed in the already exists databases. Classification is a method of datum analysis that is used to refine model for distinguishing important datum or predicting the data trends There are a lot of classification techniques to predict the trends of datum. Associative neural network that uses association rule mining among the refine rule process has   ___________________________________  978161284 70 4 7/11 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE  


shown powerful advantage than many other classification ways. The aim of association rules is to refine frequent patterns, interesting correlations, casual construction or associations in sets of among the transaction datum. In this paper, the technique for neural classification using ANN system had been studied The origin site is the site where the students\(In most cases is teachers\are located during classroom family and friendship process such as fig.1  teacher Admission School education Ideological and Political Education Professional learning Graduate education Employment family and friendship student Figure 1 The observation process of family and friendship education Datum from the origin location was recorded from the internet. The observational transmission altered between all observations and different remote site made on inspection concerned participant engaged in ideological and political education III I NTERACTION IN THE FAMILY AND FRIENDSHIP EDUCATION CLASSROOM The observation datum shows that there are double main styles of communication in family and friendship education classrooms that needed to study. Non-verbal and verbal communication. The spoken communication language involves expresses made in site addressing teachers, students or technicians. Further, the observation results show that there are three main styles of expresses significant for practice of family and friendship education. Statements questions and storytelling The observation data used in the research concern the different education forms both common education and family and friendship education sites.

In this paper, the technique for neural classification using observation system had been studied In the remote education site, data were watched directly on comprise and spot both the student’s face-to-face educate and the interaction with the students and teacher at the classroom Interaction in the family and friendship education classroom process such as Fig.2 Observation student Information collection Education method three students teachers method Teaching results statistics evaluation N Y Figure 2 Interaction in the family and friendship education classroom process The research also demonstrates that ‘small talk’ and storytelling are important for communication in class Storytelling refers to the anecdotes told by the teacher or by the students during On-site teaching. Anecdotes and storytelling do not involve necessarily questions although some kind of response is found from the audience Correspondence is the Complementary approaches of the technicians and teachers. Correspondence takes place mainly inside the teamwork of the remote site and may involve both statements and questions The research also demonstrates that ‘small talk’ and storytelling are important for communication in class Storytelling refers to the anecdotes told by the teacher or by the students during On-site teaching. Anecdotes and storytelling do not involve necessarily questions although 


some kind of response is found from the audience Correspondence is the Complementary approaches of the technicians and teachers. Correspondence takes place mainly inside the teamwork of the remote site and may involve both statements and questions From education’s perspective questions directed at students usually consider the matter Teachers may propose questions to students for any reasons to investigate an interesting topic, to the find students knowledge or to follow up learned assignments and lectures Questions could also consider practice or and theory result in solving problems, factual answers or reasoned ideas or develop imaginative Based on the students’ exposed questions concerning the results are rarely asked of the peers or teacher during the family and friendship education class The most frequent concerning results of family and friendship education remote sites at learning classroom in China, questions proposed by students instead consider administrative or common matters For example the students want to think forms of examination, outlines for submitting written works or the time and date of future tasks The difference in the common of the questions is important to family and friendship education The teacher focuses on the detail while student is engaged in rules forms and settings IV STATEMENTS AND Q UESTIONS The teacher is an executor who explains informs and describes the state of knowledge opinion and circumstance to the students As mentioned a important amount of the teachers’ teaching is based on questions. All data show that the questions asked in family and friendship education class have significant functions The function follow as  expanding function r  hetorical function  management function  provocative function Other questions proposed in the classroom are intended to dialogue Datum mining plays a more important role in the intelligent study making. The aim of datum mining is to refine some important information that is mixed in the already exists databases. Classification is a method of datum analysis that is used to refine model for distinguishing important datum or predicting the data trends. There are a lot of classification techniques to predict the trends of datum Associative neural network that uses association rule mining among the refine rule process has shown powerful advantage than many other classification ways. The aim of association rules is to refine frequent patterns, interesting correlations casual construction or associations in sets of among the transaction datum. The most frequent concerning results of family and friendship education remote sites at learning classroom in China, questions proposed by students instead consider administrative or common matters For example the students want to think forms of examination, outlines for submitting written works or the time and date of future tasks In this paper, the technique for neural classification using ANN system had been studied For example when the students have been asked is there anything else you are thinking about or students to give their points of view as in the instance below. The statements and questions process such as Fig.3  Teacher:Student A can you comment on the election in China Teacher:Does anyone else have something to add Teacher:No,he had raped and humiliated and forced two women into prostitution.Isn’t it good that he was given the maximum punishment Teacher We’ll start in the municipality of student with topics of the day.Is there anything you’d like to tell us Teacher Hate crimes have increased in the Chinese society. Such crimes are directed at homosexuals, but also religious groups such as Tibet and Xinjiang These crimes have been increased in few years Teacher:\(…\y now there is plenty written here whiteboard  w h ich h a s to b e  proved right? And I can’t hear any of you protesting loudly Student I don’t think this is correct at all. Do you want me to explain why Teacher Yes, please Teacher Do you think the form is demanding nowadays, to write neatly and correctly Student Yes Teacher Yes, isn’t it Teacher What is a society Student We are the society Teacher Yes, aren’t we Figure 3 statements and questions process Based on the students’ exposed questions concerning the results are rarely asked of the peers or teacher during the family and friendship education class The most frequent concerning results of family and friendship education remote sites at learning classroom in China, questions proposed by students instead consider administrative or common matters For example the students want to think forms of examination, outlines for submitting written works or the time and date of future tasks The difference in the common of the questions is important to family and friendship 


education The teacher focuses on the detail while student is engaged in rules forms and settings. such as Tab.1 TABLE I D ISTRIBUTION OF UTTERANCES IN FAMILY AND FRIENDSHIP EDUCATION CLASS      University college\(20 observational occasions remote site origin classroom distribution oriented communication  multi- between teacher and students Adult education\(18 observational occasions remote

Let the minimum support threshold be 2 TABLE II.  A TRANSACTION DATABASE AS RUNNING EXAMPLE, DB  Because only the frequent items will play a role in the frequent pattern mining, it is necessary to scan the DB once to identify the set of frequent items \(L1 compactness, we order L1 in support descending order L1={f:4, c:4, a:3, b:3, m:3, p:3, l:2, o:2 DB for a second time to construct the FP-tree. The construction algorithm of a FP-tree is proposed in [10 Readers are referred to the cited paper for details. The FP-tree in a Share-struct is almost the same as the one in [10] except for each notes parent and next fields. They are redundant in Share-struct, so they are removed. Afterwards, we create the first Share-table S? according to L1.

PERFORMANCE STUDY To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms, we have done extensive experiments on various kinds of datasets with different features. The experiments are based on a 2.4GMHz Pentium IV PC with 512MB main memory and 60 GB hard driver, running on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. All the programs are written in Microsoft/Visual C++6.0 The measured performance is algorithms execution time on the datasets with different minimum support threshold. The execution time only includes the disk reading time \(scan datasets output frequent patterns speed of disk writing A. Datasets and characteristics We use real world and synthetic data for our performance study. The basic characteristics of datasets are listed in the following The real world dataset called Retail is achieved from a retailing company. Retail contains products from various categories. There are 16469 items and 88162 transactions in the dataset. Each transaction consists of the products purchased by a customer at a time point. Its average transaction size and average maximal potentially frequent patterns size are 10.3 and 3. The size of this dataset is 4M The synthetic data sets which were used for the experiments were achieved from the online FIMI repository See the RUL: http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/. The data sets are T10I4D100K and T40I10D100K. In T10I4D100K, the average record size and average maximal potentially frequent patterns 


size are 10 and 4. In T40I10D100K, they are 40 and 10. The numbers of transactions in both two dataset are set to 100K There are exponentially numerous frequent patterns when the support threshold goes down B. Experimental results In order to mine the utility frequent patterns, we randomly generate the count of each item between 1 and 6. In fact, most items are in the low profit range, we synthetically generate utility values of each item from 0.01 to 10.00, using a log normal distribution. For instance, Fig.2 shows the distribution of the utility values of items in T10I4D100K 1432 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 N um be r o f i te m s Utility value  Figure 2.  Utility value distribution in T10I4D100K For selecting appropriate utility thresholds, we use the average transaction utility value to constraint the utility threshold instead of randomly choosing it. For example, in Table 1, where the average transaction utility value is 40. If the utility threshold is equal to 25%, it represents that ? = 10 40  25% =10 We compare the performance of Share-FPM with BUUFM [5], an up to date algorithm for utility frequent patterns 


mining. Fig.3 through Fig.5 show the performance curves of two algorithms on three datasets respectively. We can see that the Share-UFPM algorithm outperforms BU-UFM on all datasets, and the performance gap becomes significant when the minimum support threshold drops low enough 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 Ti m e S ec on ds  Minimum support \(%0 Share-UFPM BU-UFM Utility threshold=5  Figure 3.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we introduce a utility frequent pattern mining model based on a share strategy to find the combination of items with high frequencies and utilities. This model first find all patterns with a given minimum support threshold. In this step, a share strategy gives a way to share most of the results from the previous mining process instead of separating them distinctively, thereby dramatically reducing the cost of computation. And then all patterns that do not satisfy a minimum utility threshold are pruned The extension of our technique, for maintenance of the already mined utility frequent patterns when updating databases, is an interesting topic for future research REFERENCES 1] R.

the time needed for execution exceeded 100000 seconds Thus, from this analysis we see that FPrep, which uses FCM clustering, clearly outperforms the CLARANS and CURE based methods on the basis of speed. The execution times for CLARANS and CURE mentioned in fig. 7 and Table II do not include the time required to create fuzzy sets, and calculate the membership value  for each numerical data point in every fuzzy set for the numerical attribute under consideration. These times also do not take into account the time required to transform crisp numerical attributes to fuzzy attributes, and derive the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset The fuzzy partitions generated for each of the five numerical attributes for the USCensus1990raw dataset are shown in Table III. Coincidentally, generating three fuzzy partitions for each numerical attribute seemed a perfect fit In addition to the superior speeds achieved by FPrep, as illustrated in fig. 7 and Table II, Table III indicates the semantics and the quality of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. Moreover, the number of frequent itemsets generated by a fuzzy ARM algorithm \(like fuzzy ARMOR and fuzzy Apriori minimum support threshold, is illustrated in fig. 8   Fig. 7. Algorithm, numerical attribute comparison based on speed \(log10 seconds   Fig. 8. Number of frequent itemsets for various minimum support values  B. Results from Second Dataset We have also applied FPrep on the FAM95 dataset http://www.stat.ucla.edu/data/fpp transactions. Of the 23 attributes in the dataset, we have used the first 18, of which six are quantitative and the rest are binary. For each of the six quantitative attributes, we have generated fuzzy partitions using FPrep. A thorough analysis with respect to execution times, has already been performed on the USCensus1990raw dataset \(which is manifolds bigger in size than the FAM95 dataset both on the basis of number of transactions and number of unique values for numerical 


attributes dataset has been done solely to provide further evidence of the quality and semantics of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. The details of the same are in Table IV. In this case, the number of fuzzy partitions is different for different numerical attributes. Thus, the number and type of fuzzy partitions to be generated is totally dependent on the attribute under consideration. A graphical representation of the fuzzy partitions generated for the attribute Age has already been provided in fig. 5, and clearly shows the Gaussian nature of the fuzzy partitions. The nature and shapes of fuzzy partitions for the rest of the attributes are also similar. Last, the number of frequent itemsets generated for different minimum support values is illustrated in fig. 8  C. Analysis of Results With FPrep, we can analyze and zero in on the number and type of partitions required based on the semantics of the numerical attributes, which the methods detailed in [19 20] do not necessarily facilitate. Then, FPrep, backed by FCM clustering, takes care of the creating the fuzzy partitions, especially assigning membership values for each numerical data point in each fuzzy partition. In section 8.A we have already shown that FPrep is nearly 9 to 44 times faster than the CURE-based method, and 2672 to 13005 times faster than the CLARANS-based method. FPrep is not only much faster than other related methods, but also generates very high quality fuzzy partitions \(Table III and IV much user-intervention. We have created a standard way of representing any fuzzy dataset \(converted from any type of crisp dataset efficacy of the same is corroborated by the successful implementation of Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR on the fuzzy dataset \(converted from crisp version of FAM95 dataset an initial implementation of Fuzzy ARMOR, are very encouraging. FPrep, when used in conjunction with these fuzzy ARM algorithms, generates a pretty good number of high-quality frequent itemsets \(fig. 8 frequent itemsets generated for a particular minimum support is same, irrespective of the fuzzy ARM algorithm 


used IX. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have highlighted our methodology, called FPrep, for ARM in a fuzzy scenario. FPrep is meant for seamlessly and holistically transforming a crisp dataset into a fuzzy dataset such that it can drive a subsequent fuzzy ARM process. It does not rely on any non-fuzzy techniques and is thus more straightforward, fast, and consistent. It facilitates user-friendly automation of fuzzy dataset 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Age - 91 Hours - 100 Income3 4949 Income2 13707 Income1 55089 Ti m e lo g1 0 se co nd s Numerical Attribute - Number of Unique Values FCM CURE CLARANS 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500

This methodology involves two distinct steps, namely creation of appropriate fuzzy partitions using fuzzy clustering and creation of fuzzy records, using these partitions, to get the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset FPrep has been compared with other such techniques, and has been found to better on the basis of speed. We also illustrate its efficacy on the basis of quality of fuzzy partitions generated and the number of itemsets mined by a fuzzy ARM algorithm which is preceded by FPrep. This preprocessing technique provides us with a standard method of fuzzy data \(record that it is useful for any kind of fuzzy ARM algorithm irrespective of how the algorithm works. Furthermore, this pre-processing methodology has been adequately tested with two disparate fuzzy ARM algorithms, Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR, and would also work fine with other fuzzy ARM algorithm REFERENCES 1] Zadeh, L.

The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
