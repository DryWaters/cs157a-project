Michael Massanari Research for the Critical Junctures Institute Michael.Massanari@wwu.edu Abstract  Discovering infrequent causal relationships can help us prevent or correct negative outcomes caused by their antecedents. In this paper, we propose an innovative data 
mining framework and apply it to mine potential causal associations in electronic patient datasets where the drugrelated events of interest occur infrequently. Specifically, we created a novel interestingness measure exclusive causalleverage based on a computational, fuzzy recognition-primed decision \(RPD\ model that we previously developed. On the basis of this new measure, a data mining algorithm was developed to mine the causal relationship between drugs and their associated adverse drug reactions \(ADRs\ The algorithm was tested on real patient data retrieved from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit, Michigan. The exclusive causal-leverage was employed to rank the potential causal associations between each of the two selected drugs \(i.e enalapril and pravastatin\ and 3,954 recorded symptoms, each 
of which corresponds to a potential ADR. The top 10 drugsymptom pairs for each drug were evaluated by our physicians on the project team. The results showed that the number of symptoms considered as real ADRs for enalapril and pravastatin was 8 and 7 out of 10, respectively Keywords-Causal association rules; electronic health database; adverse drug reactions; fuzzy recognition-primed decision model I   I NTRODUCTION  In many real-world applications, it is important to mine causal relationships where an event or event pattern causes certain outcomes with low probability. For example, a drug used at an appropriate dose may cause one or more adverse drug reactions \(ADRs\, although the probability is low Discovering this kind of causal relationships can help us prevent or correct negative outcomes caused by its 
antecedents. However, mining these relationships is challenging due to the difficulty of capturing causality among events and the infrequent nature of the events of interest in these applications Finding the association between two event sets is an active and important area of data mining research. Much work has been conducted in this area during the past two decades [1, 2  A n asso cia tio n ru l e is an  im p lica t i o n  expression in the form of X Y 
002 where X and Y are two event sets and they are disjoint \(i.e XY 
003  meaning 
that they share no common events. Both X and Y may contain one or more events. An association rule indicates that the presence of X implies the presence of Y  Many measures have been proposed to mine association rules. For instance, the support and confidence measures were the original interestingness measures proposed for association rules [3 T h e support of an association rule supp  X Y

and Y occur at least once, among all the event sequences The confidence of an association rule is defined as conf  X Y 
002 where supp  X 002 the proportion of sequences that contain X  Given these two measures, the association rule mining problem can be formalized as finding those rules whose support and confidence are greater than pre-specified thresholds minsupp

and minconf respectively. The most famous algorithm for finding frequent events is the Apriori algorithm  R e sea r c h er s have  a l s o prop o s ed va ri o u s  o t her interestingness measures such as IS  K l o s g e n\222s m e a s ur e 5  w e ig h t ed r e la tiv e a ccu r acy  6  an d s o on   Originated from areas such as probability, statistics or information theory, traditional interestingness measures are primarily designed for finding frequent association rules Thus, they have limited capability in discovering patterns that occur infrequently For example, bromfenac \(Duract was a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent \(NSAID\ that was removed by the Food and Drug Administration \(FDA from the market in 1998 because it caused serious hepatotoxicity in only 1 in 20,000 patients taking the drug for longer than 10 days [7  I f t h e 
support and confidence  measures, for instance, were used to mine an electronic health database, it is very difficult to discover interesting ADRs due to their infrequency nature. Instead, associations between drugs and their treated diseases are very likely to be detected since they have relatively high frequencies. But these associations are expected and not of clinical interest Note that symptoms of an ADR cannot be easily distinguished from those of an underlying disease in electronic health databases because both of them are encoded using the same ICD-9 \(International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision\odes. To discover those rare ADRs thresholds minsupp and minconf would have to be set very

small. But this would lead to a lot of false associations and make the computational cost of the mining algorithm extremely high [8  A n o t h e r  p itf al l o f  tr ad iti o n a l  interestingness measures is that they simply find the statistical correlation between X  and Y  They are not able to capture the causal relationships between two event sets They do not specify whether X  causes Y  or vice versa, or a third event causes the co-existence of X  and Y  We are interested in mining the casual relationships between two event sets that occur relatively infrequently Studies on mining causal association rules are still limited in the literature. Bayesian network and its variants have been borrowed to mine casual structures in a couple of studies [9 10  On e c r i tic is m of B ay es i an an aly s is is i t s  re qu i r em en t t o  specify prior distributions for all variables, which can be very difficult since, in many cases, prior knowledge is vague or non-existent, or can be tedious if the number of variables is large [11 Silv ers t ein  et al  p r op os e d  a c o n s t r a i n t b as e d  algorithm that narrowed down the search space and thus made the mining process more scalable H o w e ve r  t h e s e approaches are inherently probability-based and designed to find frequent patterns. Thus, they have limited capability in discovering infrequent associations Our study was motivated by the need of discovering ADRs in postmarketing surveillance, even though the proposed framework can be applied to many different applications. In the literature, there exist a couple of studies 8, 13 h at a t t e m p t e d t o fi nd t h e  a ssoc i at i o ns be t w e e n dr ugs  and potential ADRs by mining their temporal relationships That is, they tried to mine temporal association rules represented as T X Y 
004\004\002 here Y occurs  after X within a time window of length T  These studies obtained promising results based on administrative health data. However temporal association was the only parameter used for linking a symptom with a drug within each patient case in their work. Temporal association assumes that cause precedes effect. Other parameters such as dechallenge and rechallenge can also give direct or indirect cues of the association of a drug-symptom pair. Dechallenge is defined as the relationship between withdrawal of the drug and abatement of the adverse effect. Rechallenge describes the relationship between re-introduction of the drug followed by recurrence of the adverse event. In addition, their approaches suffer from the sharp boundary problem. On the one hand, the symptom events near the time boundaries are either ignored or overemphasized. On the other hand, two symptom events contribute equally to the interestingness measure as long as they occur within the hazard period T That is, the length of the time duration between exposure to the drug and occurrence of the symptom has no effect on the interestingness measure. This is not true in reality because if an ADR symptom occurs within a shorter period, it is usually more likely to be caused by the drug To more effectively mine infrequent causal associations we developed an experience-based data mining framework that relied on a computational fuzzy recognition-primed decision \(RPD\odel [14  Mo re de t a i l s a b ou t t h e f u z z y  RPD model will be introduced in the next section. The model was utilized to evaluate the degree of causality between two events X  and Y for each sequence using more parameters including dechallenge and rechallenge. We then defined an interestingness measure called exclusive causal-leverage that incorporated the causalities for all sequences. The measure not only captured potential causality between two events but also addressed the infrequency issue. The reason is that, for a causal association rule, the contribution of each sequence to this interestingness measure depends on the degree of causality between the causal event and the consequent event within that sequence. Hence, relatively infrequent association rules may get a high value of the interestingness measure as long as each supporting sequence exhibits high causality Furthermore, the new measure incorporated an exclusion mechanism that can effectively reduce the undesirable effects caused by frequent events. Based on the exclusive causal-leverage measure, we developed a data mining algorithm which was evaluated in the context of detecting the causal relationships between drugs and their associated ADRs recorded in electronic health databases II  B ACKGROUND ON ADR S AND F UZZY RPD  M ODEL  A  Adverse Drug Reactions ADRs represent a serious world-wide problem [15   T h ey  can complicate a patient\222s medical condition or contribute to increased morbidity, even death. Studies have shown that ADRs contribute to about 5% of all hospital admissions and represent the 5 th commonest cause of death in hospitals [1 In the year 2000, for example, about 7,000 deaths in the U.S were attributed to ADRs [17    Even though pre-marketing clinical trials are required for all new drugs before they are approved for marketing, these trials are necessarily limited in sample-size and duration, and thus are not capable of detecting rare ADRs. In general, an ADR cannot be recognized by these trials if its occurrence rate is less than 0.1 The r e f o re  dr ug sa fet y d e pe nd s  heavily on post-marketing surveillance. In the U.S., current post-marketing surveillance methods primarily rely on the FDA\222s spontaneous reporting system MedWatch TM which is a passive system in that it depends on voluntary, spontaneous reports of suspected ADRs filed by healthcare professionals drug manufactures, and/or consumers [18  D e t e c t i o n o f an ADR generally relies on the FDA\222s retrospective or concurrent review of patient cases. Because ADR reports are filed at the discretion of the users of the system, there is gross underreporting Co nseq ue nt l y  t h e c u rr e n t  approach may require years to identify and withdraw problematic drugs from the market, and result in unnecessary mortality, morbidity, and cost of healthcare. Studies have shown that only half of newly discovered serious ADRs are detected and documented in the Physician\222s Desk Reference  within 7 years after drug approval  As electronic patient records become more and more easily accessible in various health organizations such as hospitals, medical centers, and insurance companies, they provide a new source of information that has great potential to generate ADR signals much earlier [8, 21  N o t e th at  each  patient case can be considered as an event sequence where

various events such as drug prescription, occurrence of a symptom and lab test occur at different times. Our data mining framework was tested on electronic patient records in order to discover the causal associations between drugs and potential ADRs B  Computational Fuzzy RPD Model The RPD model [22 r e p r e s en ts a p o p u l a r c o g n itiv e  decision model. It is particularly useful for modeling how human experts  make decisions based on their prior experiences. It was found that about 50% to 80% of all decisions were made in this way [23  T h e o r ig in al R P D  model is descriptive and is not directly implementable on a computer. Ji et al. developed a fuzzy RPD model [14   w h ich is not only computational but also capable of handling vague and subjective information using fuzzy logic Experiences play a key role in the computational fuzzy RPD model. They are given by domain experts and stored in an experience knowledge base. Each experience consists of four components - cues, goals, actions, and expectancies Cues represent the higher-level information \(synthesized from elementary or environmental data\ that a decision maker must pay attention to. Expectancies describe what will happen next as the current situation continues to evolve in a changing context. Goals represent an end state that the decision maker is trying to achieve. Actions represent a set of potential decisions that the decision maker can take in the current situation The fuzzy RPD model employs \223situation-experience matching\224 decision rules to determine which experience can be reused to solve a new problem. In this process, cues are used to match the current situation with prior experiences The model was preliminarily validated in the field of medicine by comparing the decisions made by the model and those by two independent domain experts. The levels of agreements were measured by the weighted Kappa statistic which is a measure of agreement between two raters after chance agreement is controlled. The results suggested good to excellent agreements [1   III  A  N EW C AUSAL A SSOCIATION M INING F RAMEWORK  In this section, we first introduce how to utilize and extend the fuzzy RPD model to assess the degree of causality between a drug and a potential ADR within one patient case. We then define a new interesting measure that can incorporate causalities among all cases. We finally develop a mining algorithm that can discover potential ADRs from electronic health database using this measure A  Causality Assessment within One Event Sequence We use  X Y and  XY C to represent a pair of events and the degree of causality of the pair in a sequence respectively  XY C is calculated by matching the cue values extracted from a sequence with the cue values of the defined experiences. The ADR detection experiences utilized in this work were acquired through the joint efforts of our engineering and medical team members after careful analysis of the relevant literature. According to the classification scheme in l ar pattern of c u e  values characterizes a specific degree of causality which may require certain courses of action to handle the ADR Therefore, we can define four experiences, each of which is associated with a degree of causality \(i.e., very likely probable, possible and unlikely\. These experiences were stored in an experience knowledge base. Fig. 1 presents a sample experience illustrated in natural language for easier understanding This sample experience has four cues: temporal association, dechallenge, rechallenge, and other explanation The first three cues have been explained in Introduction Other explanations denote alternative explanations by concurrent disease or other drugs. The type of cue could be quantitative, nominal or fuzzy in the computational fuzzy RPD model. For instance, the cue \221temporal association\222 may have fuzzy values \(e.g. unlikely, possible, likely\. Table I shows how the four cues are related to degree of causality of a signal pair in the four experiences After representing the experiences, the next step is to extract the cue values from elementary data for the current situation \(e.g. a new patient case in which a drug-symptom pair need to be evaluated\. Fuzzy rules and fuzzy reasoning are used to achieve this task. For example, to obtain the fuzzy value of temporal association, one of the fuzzy rules of the type \223if the time duration between taking the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event  is short, then temporal association is likely\224 is used. An embedded fuzzy inference engine is employed to perform fuzzy reasoning. The  Figure 1. A sample experience TABLE  I R ELATING C UES TO C AUSALITY C ATEGORY OF A S IGNAL P AIR

  3 where n is the total number of sequences. The advantage of this definition is that the degree of causality is incorporated into the measure such that sequences exhibiting higher causality will contribute more to the measure TABLE  II M EMBERSHIP OF E ACH C AUSALITY C ATEGORY FOR S AMPLE S IGNAL P AIRS PID  M EANS P ATIENT I DENTIFICATION N UMBER      1 m ii XY i Cw

inference engine is what drives the RPD model, updating cues once new information is detected, and monitoring expectancies and goals  After the cue values of the current situation are known, similarity measures are applied to measure the degree of matching between the current situation and prior experiences Specifically, a vector V=\(c 1 c 2 205,c i 205,c m  is used  to represent the set of cue values in an experience, where c i  represents the value of i th cue and m is the total number cues in the experience. Similarly, a vector V\222 c 1 222,c 2 222,\205,c i 222,\205,c m 222 is used to represent the set of cue values extracted from an event sequence. The similarity between a pair of cue values c i and c i 222 is defined as local similarity S L c i c i 222 whose calculation depended on the type of the cue i.e. quantitative, nominal or fuzzy\at is, three similarity calculation formulas are defined, each corresponding to one type of cue. The similarity between two sets of cue values V  and V\222 is named as global similarity S G  V, V\222 It is defined as the weighted sum of all the local similarities with respect to each pair of cue values. Readers are referred to our previous work for specific formulas and examples [1   T h e  global similarity is used to find the most matching experience whose associated causality category can characterize the causal association of a pair of interest in a particular event sequence We use the above approach borrowed from the fuzzy RPD model to obtain a similarity value between the current pair and each of the experiences.  Next, we introduce an approach that utilizes these similarity values to generate a unique number between 0 and 1. This number represents the degree of causality of a pair \(i.e  XY C ithin a particular event sequence First, the similarity values between the current pair and each of the experiences are normalized so that their sum is equal to 1. These normalized values are then used to represent the membership values of corresponding categories for the pair of interest in a particular sequence. For example if the normalized similarity value between a pair and the experience exhibiting \223possible\224 association is 0.6, we would say the causality of the pair is \223possible\224 with a membership value of 0.6 in that sequence. Table II gives several sample drug-symptom pairs as well as their membership values related to each causality category. Note that, given a particular drug, there may exist none, one, or multiple drugsymptom pairs within each patient case. Patient 3, and 6 in the table do not contain drugs and/or symptoms of our interest  XY C is then defined as the weighted sum of the membership values of all causality categories In general, if there exist m  experiences that classifies the causality between X  and Y into m  distinctive categories, the degree of causality is defined as   1   where i 
265 is the membership of the th i  causality category for the pair, and i w represent the corresponding weight when converging all the causality categories into one. Moreover 1 1 m i i 
265   The selection of i w  is based on two considerations. First, causa lity categories representing stronger causal associations should have higher weights That is, if we assume the causality levels represented by m  experience are in a decreasing order, then 21 m www 
212  212    2  where 1 mi 
   must be satisfied, where m w  and 1 w correspond to the highest and lowest causality levels, respectively.  Second the range of  XY C shou h at is   XY C should be 0 for the extreme situation 
  0 0,1 265  where the evidence in a sequence strongly shows \221unlikely\222 association of the pair. If all the evidence in the patient supports \223very likely\224 association \(i.e   1 0  0 265    XY C should be 1. Otherwise  XY C is between 0 and 1. In general, the weight for the th i  causality category is calculated by 1 1 i i w m   1.0, 0.667, 0.333, 0.0 One can see that the computed  XY C using these weights satisfies the above two criterions B  An Exclusive Causal-Leverage Measure We introduce causal association rule \(CAR\enoted by C X Y 265  327

002  supp  X Y 002  002  002  by incorporating the degree of causality of the pair among all sequences into it With better capability of capturing causal associations the causal-leverage measure can be employed to mine the causal association of pair  XY given a collection of event sequences. However, its ability of discovering the causal associations between drugs and their potential ADRs is still limited because of the complexity and special characteristics of electronic health data. Recall that the degree of causal association of a pair within a particular patient case is determined by four cues: temporal association, rechallenge dechallenge, and other explanations. One can see that three of them are time-related. For a particular pair, their values can be abstracted from a specific patient case using fuzzy rules and these values collectively determine the degree of causal association of the pair in the patient case. However the obtained cue values may not really represent the actual causal association of the pair due to the complexity of the electronic health data. One of the complexities is that frequently prescribed drugs are easily temporally associated with any symptom by coincidence. For example, if the hazard period T is equal to 90 days and the start date of a drug appears once every two months within the same case then the drug has temporal association with any symptom existed in the patient case. Similarly, a particular drug tends to coincidently form temporal association with symptoms e.g. fever\ caused by common diseases. Note that symptoms of a potential ADR cannot be differentiated from those of an underlying disease, both of which are encoded using the same ICD-9 codes in electronic health databases. For a drugsymptom pair, the associated symptom is possibly caused either by a drug or by a disease after the drug is started. If both a drug and a symptom have high frequencies in a health database, they can even easily form rechallenge by coincidence. As a result, the obtained causal-leverage value can be high for the pair even though this value does not imply any degree of causality. Therefore, it is necessary to find an exclusion mechanism to reduce the undesirable effects caused by high frequent events \(e.g., either drugs or symptoms Intuitively, if a high frequent event Y randomly occurs after another event X within time period T then it should have the same chance to also occur before X within the same period T among many event sequences. If we use D  and S represent a drug and a symptom, respectively Case1  in Fig. 2 demonstrates a pattern where the symptom S 1  occurs before the drug D 1 within time period T A reasonable explanation of this pattern is that the underlying disease of the symptom S 1 causes the prescription of the drug D 1  Case2  indicates a pattern where the symptom S 1 occurs after the drug D 1 within time period T If we look at Case2 only, a reasonable explanation could be that the symptom S 1  represents a possible ADR caused by the drug D 1 since they exhibit reasonable temporal association. However, if we look at these two patient cases together, it is more likely that the symptom S 1 simply occurs randomly. In this case, both the pair 11  D S and its reversed pair 11  SD exhibit temporal associations in various patient cases. In some cases, the above two patterns can coexist in the same patient case as shown in Case3 For such a pattern, there exist several possible explanations. First D 1 is caused by the first S 1 and the second S 1 occurs coincidently. Second, the second S 1 is caused by D 1 and the first S 1 occurs coincidently. Third S 1  and D 1 simply occur randomly without any causal association. A more realistic patient case can even exhibit a more complex pattern as shown in Case4 It denotes that D 1  has temporal and rechallenge relationship with S 1 since their temporal association occurs twice along the time. However this pattern can be explained differently. For example, the second D 1 occurs after the first S 1 which can be explained as the underlying disease of the symptom causing the prescription of the drug. The temporal association between S 1 and D 1 also occurs twice and they also exhibit rechallenge relationship. Considering all these four types of patterns together, if drugs and/or symptoms occur randomly and frequently, they may falsely form temporal association and rechallenge relationships. However, the number of cases exhibiting these relationships for a drug-symptom and that for its reversed pair \(i.e., symptom-drug\ should be similar Given the above observations, we define a reverse causal-leverage of CAR, denoted as causalleverage  C X Y 
Based on the above definition of the support of a CAR we define an interestingness measure called causal-leverage   causal-leverage  C X Y

Otherwise, if X causes  Y the former should be greater than the latter. On the other hand, if Y causes X then the former should be smaller than the latter. Hence, we define an exclusive causal-leverage  measure as below  exclusive causal-leverage  C X Y 004\004\002  causal-leverage  C X Y 004\004\002  causal-leverage  C X Y 004\004\002  R   supp  C X Y 004\004\002  supp  C X 004\004\002  327 supp  Y 004\004\002   supp  C Y X 004\004\002  supp  C Y 004\004\002  327 supp  X 004\004\002    6   If this measure has a positive value, it denotes that X has causality with Y The bigger the value, the stronger the causal association. If its value is negative, it indicates a reverse causality. Otherwise, a value close to zero is a sign of no causal association between X causes  Y Thus, this measure not only provides a way to quantify the degree of causal association but also excludes undesirable effects caused by high-frequency events that occur randomly C  Mining ADRs from Electronic Health Database Drugs and their associated ADRs have causal relationships. In this subsection, we examine how to search for potential ADRs from an electronic health database given a drug using the above exclusive causal-leverage measure We assume that patient data are stored in a relational database and can be retrieved using database query language In the following discussions, we use the term cases to refer to those patient records containing the drug of interest and non-cases refer to other patient records First, the whole database is searched in order to get all the distinguished ICD-9 codes, each of which represents a symptom or potential ADR. Then the drug of interest forms a pair with each of these symptoms. Each pair stands for a potential CAR whose strength will be evaluated using the  exclusive causal-leverage Next, the existence of each pair is checked within all cases If the number of cases containing a pair is less than 3, the exclusive causal-leverage value for that pair is set as zero. The reason is that, in general, a signal pair generated by an interesting measure is not considered as valid if only one or two cases contain the pair  After desired pairs are determined, each case is searched in order to obtain interested temporal patterns for each pair Cue values for temporal association, rechallenge and dechallenge are derived from these temporal patterns using fuzzy rules. Note that, in order to make our algorithm more generic, the cue other explanations was not utilized in this study since it is drug-dependent. Readers are referred to our previous paper for specific fuzzy rules that were used in this process [1  T h en  th e f u zzy R P D m odel is u s ed t o  ev alu a t e  the degree of causal association for each pair within each case After that, the support and causal-leverage for all drugsymptom pairs are computed Once the causal-leverage value is obtained, we reverse each pair. That is, each pair drug, symptom becomes symptom, drug We then use the above procedure to calculate the reverse causal-leverage value for each pair Finally, the exclusive causal-leverage for each pair is computed by subtracting the reverse causal-leverage value from the normal causal-leverage value. We rank all the pairs in a decreasing order according to their exclusive causalleverage values  The higher the value, the more likely a causal association exists in the pair or CAR  IV  E XPERIMENTS  A  Experiment Data Our experiment data were from Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit, Michigan. De-identified electronic data of all the patients who received at least one of the eight drugs of our interest during the time period from September 4, 2007 to September 16, 2009 were retrieved. The eight drugs include six statin drugs \(i.e., rosuvastatin, atorvastatin fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin\and two ACEI \(angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\ugs \(i.e captopril, and enalapril\. \223Event\224 data such as dispensing of drug  office visits and certain laboratory tests were retrieved for all the patients. For each event certain details were obtained. For example, the data for dispensing of drug include the name of the drug, quantity of the drug dispensed dose of the drug, drug start date, drug schedule, and the number of refills The retrieved data included 16,206 patients. While 15,605\(96.3%\ were male, 601\(3.7%\ere female. Their average age was 68.0. The total number of distinctive ICD-9 codes was 3,954 in the data. Each code represented a potential ADR that might be causally associated with any drug. The drugs enalapril and pravastatin were selected to test the proposed data mining framework. The total number of patients who took these drugs at least once is 1021 and 1383, respectively. Note that multiple drugs might be prescribed for the same patient either at the same date or different dates along time The data were stored in five relational tables in a Microsoft Access database. These tables contained patients\222 demographic data, visit data, diagnostic data, drug-related data, and laboratory data. SQL \(Standard Query Language was used to query the tables and obtain desired information The query results were returned to Java programs that implemented the data mining algorithm. Fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules were implemented using Fuzzyjess a J a va based fuzzy inference engine B  Experiment Results It might be necessary to briefly describe the nature of the ground truth for ADRs before we present our experiment results. For some potential ADRs, there only exist a limited number of reports about their associations with particular

drugs in the literature due to their infrequent nature and the difficulties establishing causal relationships. In many other cases, even if the statistical information is available, it is still hard to say whether a drug is associated with a symptom. For example, the pre-marketing clinical studies for enalapril indicate that the incidence of asthenia for patients who took enalapril and placebo were 1.1 and 0.9, respectively [27 I n  this example, we are not certain whether asthenia is an ADR of enalapril since the number 1.1 is only slightly larger than 0.9. Because of these reasons, it is difficult to establish a clear ground truth for ADRs associated with a drug. In that sense, we will not calculate those metrics \(e.g., false positive rate, recall, etc.\hat need the ground truth. Instead, we will present the top 10 pairs or CARs identified by our algorithm for each of the two selected drugs. The causality of each CAR is collaboratively evaluated by three clinicians in our project team. Please also note that, in post-marketing surveillance, data mining methods are only used to search for potential signals. The results should be interpreted with caution, and if possible, validated with formal clinical studies and/or case reviews For each of the two selected drugs, we computed the exclusive causal-leverage values for all pairs between the drug and each ICD-9 code. We ranked the ICD-9 codes in a decreasing order according to each pair\222s exclusive causalleverage value. The top 10 codes were evaluated by our three physicians on the project team to determine whether they are real ADRs associated with the drug. We also ranked the association between the drug and each ICD-9 code using three other measures causal-leverage traditional leverage without considering causality, and  risk ratio  Risk ratio is defined as the probability that a case coexists with the ICD-9 code relative to the probability that a non-case coexists with the same ICD-9 code. Risk ratio and leverage represent two typical frequency-based interestingness measures. The hazard period was set as T 90 days when causal-leverage  and exclusive  causal-leverage were calculated. The value of this parameter needs to be chosen carefully since if it is too big, some unrelated symptoms would be easier to form false temporal relationships with the drug. If it is too small, real signals may be excluded because some ADRs only happen after a drug has been taken for tens of days. After balancing these two situations, our physicians think 90 would be an appropriate value for this parameter Table III lists the top 10 ICD-9 codes identified by the exclusive causal-leverage measure for drug enalapril. Eight of them were evaluated as real ADRs associated with enalapril. Their ranks in the three other measures are also included in the table. One can see that both risk ratio and leverage cannot effectively rank the eight ADRs high. The table also indicates that the results generated by these two measures are much more similar than those generated by the other two measures. By looking at the ranks of the eight ADRs, the causal-leverage measure obtained much better performance as compared with the risk ratio and leverage measures since it can capture the causal relationship between a pair. Even though the leverage measure obtained comparable or even better ranks for two ADRs \(i.e. 276.7 and 233.7\, it ranked the rest six ADRs as low as around 1000. With capability of reducing the undesirable effects of frequent ICD-9 codes, the exclusive causal-leverage measure achieved the best performance The experiment results for drug pravastatin are given by Table IV. Seven out of the top 10 ICD-9 codes were identified as ADRs by our physicians. One can see that the causal-leverage measure gave higher ranks for all these seven ADRs than both risk ratio and traditional leverage measures. Another interesting observation is that the causalleverage measure classified three out of the seven ADRs into its top 10 list. This implies that this measure does have the potential to discover some ADRs because of its capability in TABLE  III C OMPARING RANKS OF ICD-9 CODES GIVEN DRUG ENALAPRIL UNDER FOUR DIFFERENT INTERESTINGNESS MEASURES   TABLE  IV C OMPARING RANKS OF ICD-9 CODES GIVEN DRUG PRAVASTATIN UNDER FOUR DIFFERENT INTERESTINGNESS MEASURES NOS   N OT O THERWISE S PECIFIED   NEC  226  N OT E LSEWHERE C LASSIFIED

capturing the causal relationship between a drug and a symptom. Consistently, the exclusive causal-leverage  measure also achieved the best performance for drug pravastatin Since the length of hazard period T affects the performance of our exclusive causal-leverage measure, we tested the ranks of three randomly selected known ADRs of drug enalapril when T took different values. The results are shown in Table V. It denotes that both 30 and 150 seem not to be appropriate values for T since some known ADRs was ranked very low. Similar ranks were achieved when T is equal to 60, 90 or 120 days V  C ONCLUSION  We have developed a new interestingness measure exclusive causal-leverage based on an experience-based fuzzy RPD model. This measure can be used to quantify the degree of association of a CAR. Moreover, the measure was designed to mask the undesirable effects caused by highfrequency events. We have applied this measure to detect the causal associations between each of the two drugs \(i.e enalapril and pravastatin\ and its potential ADRs. A data mining algorithm was developed to search a real electronic health database for ADR signals. Experimental results showed that our algorithm can effectively make known ADRs rank high among all symptoms in the database  R EFERENCES   P N T a n  M  S t ei nb ac h  a nd V.

Memory Requirements Evaluation For evaluating the memory requirements of three algorithms, the experiments focus on two aspects 1 We verify the memory requirements of tree construction among three algorithms with different minimum supports in T10I4D100K database. The result is shown in Fig. 11 As shown in Fig. 11, the results are not influenced by different minimum supports because theses algorithms are minimum support value independent. Nevertheless, for constructing T10I4D100K data set, CATS tree spent 15,654KB 


GC tree spent 19,881KB, and SC tree only spent 13,030KB SC tree algorithm saves about 17% and 34% than CATS tree and GC tree Then, we evaluate the influences of different transaction sizes with a fixed minimum support 0.4%. As shown in Fig. 12 we can find that the average constructing space for SC tree saves about 16% and 34% than CATS tree and GC tree 2 In this part, we focus on memory requirements of mining process.

CONCLUSION AND FURTURE WORKS In this paper, a new tree structure called SC tree and a mining algorithm for association rule are proposed. Advantages of several algorithms are combined in this algorithm, and experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm outperforms CATS tree and GC tree mining algorithms For the SC tree algorithm, the mining model \(tree structure does not need to be re-constructed while the minimum support is changed. This property enables users to adjust the minimum support dynamically to find out satisfied large itemsets Because the database is sorted before mining, the SC tree can be mined only from the bottom-up direction, which is quite different from the bi-directional mining in CATS tree and thus the mining time for SC tree is shorter than CATS tree Moreover, the arrangement of sorted transactions is consistent so it is unnecessary for SC tree to adjust the tree structure as in CATS tree. That further improves the efficiency of tree construction in SC tree In addition, the memory requirements for constructing and mining the tree structure of SC tree are also less than both the CATS tree algorithm and the GC tree algorithm. Experimental results show that SC tree algorithm saves 16%~ 34% of memory space Although SC tree algorithm is more efficient than the other approaches, there are still some aspects can be considered for further improvement. One is the process of pre-sorting. When 


the data set is updated, the whole database has to be re-sorted If only partial tree structure rather than the whole tree structure is to be adjusted, execution time can be reduced substantially Another aspect is the scalability. When applying the SC tree algorithm in a large database, employing the technique of parallel and distributed computing can not only lightens the loading of processers and the requirement memory space but also suits for the architecture of disturbed computing environment in enterprises REFFERENCE 1] Peng, Y., Kou, G., Shi, Y., and Chen, Z., A Descriptive Framework for the Field of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery , International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, Vol. 7, Issue: 4, Page 639 - 682, 2008 2] R.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
