This approach combines automatically extracted low-level features from images with high-level knowledge given by a specialist in order to suggest a diagnosis of a new kidney image.  The proposed method distinguishes three kidney categories namely normal, medical renal diseases and cortical cyst.  The preprocessing technique applied on the images eliminates the inconsistent data from the US kidney images. Then feature extraction process is applied to extract the features from the US kidney images. Feature selection and discretization process is done on the extracted features that reduce the mining complexity.  The proposed method uses a new algorithm ARCKi is a new associative classifier This classifies the given image to suggest a diagnosis with high values of accuracy. The performance of our approach is compared with multilayer back propagation network in terms of classifier efficiency with sensibility, specificity and accuracy Keywords:  Association rules, Computer-aided diagnosis data pre-processing, Feature extraction, support of medical diagnoses, US kidney image  I.  INTRODUCTION  Recently, computer-aided diagnosis \(CAD become one of the major research subjects in medical imaging and diagnostic radiology. The basic idea of CAD is to provide a computer output as a secondary observer to 


assist radiologists and other health care professionals in image readings In this paper, we present a method based on association rules to help diagnosing medical images. Our approach has the advantage of selecting only the most relevant features to be used during the mining process Moreover, our approach PreSAGe [1] is optimized because it performs two different operations in a single step feature selection and discretization. This makes the mining algorithm faster, also improving the classification phase. This approach was applied to kidney images and the results show high accuracy The remainder of this paper is structured as follows Section II presents the background needed to understand our method. Section III summarizes related works Section IV presents our proposed method. Section V discusses the experiments and results achieved. Finally SectionVI summarizes the conclusion of this work II. BACKGROUND  The problem of mining association rules was first stated in [1] as follows. Let I= {i1, i2,..,in} be a set of literals called items. A set X  I is called an itemset. Let R be a table with transactions t involving elements that are subsets of  I. An association rule is an expression of the form X  Y, where X and Y are itemsets. X is called body or antecedent of the rule, and Y is called head or consequent of the rule. Let |R| be the number of transactions in relation R. Let |Z| be the total number of occurrences of the itemset Z in transactions of relation R Support and confidence measures \(\(1 2 determine the rules returned by the mining process Support = | XUY| / |R|                 \(1 Confidence = |XUY| / |R|              \(2 The problem of mining association rules, involves finding rules that satisfy the restrictions of minimum support and minimum confidence specified by the user Mining image content demands extraction of the main image features regarding a specific criterion. Image processing algorithms are used to extract such relevant features from the images, organizing them in feature vectors. The feature vectors are then employed in place of 


the images to model them as transactions, which are then used in the mining process. Features quantify intrinsic visual characteristics of the images,  leading to vectors with hundreds or even thousands of elements. Contrary to what one would think, having a large number of features can be a problem. Thus, to avoid decreasing the discrimination accuracy, keeping the number of features as low as possible is important, and this establishes a tradeoff between the discrimination power and the feature vector size  III. RELATED WORK  Brijesh Verma et al. [2] Presented a system based on fuzzy-neural and feature extraction techniques for detecting and diagnosing microcalcifications patterns in digital mammograms. The various feature extraction techniques have been investigated and analyzed. It has been shown that a combination of three features, such as entropy, standard deviation and number of pixels distinguishes a benign microcalcification pattern from malignant appreciably.   In [4] a water immersion method 978-1-4244-5967-4/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE  with the guidance of a domain expert is used to detect objects \(regions of interest of brain images Representative features of the brain images \(gray level area, location, elongation, and direction mining process. Most algorithms used in medical image analysis [6] & [7] are generally based on classification methods. Relevant research that applies association rules for medical image analysis is discussed in this section An automated method for differentiating malignant from benign masses has been suggested in [9]. In this method, 95 mammograms depicting masses in 65 patients were digitized. The features were extracted related to the margin and density of each mass from the neighborhoods of the computer-identified mass regions. Using three automated classifiers, the selected features were merged into an estimated likelihood of malignancy. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic and compared with experienced 


mammographer. A CAD scheme has also been proposed 10] to improve radiologists performance in breast cancer diagnosis. The scheme estimates the likelihood of malignancy for clustered microcalcification based on eight computer-extracted features obtained from mammograms. The comparison was made between the CAD scheme and unaided routine Association    rules    are   used    in    [6]   to   classify mammograms.  First, three features of shape are extracted from each image. A record  combining  the image features    Fig. 1: A CAD system for US Kidney images and the image classification \(benign or malignant generated for each image. The features are discretized in ten equal-sized intervals in order to be applied to an association mining algorithm. The rules are mined with the restriction of not having a classification item in the body part. A new image is classified according to the number of rules matched and the confidence of the rules A drawback of this technique is the discretization process which uses intervals of the same size. This can imply the loss of significant information to mine rules with high confidence. In [8], two types of decision support systems optimized multi-layer back propagation network and hybrid fuzzy-neural system have been developed with these features for classifying the kidney categories. The performance of the hybrid fuzzy-neural system is compared with the optimized multi-layer back propagation network in terms of classification efficiency training and testing time The realization of CAD system for US kidney image is in high demand. An attempt has been made, in the present work, for the first time to implement a CAD system using association rule mining that facilitates automated classification of US kidney images of three categories namely normal \(NR MRD CC the medical experts to perform unbiased diagnosis and to meet few possibilities of CAD system  


IV. PROPOSED WORK  COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF ULTRASOUND KIDNEY IMAGES The CAD system design requires four main areas for its implementation \(a b preprocessing algorithms for segmentation of anatomical structures, \(c d aimed at solving a particular task or application, usually an attempt to detect a specific kind of abnormality [11 This necessitates developing a structured procedure to realize a computer-aided human kidney diagnosis system as shown in the Fig. 1.   It can be noticed that the following sub-division are included in the areas to meet requirements of present application  General processing Image acquisition and digitization Image quality verification and re-acquisition Pre-processing Segmentation of kidney region Image rotation Unbounded pixel elimination Analysis Feature extraction Feature discretization and Selection \(using PreSAGe Algorithm Generating Feature vectors Decision Support System Mining Association Rules Classifying the image using ARCKi algorithm   The images acquired using US scanning system are given as input to the devised CAD system. The purpose of pre-processing,  the acquired image is to retain the pixels of kidney region, so that extracted features describe the tissue characteristics of kidney precisely. The analysis part is to begin with depends on the feature extraction techniques used for obtaining the content descriptive features. The extracted features and class labels are submitted the PreSAGe \(Pre-processing Solution for Association rule Generation  removes irrelevant features from the feature vector and 


gives a discretization of the remaining features. In decision support system, the transaction representations of all the images in the training set are submitted to Apriori algorithm, limiting the minimum confidence to high values to generate association rules. Then a classifier ARCKi is created using the association rules. The feature vector of the test image is submitted to the ARCKi algorithm, which classifies the given image into a particular category  A.  US kidney images The images used for the analysis are acquired from two types of scanning systems namely, ATL HDI 5000 curvilinear probe with transducer frequency of 36 MHz and Wipro GE LOGIC 400 curvilinear probe with transducer frequency of 35 MHz. As the sonographic evaluation is made based on the distribution of echogenity that reflects tissue characteristics, for better echo visualization the longitudinal cross section of kidney is taken to include renal sinus, medulla and cortex regions as suggested by the experts. In total, 150 images with 50 images in each category are obtained from male and female subjects of age 4515 years for training and 78 images with 26 images in each category is acquired under the  same  age group for testing. The images of both right and left kidneys are considered for the analysis. The necessary clinical information of the training images are documented  B.  Kidney diseases The kidney diseases are usually categorized as hereditary, congenital   or acquired.   The most common hereditary disorder is cystic diseases which includes simple renal cyst and complex renal cyst or polycyst [12 13]. The kidneys affected with these diseases are considered under CC category. The sonographic features of renal cyst include a well defined mass lesion, smooth wall and circular hypo echoic mass with good through transmission. Any congenital or acquired  kidney  diseases typically  cause renal  infection and/or destruction of kidney tissues that may  lead  to  end  stage chronic  renal failure are considered under MRD category. Due to tissue 


destruction, anatomical separation between renal sinus medulla and cortex becomes difficult. The sonographic evaluation    shows   hyper   echoic kidney region with increased cortical echogenity and differentiation between cortex and collecting system is poor  C. Pre-processing of US kidney image  The pre-processing procedure prior to feature extraction must be formulated such that the sonographic information of kidney region is preserved. Hence care must taken to ascertain, no alteration occur in the spatial gray level distribution of kidney region. The preprocessing procedure that concerns above requirement involved three steps, are image segmentation, image rotation and unbounded pixel elimination Segmentation is a fundamental process for higher level medical image analysis. For the present CAD system realization, i-HSIC segmentation scheme [14] has been used for contouring the kidney region of different kidney categories. This scheme is preferred as mentioned it provides a general solution for contouring.  In the acquired image, kidney may geometrically be viewed as elliptic. The visual inspection confirms that the major axis makes an angle  \(called as angle of inclination respect to the horizontal or reference axis and it varies anywhere between 0 to 180 Before feature extraction, the images are rotated along the horizontal axis to ensure =0 for maintaining uniformity in image representation and avoiding influence of varied orientation on features. The estimation of major axis orientation and angle of inclination  is made by using the contour co-ordinates of i-HSIC. Followed by the segmentation and rotation, it becomes necessary to eliminate the superfluous echoes that lie outside the kidney region to make the features content descriptive The pixels enclosed by the contour are considered to be POI or bounded pixel and pixels that lies outside the contour are regarded as unbounded or noise pixels Discarding the unbounded pixels results in a preprocessed image I\(x, y Further analytical details on pre-processing procedure and 


explanations may be referred in [15  C.  Feature Extraction  The features of texture proposed in [16] are extracted from images and organized into feature vectors. To perform the extraction, a co-occurrence matrix of the analyzed image is generated. A co-occurrence matrix M\(d of two gray-level pixels and , separated by pixels in the orientation. First, the gray levels of the images are reduced to 16. Co-occurrence matrices are calculated for the directions of 0, 45, 90, and 135 and for the distances 1 2, 3, 4, and 5. Twenty matrices of 16 X 16 integer elements per image are produced. For each matrix, the following seven features are calculated, producing a feature vector of 140 elements to represent each image Step          =    i j P \(i, j 3 Variance =    i j \(i-j i, j 4   Entropy    =    i j P \(i, j P \(i, j 5 Energy     =    i j P \(i, j 6 Homogeneity = i j P \(i-j 1+|i-j 7 3o Moment     = i j\(i-j i, j 8 Inverse Variance = i j P \(i-j i-j 9  D. ARCKi \(Generation of Association Rules with High Confidence for Kidney images ARCKi is well-suited to generate suggestions for diagnoses. This section presented our proposed method The knowledge of specialists should also be considered during the processing of mining medical images in order to validate the results. The extracted features of the test image and the feature vector generated can be submitted to the classifier, which uses the association rules and generates set of keywords to compose the diagnosis of a test image. Algorithm for ARCKi is given below  Input: Feature vector F of the test image, threshold Output: set of keywords S Method

An item set h is returned in the suggested diagnosis if the condition is satisfied as the given equation  nM\(x 10 nM\(x x  techniques that are applied in the training phase like preprocessing and feature extraction are also applied for the new test image. The images of the test set and the association rules generated were submitted to ARCKi algorithm with  = 0.001.

E.  Performance evaluation criteria We use the measures of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed method in suggesting diagnoses of US kidney images The measures are described in \(\(11 13 outcomes of a two class prediction be represented as True positive \(TP TN FP False Negative \(FN are correctly classified as True Positive and True Negative respectively. A False Positive is when the outcome is incorrectly classified as positive\(yes negative\(no classification process.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The dataset consists of 150 images with 50 images in each category are obtained from male and female subjects of age 4515 years for training and 78 images with 26 images in each category is acquired under the same age group for testing. The images of both right and left kidneys are considered for the analysis. The dataset was divided in two parts: the training set that is composed of 60 images \(40% of dataset composed of 90 images \(60% of dataset training set kidney image features are extracted and they are applied to PreSAGe algorithm, with parameters minperint = 6, mintofuse = 0.8 and valreduct = 17% which are tuning parameters set by the user. PreSAGe selects 24 features as the most relevant ones, obtaining a reduction of 83% in  the feature   vector  size. Then  feature vector is formed for the selected features and association rules are generated by using Apriori algorithm. The value of minimum  confidence was  set to 99% and  minimum support was set to  10%.  In  the  test  phase  the  new  test image   that  has  to be  diagnosed  is  taken  and   also  the NR MRD

Rangayyan Mammographic information analysis through association-rule mining, in Proc. IEEE CCGEI 2004 2004, pp. 14951498 In this paper we presented a method, which is based on association rules, to generate suggestions for diagnosis of medical images, and which can be integrated into a CAD. Our approach is divided into four main steps general processing techniques, preprocessing algorithms for segmentation of anatomical structures, analysis and Decision support system. The third step uses an algorithm called PreSAGe, which executes two tasks in a single step: feature selection and discretization. The feature 


selection process speeds up and reduces the complexity of the whole method, making it faster than traditional approaches. The last step is performed by the ARCKi algorithm, which generates a suggested diagnosis to a test image. The result of the proposed method is compared with multilayer back propagation network\(MBPN terms of classifier efficiency with sensibility, specificity and accuracy. The results show that the proposed method achieves high sensitivity \(up to 94 up to 93 input images are quantified by numerical value it is possible to, create a universal reference for all three categories, make comparative study on values obtained to decide on category and know the extent of pathology involved. It is also believed the proposed CAD system may assist the physician to predict future possibility of normal subject becoming abnormal based on feature value.

BU-UFM Utility threshold=5  Figure 5.  Utility frequent patterns mining on T40I10D100K V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we introduce a utility frequent pattern mining model based on a share strategy to find the combination of items with high frequencies and utilities. This model first find all patterns with a given minimum support threshold. In this step, a share strategy gives a way to share most of the results from the previous mining process instead of separating them distinctively, thereby dramatically reducing the cost of computation. And then all patterns that do not satisfy a minimum utility threshold are pruned The extension of our technique, for maintenance of the already mined utility frequent patterns when updating databases, is an interesting topic for future research REFERENCES 1] R.

the time needed for execution exceeded 100000 seconds Thus, from this analysis we see that FPrep, which uses FCM clustering, clearly outperforms the CLARANS and CURE based methods on the basis of speed. The execution times for CLARANS and CURE mentioned in fig. 7 and Table II do not include the time required to create fuzzy sets, and calculate the membership value  for each numerical data point in every fuzzy set for the numerical attribute under consideration. These times also do not take into account the time required to transform crisp numerical attributes to fuzzy attributes, and derive the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset The fuzzy partitions generated for each of the five numerical attributes for the USCensus1990raw dataset are shown in Table III. Coincidentally, generating three fuzzy partitions for each numerical attribute seemed a perfect fit In addition to the superior speeds achieved by FPrep, as illustrated in fig. 7 and Table II, Table III indicates the semantics and the quality of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. Moreover, the number of frequent itemsets generated by a fuzzy ARM algorithm \(like fuzzy ARMOR and fuzzy Apriori minimum support threshold, is illustrated in fig. 8   Fig. 7. Algorithm, numerical attribute comparison based on speed \(log10 seconds   Fig. 8. Number of frequent itemsets for various minimum support values  B. Results from Second Dataset We have also applied FPrep on the FAM95 dataset http://www.stat.ucla.edu/data/fpp transactions. Of the 23 attributes in the dataset, we have used the first 18, of which six are quantitative and the rest are binary. For each of the six quantitative attributes, we have generated fuzzy partitions using FPrep. A thorough analysis with respect to execution times, has already been performed on the USCensus1990raw dataset \(which is manifolds bigger in size than the FAM95 dataset both on the basis of number of transactions and number of unique values for numerical 


attributes dataset has been done solely to provide further evidence of the quality and semantics of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. The details of the same are in Table IV. In this case, the number of fuzzy partitions is different for different numerical attributes. Thus, the number and type of fuzzy partitions to be generated is totally dependent on the attribute under consideration. A graphical representation of the fuzzy partitions generated for the attribute Age has already been provided in fig. 5, and clearly shows the Gaussian nature of the fuzzy partitions. The nature and shapes of fuzzy partitions for the rest of the attributes are also similar. Last, the number of frequent itemsets generated for different minimum support values is illustrated in fig. 8  C. Analysis of Results With FPrep, we can analyze and zero in on the number and type of partitions required based on the semantics of the numerical attributes, which the methods detailed in [19 20] do not necessarily facilitate. Then, FPrep, backed by FCM clustering, takes care of the creating the fuzzy partitions, especially assigning membership values for each numerical data point in each fuzzy partition. In section 8.A we have already shown that FPrep is nearly 9 to 44 times faster than the CURE-based method, and 2672 to 13005 times faster than the CLARANS-based method. FPrep is not only much faster than other related methods, but also generates very high quality fuzzy partitions \(Table III and IV much user-intervention. We have created a standard way of representing any fuzzy dataset \(converted from any type of crisp dataset efficacy of the same is corroborated by the successful implementation of Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR on the fuzzy dataset \(converted from crisp version of FAM95 dataset an initial implementation of Fuzzy ARMOR, are very encouraging. FPrep, when used in conjunction with these fuzzy ARM algorithms, generates a pretty good number of high-quality frequent itemsets \(fig. 8 frequent itemsets generated for a particular minimum support is same, irrespective of the fuzzy ARM algorithm 


used IX. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have highlighted our methodology, called FPrep, for ARM in a fuzzy scenario. FPrep is meant for seamlessly and holistically transforming a crisp dataset into a fuzzy dataset such that it can drive a subsequent fuzzy ARM process.

This methodology involves two distinct steps, namely creation of appropriate fuzzy partitions using fuzzy clustering and creation of fuzzy records, using these partitions, to get the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset FPrep has been compared with other such techniques, and has been found to better on the basis of speed. We also illustrate its efficacy on the basis of quality of fuzzy partitions generated and the number of itemsets mined by a fuzzy ARM algorithm which is preceded by FPrep. This preprocessing technique provides us with a standard method of fuzzy data \(record that it is useful for any kind of fuzzy ARM algorithm irrespective of how the algorithm works. Furthermore, this pre-processing methodology has been adequately tested with two disparate fuzzy ARM algorithms, Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR, and would also work fine with other fuzzy ARM algorithm REFERENCES 1] Zadeh, L.

The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
