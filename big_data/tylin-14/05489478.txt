INTRODUCTION Data Mining \(DM extracts its useful knowledge from a lot of incomplete, random information that has been generated from the production marketing, customer services of the enterprise, and then through the analysis of data to find the information and knowledge within the data. With the extensive use of databases, the application domains of data mining also become more and more extensive. Because of the realization of industrial automation, the business domain has generated a mass of business data, of which there is little truly valuable information.Therefore, it can enhance enterprises competitiveness to do in-depth analysis in the mass of the data and to acquire the truly valuable information that is conducive to business operations and the business decision-making. The main feature of data mining is executing extraction transformation, analysis, and other models of treatment to the abundant business data in the commercial databases, to extract the critical data that can assist the business decisions II. THE COMMON DATA MINING METHODS USED IN CRM Data mining is a process of discovering knowledge It is mainly based on the statistics, the artificial intelligence, the information science and other technologies, and analyzes the data in a highly automated way,   makes the inductive reasoning from which to excavate the potential models, and to predict future events. In this way, the data mining 


can       assist the decision-makers to assess risks and make the right decisions. \(Figure1 Figure 1 the evolutionary process from data to the knowledge In practical applications, data mining mainly adopts the following methods A.   The Association Analysist To learn more about association rules mining, firstly, it should meet the support degree and the confidence level.  The support degree reflects that there is enough data may support this rule, the confidence level reflects the credibility of this rule.  The association analysis is analyzing the intimate degree of relations among the variables,     and it mainly based on observational data to establish the appropriate dependency relationship among the variables. The association rule can find out the relations among different commodities in the database then it come to reflect the customers purchasing habits. This rule is one of the methods that are applied quite extensively at present B.   The Time Series Analysis Being similar to the association analysis, the time series analysis is also aimed at digging out the relations among the data, but it is more focused on the causality of data in chronological sequence.  As a retailer's example, it is the time series analysis if the data mining system divides into groups according to the customer number   rather than the transaction number in the analysis, and further classifies each group by time. By utilizing the time series to analyze customers purchasing records, the retailers can find out the potential purchasing patterns of customers C.    The Classification Analysis Firstly, the classification analysis endows every observation with a tag, and then checks these marked observations, describes their characteristics. This kind of description may be a mathematical formula or a model, which can be used to categorize the new observations.  Several usual typical classification models include the linear regression model, the decision tree models, the rule-based model and the neural network model.  For example, based on the debt level income level and working conditions, it can carry out credit risk analysis to the given customers. The classification analysis will give out the predicted results through estimating the relation between the above properties and the degree of risk in 


the known data D.  The Cluster Analysis The process that a set of objects are grouped into multiple classes consisting of similar objects is called clustering.  The objects, which are grouped into the same class are similar to each other, while the objects in the different classes are distinct.  The cluster analysis has being widely applied?For example, in the business, the clustering can group the customer information through customer data, and describe the customers purchasing patterns; in the biological by classifying the gene-sequence, it can find that which kind of feature or symptom will be led by the specific genes combination The data The data warehouse Data mining  The Solutions of intelligent data analysis Data Manageme Knowledge Discovery Second International Conference on Computer Research and Development 978-0-7695-4043-6/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/ICCRD.2010.184 822 III. THE BASIC STEPS OF DATA MINING Under the premise that the target of data mining is explicit based on the established enterprise-level customer-information data warehouse, it can carry out the data mining work.  Data mining should keep to the following steps: to confirm the objective of analysis and forecasting, to establish the data mining database, to analyze the data, to establish the model, to evaluate and validate the model, to implement the model and several other basic steps.  \(Figure 2   Figure 2  


To confirm the objective of analysis and forecasting is the basic condition of data mining. Only confirming the objective of analysis can we extract the data and select the methods.  The implementation process of data mining is also carried out around this objective.  For example, the objective of data mining is to find the high-value customers. Whether it can accurately find the high-value customers according to the rules of data mining, which has been mentioned, has become the most important criterion of the mining model Creating a data warehouse is regard as the object of the data mining and analysis. To the collected data, it should record in a detailed way about the source of data, the size, the storage location and the limitations in the application of data After finishing the collection of data, it is necessary to describe the data. For instance, in the data, which properties are included, the total number of records, the names of properties the number of incomplete records and which properties is missing in these incomplete records, etc. In this way, it can make the characteristics and regularity of the data in the data warehouse to be more notable In the process of data analysis, it can show the characteristics of the searched data through multi-dimensional analysis and visualization; and then, through the operation of the additions and deletions to data or several new variables recombined and generated by the existing variables, it can describe the data characteristics more effectively.  In a word analyzing the statistical characteristics of data plays an important role in the data analysis process To establish the model is a process that selects appropriate methods and algorithms for data analysis to get a data-mining model.  It is necessary to choose the right methods and algorithms when it establishes the model.  In fact, modeling is a repeated process, and it needs to improve or replace the algorithms continually to find the model which obvious effect on the objective analysis, at last it will get a reasonable and most appropriate model The main work in the checking-model phase is to substitute the testing data into the built model, and then to observe the response of the model. By comparing the model response with the real data, it comes to assess the accuracy of the model.  If the accuracy of the model is relatively poor, we should reexplore the data to create a new model, until checking the new 


model.  Thus, in the practical applications, data analysis, model building and model testing is an iterative process IV. THE APPLICATION OF DATA MINING IN THE CRM In the CRM, the premise of data mining is that it is necessary to establish the enterprise-level customerinformation data warehouse, which can assemble the customer data in different OLAP, and can    provide a correct, complete and single customer-data circumstance. As the basis for data mining, the data warehouse possesses the subject-oriented integrated, non-renewable as well as time-varying characteristics. Regarded as the original data source of the data warehouse, every OLAP system provides the customers' basic information, the customer lists, the customer bills, the history records of customer contacts and other data in the form of documents. The data warehouse, through the ETL process extracting, transforming and loading interface files, and will organize, store and manage the customer data according to different themes domains. At last through the interface of data warehouse, it can carry out the online analysis and data mining to the customer data in the data warehouse.  After completing the establishment of enterpriselevel customer-information data warehouse, you can proceed the data mining based on this platform, and apply it into different areas and stages of the customer-centric enterprises decision-making analysis and management A.   The group classification of customers Classifying customers is conducive to the customer analysis for different types of customers, and then it can institute customer service strategies respectively.  Data mining can divide a large number of customers into different categories;   the customers in each category have similar attributes, while the attributes of customers in different categories are also different with each other. Through data mining, we can understand the tastes of different customers and provide targeted products and services to improve the satisfaction of different kinds of customers to the enterprise and its products.  For example, in the long-term financial services, the bank has accumulated a large amount of data information including the history of customer service, the sales history and income to the customers, as well as the customers demographic data and lifestyle, etc.   In the customer database To confirm the objective of 


analysis and forecasting To establish the data mining database To analyze the data To establish the model  To evaluate and validate the model To implement the model To revise the model 823 of the bank, a large number of customers may have very high similarity in depositing, loaning or utilizing other financial services. In this way, it forms the customer groups owning commonness.  Through the classification analysis, we can find out their commonness, provide them targeted services, and thus to guide their investment behaviors and to enhance the bank's comprehensive service level, as well as to achieve more benefits. Customer classification can also be carried out on the customers' consuming behavior analysis. It will be more customized to mine the post-classification data; in this way, the enterprise can offer different product contents for the customers with different behavior patterns B.   The customers acquisition and maintaining analysis The growth and development of the enterprise need to maintain old customers and to acquire new customers constantly. New customers include the people who had never heard of our enterprise products previously; the people who did not need our products before ; as well as the people who had been the customers of our competitors previously. No matter which kind of customers the enterprise requires, data mining can help it to identify these potential customer groups increase the response rate of market activities and finally to enable the enterprise to know exactly what to do and shoot the arrow at the target.  Since the enterprise doesnt know much about the information of new customers, it should take some necessary means to obtain information on potential customers The information should include the address, age, income range occupation, educational level and buying habits.  After acquiring the related information, by observing the potential customers reaction to its   products, the enterprise can establish the data-mining predictive models according to 


feedback, and find the products in what the customers show the most interest. The mining results will show a list of potential customers; at the same time, it can analyze which kind of people most likely potential customers is, according to the analysis of potential customer information. After getting these outcomes, the enterprise will have the leading direction when it is searching for the potential customers Customer retention is a process to keep old customers and to prevent them from losing.  In this process, we should first analyze the data of the customers whom we have lost, to find the behavior patterns of these customers, and to analyze the reasons for losing customers. Based on the characteristics of these losing customers, the enterprise should promptly adjust service strategies towards them, and act appropriately to retain customers according to the characteristics of customers which are got from classifying the customers. Customer retention is an extremely important part in the customer relationship management C.   The analysis of customer loyalty The analysis of customer loyalty mainly analyzes the customer durability, immobility and stability. The durability of customers reflects customers continuous consumption in the enterprise. Then, the immobility of customers reflects the degree that the customers are affected by various factors Moreover, what the customers stability reflects is the customers consumption cycle and frequency. The customer who purchases products of the enterprise at short intervals,    is considered as being stable.  For example, by carrying out data mining to the customers VIP card information, we can record the customers ' buying sequence and group the goods that a customer has purchased at different times and in different marketing activities into sequences. The data mining of sequential patterns can be used to analyze customers purchasing trends and thus to distinguish the customers loyalty. At the same time, it can predict changes of customers loyalty. According to all of these, the enterprise can adjust and update the price, the types of goods, as well as their marketing strategies to retain the existing customers and attract new customers. The analysis of customers durability, immobility and stability mainly take advantage of the trend analysis approach in the time series models.  Trend analysis consists of the analysis about several aspects, like trending, cycle trend 


and changes, seasonal trend and changes, irregular random trend.  According to the trend analysis, the enterprise can understand customers consumption trends over past a period Combining the analysis results and predicting results of data we can estimate a customer's durability, immobility and stability, and then determine the customers loyalty D.   The Cross-Selling Analysis Cross selling refers to the process that the enterprise sells the new products or services to the existing customers. The advantage of cross selling is that, for the existing customers the enterprise can easily get relatively abundant information about them, which contributes to the accuracy of data mining However, in most cases, the referred cross-selling is different from the initial sale. In the customer information which is hold by the enterprise, particularly in the information of previous purchasing behaviors, it may include the key factor or even the determining factor that will decide this customer next purchasing behavior : that is, it can help the enterprise to find these factors which will affect customers buying behaviors E.  The customer profitability analysis The customer profitability is an indicator for the quantitative evaluation of customer value.  It is a process that based on the prescriptive evaluation scale, it gets a definitive result through calculating the customer data. Therefore, the calculation of customer profitability does not need data mining However, by utilizing the data mining technology, the enterprise can predict the changes of customer profitability in different market competition environment and market activity environment.  The customer profitability analysis is intended to find those "high-value customers, and to proceed deeper and more detailed customer relationship management towards them.  In the analysis of customer profitability, the data mining application is aimed at finding out the most suitable market environment, so that the enterprise   customer profitability can be optimal CONCLUSION In the information age, the enterprise should make full use of its information resources, and change the product-centric management model into the customer-centric management model. Moreover, it also should focus on the collection of customer information; establish the customer-data warehouse utilize the data mining technology and analyze features of 


customers to provide the enterprise with decision-making 824 supports in the marketing, production and operations, and to improve the corporate performance continuously REFERENCES 1]   Zhu Ming, Data Mining.

Also, there is a strong dependency between mothers being smoking or not during pregnancy and the mental health of her kids.  By going through most of the generated rules, we could find that the results are consistent with the latest medical research findings. In addition to that we have found that some of the rules are completely nontrivial, such as that rule that states that there is  a relationship between not having dogs or cats in household and the effect on the kid  being shy when meeting friends VI. CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have discussed the problem of the high volume of medical data to be read by physicians, the accuracy rate that tends to decrease, and automatic reading of data that becomes highly desirable. Various association mining techniques have been considered.  Of those techniques, we have chosen AprioriTid algorithm as the basic association mining technique. It is been implemented as the core of our medical mining system. The system has been implemented and used against the data of the National Center for Health Statistics \(NCHS Prevention \(CDC disseminated and analyzed on the health status of U.S citizens. The outcomes of collection and analyses are made available through different data release mechanisms including

In our experimental phase, we have used a minimum support value of 1%, and minimum confidence equals to 70%. From the generated association rules that we have found some interesting rules that can be used in the early prediction of health problems ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors wish to thank the research center in the college of computer and information science, King Saud University for funding this work REFERENCES 1] N.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
