Research on Semi-automatic Domain Ontology Construction Zhang Dan, Zhang Li, Jiang Hao School of Computer and Engineering, Southeast University Nanjing, China ynkmzhd@126.com AbstractOntology as an important knowledge representation tool is widely used in many fields. The most popular way to construct domain ontology is by manual. However constructing domain ontology is a lengthy and costly thing Research on construction of domain ontology is becoming increasingly widespread in computer science community. In this paper, an approach to semi-automatically constructing domain ontology based on Chinese word partition and data mining is proposed. The method is proved to be effective and also assures the quality of the ontology at a certain level Keywords-domain ontology; generalized suffix tree K-Means clustering algorithm; association rule I. INTRODUCTION Ontology as a concept representation can describe concepts and the relations among them in the semantic layer It has been widely used ever since it was proposed. However it is a both lengthy and hard thing to construct domain ontology by full manual, which limits the spread of ontology application. Ontology learning shows enormous significance and value in theory and practice. How to construct domain ontology fast has become a hot research topic II. RELATED WORK A. Brief Introduction of Ontology Ontology is originally a philosophical concept which explains the real world systematically. In the computer science, artificial intelligence first brought it in. Gruber gave the most popular definition of ontology an explicit specification of the concept model in 1993[1]. Later Studer made the further study and defined ontology as formal and explicit specifications of the shared concept model [2 Generally speaking, ontology is a concept model used to describe the concepts and the relations among them B. The Framework of Semi-automatic Domain Ontology System The semi-automatic domain ontology system designed in this paper mainly consists of three parts: the extraction 


module of domain concepts and the extraction module of taxonomy and non-taxonomy relations among domain concepts. Statistical analysis method, generalized suffix tree and clustering method and association rule mining method are respectively adopted in the above three parts. The system framework is illustrated in Figure. 1[3  Figure 1.  The system framework III. AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF DOMAIN CONCEPTS A. Framework of Extracting Domain Concepts The framework of extracting domain concepts is illustrated in Figure.2  Figure 2.  The framework of extracting domain concepts Supported by the Nature Science Foundation of JiangSu province of China \(NO.BK2008354 2010 Seventh Web Information Systems and Applications Conference 978-0-7695-4193-8/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/WISA.2010.41 115  B. Extraction of Compound Words First the corpus is segmented into words that exist in the common words dictionary. Word segment algorithm contains machinery matching algorithm and understanding type syncopation. Currently many kinds of open-source software can be used for the segmentation of Chinese. In this paper ICTCLAS \(Chinese Lexical Analysis System developed by Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science tool The steps of extracting compound words can be divided into four steps Step1: Segment the corpus text into words, and then determine the scope of words. For example, for one text C in the corpus, it can be expressed as ncccC ,,, 21 L=  after segmented; in which ic  represents a word Step2: Partition the segmented text by inserting separators. Numbers, special symbols, Chinese virtual characters and blank lines all can be used as separators. For example, partitioned text C can be expressed as njjii cccccccC ,,/,,,/,,,,, 1121 LLL 


Step3: Construct the candidate list of compound words from the corpus text obtained in step2. According to the statistic analysis of Chinese corpus, the length of compound words is generally less than five words. For the segmented corpus, the average length of the words is 1.6. So the structure of compound words like 2-gram 3-gram or 4-gram \(that means compound words are composed by two, three or four words first part c1, c2, c3, c4 of the text C, the candidate compound words are: c1c2, c2c3, c3c4, clc2c3, c2c3c4 clc2c3c4. 2-gram parts are: c1c2, c2c3, 3c4, 3-gram parts are: clc2c3, c2c3c4, and 4-gram parts are: clc2c3c4 Step4: Determine whether there is a high degree of relativity among the candidate compound words, and then derive the complete compound words C.  The Parameters of Domain Concept Extraction There are mainly three parameters used to judge the validity of the compound words a   the degree of relativity between two strings a, b in statistical language model. The formula of mutual information is as follows             abfbfaf abf abpbpap abpMIab ?+=?+=    \(1 b  integrity of a word combination. It contains left and right context dependency c  domain concepts. TF-IDF \(term frequencyinverse document frequency of words IV. AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF THE RELATIONS AMONG THE DOMAIN CONCEPTS The relations among domain concepts have two types taxonomy and non-taxonomy [7]. The concepts in ontology are generally composed of domain keywords. Domain 


keywords have two types: \(1 non-existed words in the dictionary; \(2 namely the existed words in the dictionary, can be obtained immediately from the segmented text A. Extraction of Taxonomy Relation based on Generalized Suffix Tree A generalized suffix tree [8] is such a suffix tree that contains all the suffixes of the string set },,{ 1 nss L . The method based on generalized suffix tree is described as follows Input: The list of concepts ConceptList, supposing the length of the list is n Output: Concepts that have the same suffix Step1: Construct a generalized suffix tree Step2: Traverse the generalized suffix tree and record the list that consists of all the leaves of the tree. Name the list LeafNodeList. Traverse the leaves in the LeafNodeList If the identifier in the leaf node is larger than 1, the content of the leaf node is the desired suffix Step3: Obtain the longest suffix from concept words with the same suffix B. Extraction of Taxonomy Relation based on Clustering If two words are always used in the similar context, the two words are the same kind. So taxonomy relation can be 116  extracted through clustering. The context of a word is expressed by the vector in the word space 1 Word space model is a multi-dimensional vector space model constructed by obtaining the statistical information of the corpus. Each vector in the space represents a domain concept. The vector in the word space is constructed with 4-grams in the context The concrete steps of constructing word space are as follows Step1: Read all the domain concepts obtained in the concept extraction module, and establish word list of domain concept. Name the list ConceptList. Suppose the number of concept in ConceptList is n Step2: For the qth \( nq ,,2,1 L ConceptList, construct its context vector representation 


When w is in the ith position, the vector is expressed as is 4-gram of iw  and ijaaa L,, 21  are separately the occurrence number of ijggg L,, 21 . The number of chosen 4-gram can be specified as parameters by users Step3: In all the positions vector representation. Finally, add all the context vectors can obtain the vector representation of w   wpi iq wW . All the vectors of concept words constitute vector space. Repeat step 2 and 3 on each concept word in ConceptList, then the word space  C  can be obtained and represented as },,{ 21 nWWWC L 2 Concepts Here cosine law is adopted to calculate similarity    21 , WWsim between vector  1W and  2W         


21 21 22  2121 ,cos WbWa WbWa ba ab WWWWsim 2 Cosine law in essence is using the geometry angles cosine between vector  1W  and  2W . Larger the distance of two vectors is, smaller the cosine value is; on the contrary the similarity is lower 3 Initial Optimization Center based on "Min-Max" Principle Here K-Means clustering algorithm based on the min-max" principle was adopted to choose initial centers The "min-max" principle can ensure the distance between the initial centers far enough. Firstly choose two domain concepts with the minimum similarity from the similarity matrix as the initial centers. Secondly for each non-center domain concept, obtain the ones which have the maximum similarity with the existed centers. Finally choose the domain concepts with the minimum similarity from those maximum similarities as new centers. Suppose the number of chosen centers is m, then recurrence formula of the m+1 2,1],,,2,1 max{min[ mjmixxd ij LL ?=      \(3 According to the rule that the distance between adjacent centers should grow stable, then determine mutation point k. The number of centers should be less than the square of the number of clustering data, that means nk < . The concept center depth is calculated as the following  min min min min idistidistidistidistiDepth ?++??=   \(4 The center domain concepts prior to the max Depth\(i chosen as center, and the following ones become non- center 


K-Means clustering algorithm is as the follows Step1: Divide the non- center domain concepts into the clusters of nearest center Step2: Choose new centers from the clusters where similarity of domain concepts must exceed the appointed value Repeat step1, 2 until the obtained centers or cluster set become stable C. Extraction of Non-taxonomy Relations Compared to the extraction of taxonomy relations, the extraction of non-taxonomy is more difficult. Extracting the related concept pairs is the key. The method based on association rules mining is adopted to extract related concept pairs. The algorithm of extracting related concept pairs is as follows Output: the set of related concept pairs 117  Step1: Construct a concept pair set by gathering every two different concepts Step2: For each concept pair in the set, calculate the support and the confidence based on association rules mining algorithm If both support and confidence satisfy MinSup and MinConf, the concept pair is related; else the pair must be deleted V. IMPLEMETATION OF A SEMI-AUTOMATIC DOMAIN ONTOLOGY CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM This section mainly shows the operation of each module in this system A. Implemetation of Domain Concepts Extraction Module Users can check the selected concept words and then delete the illegal ones in this interface. The output is compound and common words. The interface of concept extraction module is shown in Figure.3  Figure 3.  The interface of concept extraction module B. Implemetation of Taxonomy Relations Extraction Module An example is shown in Figure. 4. The left edit box is the set of edited domain concepts, which are the data source of the taxonomy and non-taxonomy relations extraction module 


The three boxes in the middle, respectively implement extraction of taxonomy relation based on clustering and generalized suffix tree and extraction of non-taxonomy relations based on association rules mining. The right edit box shows the extraction results  Figure 4.  Example of extraction of relations among domain concepts VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Nowadays it is also quite difficult to construct a common and mature tool used for constructing ontology semi-automatically.

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
