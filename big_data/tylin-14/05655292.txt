Prediction of E-shoppers Behavior Changes Based on Purchase Sequences  Liu Jian Wang Chong Library  Business School Huaihai Institute of Technology Huaihai Institute of Technology Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China wangchongwang0916@yahoo.com.cn hitchongwang@sina.com  Abstractwith the rapid development of online shopping, on-line one-to-one marketing becomes a great assistance to e-shoppers. One of the most important marketing resources is the prior daily transaction records in the database. In this study, the paper  propose a new methodology for predict e-shoppers purchase behavior that uses e-shoppers purchase sequences. First, transaction clustering is conducted, then it is made that detecting the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes, and the e-shoppers behaviors which are derived from a change in the cluster number of each e-shopper, are kept in the purchase sequence database. Finally sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. The sequential purchase patterns are then stored in the association rule database. The better result is achieved by applying the new methodogy to a given example for e-shoppers Keywords-e-shopper, purchase sequence, behavior change I.  INTRODUCTION The development of the Internet has caused a new wave of business revolutions. Most of the Electronic Commerce businesses endeavor to survive and become leaders in the frontier of the new wave. The major key factors [1] of success include learning e-shoppers purchase behavior, developing marketing strategies to create new consuming markets, and discovering latent loyal e-shoppers etc. Therefore, support of domain expertise to make better decisions and new IT techniques to promote EC marketing are essential E-retailing companies operate purchase databases in a longitudinal way, such that all transactions are stored in chronological order[2]. A record-of-transaction database typically contains the transaction date and the products bought in the course of a given transaction. Usually, each record also contains a e-shopper ID, particularly when the purchase was made using a credit card or a frequent-buyer card. Therefore the purchasing sequence of a e-shopper in the database who 


has made repeat purchases can easily be determined [3-5]. This purchase sequence provides a description of the changes in a e-shoppers preferences over time So far, several methods have been proposed for predicting e-shoppers behavior. Statistical methods, such as regression model and ARMA [6], have been the candidates for decision makers. However, these methods are only efficient for data which are seasonal or cyclical. Association rules extraction can discover potentially significant patterns and rules underlying the database. The patterns and rules are mostly the habits of purchasing and other e-shoppers' behavior. However there are many shortcomings [7-8] for the algorithms in the efficiency. In the existing algorithms for discovering the association rules, the support is unique throughout the whole database [9], and they assume that each data included in the database occurs in a similar frequency [10]. However e-shoppers in e-retailing business are not static, and their buying behavior changes over time [11]. Therefore, association rules extraction is not suitable for predicting the changes of e-shoppers purchase behavior for only mining the transaction data during a certain period Though artificial neural networks which are better than the conventional statistical methods [12] have been recently employed, the problem still arises [13]. Most ANN models use a multiplayer network with one or more hidden layers. The parameters of the model such as the choice of input nodes number of hidden layers, number of hidden nodes \(in each hidden layer dependent problem and often require trial and error to find the best model for a particular application [14-15 Purchase sequences can reveals the changes of e-shoppers preferences over time. However, in the present domain of knowledge, there has been little study of mining the e-shoppers behavior based on purchase sequences. In this study, for predicting e-shoppers behavior changes, we propose a new methodology that considers the way in which a e-shoppers purchase sequence evolves over time In the following sections, literature review is briefly introduced in Section 1. In section 2, we elaborate the idea of the proposed methodology. In section 3, we present the algorithms for predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior. In section 4, an illustrative example is given to illustrate how to 


utilize the method. Finally, discussions and conclusions are presented in Section 5 II.  DESCRIBING METHODOLOGY To predict e-shoppers purchase behavior changes, an organizations management first identifies target e-shoppers who share similar preferences for products and looks for those products that target e-shoppers are most likely to purchase The purchase transaction records of e-shopper are used to build e-shoppers profile describing his or her likes and dislikes. A set of e-shoppers known as neighbors who have exhibited similar behavior in the past, can be found through calculating the correlations among e-shoppers. A 2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence 978-0-7695-4225-6/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/AICI.2010.271 152 neighborhood size of e-shoppers is formed according to the degree of similarity between each of the neighbors and a target e-shopper. Once a neighborhood is formed for a target e-shopper, a set of the products that the target e-shopper is most likely to purchase is determined by searching for products that the neighbors have purchased and that the target e-shopper has not yet purchased. To illustrate the method mentioned above, let us consider the following example Table 1 presents typical transaction records for an e-retailing company and the e-shopper profile is provided in Table 2 TABLE I.

0 0  0 0  This example determines products that target e-shopper ID011 is likely to buy, using transaction records for e-shoppers CID006 through CID016. Target e-shoppers purchase behavior can be predicted according to the correlation of preferences between the target e-shopper and the other e-shoppers. All of the four e-shoppers, CID016 CID006, CID007 and CID008, commonly bought Candy and Can. The similarities between CID016 and the other three e-shoppers are equivalent. The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.67. Therefore, it is sure that CID006, CID007 and CID008 are the nearest neighbors and have the same preferences as the target e-shopper According to Table 1, a e-shopper profile is rearranged with regard to each e-shoppers transaction time. The result is shown in table 3. From table 3, it can be seen that the purchase sequence of the target e-shopper CID016 occurred in the order of Candy, followed by Can Products. Similarly, the purchase sequences of CID006, CID007 and CID008 were Candy?Can?Milk, Candy?Can?Bread, Can?Candy?Milk respectively. Assume now that the neighbors of the target e-shopper are determined based on the purchase sequence of each e-shopper. E-shoppers who have purchase sequences similar to that of CID016 include CID 006 and CID007. The purchase sequences of CID016 and CID006 are exactly same as both bought the same products during the same month therefore, the nearest neighbor of the target e-shopper CID016 is CID006. The next nearest neighbor is CID007. Therefore the products which CID016 is likely to buy are Dresses, and Shoes. As mentioned above, when the past purchase sequences of each e-shopper are available, this knowledge can be used to predict e-shoppers purchase behavior However, if a e-shopper profile rearranged by time is applied  directly, this application results in a significant problem, namely, the sparsity problem. Rearrangement of an input matrix by time results in an increased time dimension as compared to that of a typical e-shopper profile. In this 


study, a clustering and SOM technique is employed. All the transactions of e-shoppers may be allocated to a certain cluster and a cluster number imposed. The change in the cluster number resulting from each transaction determines a e-shopper purchase sequence. By observing changes in the cluster number of each e-shopper over time, a buying sequence can be built for each e-shopper. These buying sequences are potentially capable of predicting the future purchases of a target e-shoppe TABLE III. PROFILE REARRANGED BY TIME  III.

First, transaction clustering is conducted, so that all the transactions of e-shoppers are clustered. The SOM technique is used to cluster target e-shoppers transactions Then it is necessary to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. These e-shopper behaviors, which are derived from a change in the cluster number of each e-shopper, are kept in the purchase sequence database. Finally sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. The sequential purchase patterns are then stored in the association rule database Although SOM technique can obtains transaction clusters SOM clustering technique often breaks down when handling very high-dimensional data. So it is proposed that using product classes represents the hierarchical relationships among products. The method can make an effective dimensionality reduction while improving clustering results Assume that a product class set P  is classified into n different subclasses, and that each subclass consists of subclasses at a lower level, or eventual leaf products, as follows PPPPP nn ,, 121 ?= "                          \(1 Suppose that C is the set of the transactions of m e-shoppers during s periods before timeT . More specifically letC be composed as follows CCC kTmkTkTC ???= ,,2,1 ,, "                   \(2 11,0 ?= sk "  2?s WhereC kTj ?, ?C  is a non-empty subset of products Each C kTj ?,  represents the product class or classes from which e-shopper j purchased products at time kT EveryC kTj ?,  is transformed into an input matrix composed of a bit vector, and the matrix to be transformed is used in the transaction clustering. The time-ordered vectors for a particular e-shopper represent the purchasing history of the 


e-shopper; this input matrix can be thought of as the dynamic profile of the e-shopper. A dynamic e-shopper profile is defined as follows Let C _ be a dynamic e-shopper profile. Then, C _ is defined by the following matrix for n product classes and m e-shoppers over the course of s periods  3 mj "2,1 11,0 ?= sk " 2?s Where                         1 if Pi?C kTj   All the transactions of e-shoppers in the training e-shopper purchase database are transformed into dynamic e-shopper profiles based on their prior purchase behaviors. Then we use the SOM clustering technique to assign each transaction to a group. This transaction clustering facilitates the discovery of the dynamic cluster sequence of e-shopper The transaction clustering results in the following set of q clusters DDDD q"21 ,=                             \(4 Where each Di is a subset of C _ the given in \(3 A rearrangement of these clusters by  e-shopper  and by time  period is necessary for the identification of the dynamic behavior of each e-shopper. It is possible to learn the cluster sequence of a e-shopper by identifying the cluster to which each transaction of the e-shopper belongs, during each time period. To formalize this concept, we use the following terminology Let BP j be the behavior pattern of e-shopper j . Then, the behavior pattern BPi is identical to the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper j during s periods and is defined as follows  5 Where D kTj ?, ?D ,11,0 ?= sk "  2?s The  process  of searching for  a behavior path can 


be simply conducted through transaction clustering. All e-shoppers  have  a behavior path based on their prior transactions. The association rule technique is well suited for determining the most frequent pattern with confidence, since it provides automatic filtering capabilities. To discover the behavior path of a target e-shopper at time T based on his/her past behavior, the input data should be divided into a conditional part and a consequential part. Association rules are descriptive patterns of the form X?Y, where X and Y are statements regarding the values of attributes of an instance in a database. X is termed the left-hand-side, and is the conditional part of an association rule. Meanwhile, Y is called the right-hand-side, and is the consequent part. The conditional part is composed of the left-hand-side assigned to the consequential part R j represents the association rule about the user specified minimum support and confidence in the following form R j 6 A rule R j  indicates that, if the path of a e-shopper is DD TjsTj 1,1, , ?+? " , then the behavior cluster for that e-shopper is D Tj, at timeT It is necessary to know the degree to which the behavior path of a target e-shopper during 1?s periods beforeT  is similar to the association rule. The cluster path of a target e-shopper, transformed via the SOM, is compared with the association rules derived from other e-shoppers paths, and then the best-matching path is determined. Execution of this 0 if Otherwise    C kTj 154 process requires new measures for calculating the degree of correspondence between the association rules and the behavior path of a target e-shopper. This similarity measure is defined as follows     


1 1  s i i kTj i j SSD                            \(7 Where        1 if RD kTikTi   Si kTj 0 otherwise mj "2,1 11,0 ?= sk " 2?s ni "2,1 The above definition indicates that, if the behavior path of a target e-shopper i is equal to the conditional part of association rule j in the same period, then S j kTi ?,  is equal to one, otherwise is equal to zero. However, even if the similarity measure is high, a choice of the association rule suited to the prediction of the cluster of a target e-shopper at timeT is difficult, since such a rule is not general, given that the support and confidence of the association rule may be remarkably low. Therefore, to assure a good fit between the behavior path of a target e-shopper and the conditional part of the association rule, it is necessary to measure fitness. Fitness is defined as follows Suppose FDij be a degree of the goodness-of-fit between the behavior path i and the association rule j . Then, FDij is defined as follows ConfidenceSupportSDFD jjjiij = ,             \(8 Using the above definition, we can determine the cluster of a target e-shopper at timeT is a consequential part R Tj, of the association rule j with maximum FDij IV.  ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE In this paper, we use Table 3 as example given to illustrate proposed method. The set of product classes given in Table 3 is P={Candy, Can, Milk, Bread, Biscuit}. The transactions of e-shopper CID006 are C June,006 {Candy}, =C May,006 {Can}, =C July,006 {Milk 


Therefore, the dynamic purchase profile of CID006 buying the set of products {Candy, Can, Milk Bread, Biscuit} from May to July may be represented as { }0,0,0,0,1,006 _ C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,006 _ C May and 0,0,1,0,0,006 _ C July . CID016 and CID006 are exactly same as both bought the same products during the same month Therefore, similarly, the transactions of target e-shopper CID016 are =C June,016 {Candy} and =C May,016 {Can The dynamic purchase profile of CID016 buying the products may be represented as 0,0,0,0,1,016 _ C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,016 _ C May TABLE IV.

The association rules are as shown in table 5. The similarities  between the path of e-shopper CID016  and the derived rules are 22016 =SD and 11016 =SD . Therefore, e-shopper CID016 belongs to the ninth cluster at timeT , since the fitness between CID016 and the rules are =FD2016 0.2 and =FD 1 016 0.2001. Therefore, we predict that the products which e-shopper CID016 is likely to buy are Bread, and Biscuit  TABLE V.

In this study, we describe a new approach for mining the changes of e-shopper  purchase behavior over time and discuss solutions to several problems. For predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior, the following concepts are proposed: BP j SDij and FDij . The SOM technique is used to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. The purchase sequences are derived from the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper. The sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. Then the sequential purchase patterns are stored in the rule database Finally, we give the example to elaborate the new methodology. The research presented in this paper makes a 155 contribution to mining  e-shoppers purchase behavior basing on transaction data. E-retailer may be able to perform effective  one-to-one marketing campaigns by providing individual target e-shoppers with personalized Product basing on using purchase sequences In the future, some possible extensions to this work are as 


follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
