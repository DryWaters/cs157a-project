A big challenge for recommending infrequently purchased products is the lack of data about users interests. Web log data is an important data resource to derive useful information about users navigation patterns which in turn can help find users information needs. In this paper, a novel method Closed Sequence-Sequence Generator Mining \(CSGM generate closed sequences and sequence generators for nonredundant sequential rule mining. By applying the proposed method on web logs, we can extract sequential associations among products which reflect users preference on products. We have conducted experiments on recommending cars based on users interests generated by utilizing the sequential rules extracted using our method. Our experiments show that by using those rules we can find users interests more accurately and thus improve the quality of car recommendation compared to the standard matching-based car search. Moreover, by only using the non-redundant rules, the same or even better recommendations can be generated than using the whole set of rules Index TermsRecommender system,closed sequence, sequence 


generator, non-redundant sequential rule mining I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, recommender systems can introduce user items and products that are matching users preferences or interests 1]. However, most of the recommender systems are developed for recommending frequently purchased products such as DVDs, books, and movies. Moreover, many of the recommender systems are developed using collaborative filtering which is heavily based on users ratings to products. But for infrequently purchased products, users rating data is very limited as the products are not often purchased by the users during their lifetime, and users are not able to provide ratings for products that they never use. Thus the commonly used recommendation techniques are not suitable for recommending infrequently purchased products. Currently most of the available online systems for recommending infrequently purchased products like cars and houses are matching-based search engines, whereby the systems retrieve products that match exactly with the users query. This query is normally short and does not reflect the user requirements fully. Therefore, a recommender system that can predict users preferences from the initial input given by the users is needed for recommending infrequently purchased products. Recently, web usage mining techniques have been widely investigated and applied for web page recommendation. The acquired knowledge from web usage mining provides valuable information for predicting the access behavior of users that can be used by recommender systems for recommending infrequently products We have proposed a knowledge-based recommender system which utilizes opinion mining and rough set association rule mining to extract associations between product attributes from user review data [2].In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate non-redundant sequential rules from sequential datasets. By applying the proposed method on web logs, we can extract sequential associations among products which are viewed or visited by users when they are navigating the web site for products. These associations reflect users preferences towards products. In this paper, we propose to expand users profiles by using the extracted rules with the hope to more accurately find users interests and thus generate more accurate recommendations The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 is a 


summary of related research works. Section 3 describes the definitions and terminologies and details of our approach Section 4 discusses the experiment and performance. We summarized our study in Section 5 II. RELATED WORK Recently, some researchers have proposed recommender system which utilizes sequential rules or sequential patterns. In the paper [3], the author considers the evolution of customers purchase sequences over a period of time in order to improve the quality of traditional collaborative filtering system. The proposed system involves two phases: In the model building phase, the SOM \(self organizing map group transactions based on similarity between users purchase history [3] , the clustered transactions are then transformed into a sequence of transaction clusters, mainly represent customers behavior locus. After that, sequential cluster rules are generated by time-based association rule mining method [4 in the recommendation phase, the best matching locus of a 2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology 978-0-7695-4191-4/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.253 292 target customer is determined by comparing the cluster locus and the purchase sequence rules Paper [5] developed CSB-mine algorithm for efficient sequential pattern mining from web log data, the CSB-mine algorithm was based directly on the conditional sequence bases of each frequent event which eliminates the time and space cost for constructing intermediate pattern trees, the CSB-mine algorithm was latterly applied into a web personalized recommender systems which predict the pages may be accessed by current user However, methods from [3] require each users purchase behaviour over a period of time, which is not available for recommender systems of infrequent purchased products Methods introduced in [5] are only limited to recommending webpages or links , which are not directly related to products recommendation. In contrast, our approach adapts nonredundant sequential association rule mining method which is totally different from the methods in [3-5]. In addition we conduct non-redundant sequential rule mining on users 


navigation history \(web access sequences using rules for recommendation purpose, we use rules to expand users initial queries for user profiling. The following section will discuss the proposed approach in detail III. APPROACHES For those online e-commerce websites for infrequently purchased products, because of lacking enough user feedback or input information, the hidden information stored in web logs could be considered as another important resource for user profiling.By using web usage mining techniques, we can build user access sessions, and transfer the web page of each session into corresponding products according to its content By using the extracted patterns and sequential rules from these sessions, we can predict the users preferred products The proposed approach contains two main processes: 1 Non-redundant sequential association rule mining to generate quality sequential rules from the user navigation histories 2 navigation history sequential rules In this section, we define some useful concepts and entities used in this paper A. Definitions Definition 1 \(Frequent closed sequences and Sequence generators sequence if there exists no sequence s such that \(1 and \(2 s s generator if there exists no sequence s such that \(1 and \(2 s s From Definitions , we can see that the minimal generator of a closed sequence is the minimal subsequence of the closed sequence whose closure is the closed sequence. Also any generator of a closed sequence has the same support as the closed sequence Definition 2 \(Redundant Sequential Association Rules Let X ? Y and X ? ? Y ? be two sequential rules with confidence cf and cf, respectively. X ? Y is said a redundant rule to X ? ? Y ? if X ? X ?, Y ? Y ?, and cf ? cf For example, among the four rules: \(1 cf 2/3 2 cf = 2/3 3 cf = 2/3 4 cf = 1 1 2 3 4 1 4 2 


and \(3 rule \(4 with small antecedent but large consequent B. Non-redundant sequential rule mining A non-redundant sequential mining method is adapted to extract valuable information from the user navigation sessions generated by web usage mining technique \(we omit the details due to the page limit ing field, N.Pasquier [6] defined a condensed representation for association rules; the representation was characterized by frequent closed itemsets and their generators. And the research aimed to present rules with minimal antecedent and maximal consequent. This technique can remove significant amount of redundant association rules to help improve the quality of the mining result. We propose to extend the [6] nonredundant association rule method to sequential rule mining area. Our aim here is to represent non redundant sequential association rules with minimal antecedent \(sequential pattern and maximal consequent \(sequential pattern 1 non-redundant sequential rules are generated from the frequent closed sequences and the sequential generators discovered. In each closed sequence \(considered as a sequence closure use the sequential generators as antecedents, for each generator, we discover its consequent in the form of removing the same prefix parts from closed sequence which the generator has, the remaining part of this closed sequence is considered as the correspondent consequent . The following two bases define the non-redundant sequential association rules generated based on closed sequential patterns and sequential generators Definition 3 \(Sequential Min-Max exact basis ClosedSeq be the set of closed sequential patterns, and for each closed sequential pattern cs, lets denote Gencs the set of sequential generators of cs. The sequential min-max exact basis is SeqMinMaxExact = {r : gs ? \(cs/gs gs ? Gencs ? gs 6= cs Definition 4 \(Sequential Min-Max approximate basis we denote GenSeq the set of sequential generators of the sequential closed patterns in Closed, the min-max approximate basis is SeqMinMaxApprox = {r : gs ? \(cs/gs 


gs ? GenSeq ? SeqClosure\(gs 2 CSGM: One important task is to generate both closed sequences and sequential generators. CloSpan [7] is an algorithm 293 to generate closed sequences, but this algorithm does not generate sequence generators. Genminer introduced in [8] is a sequence generator mining algorithm, however, it does not extract the closed sequential patterns. Both of these methods require a separate algorithm to find either generators or closed sequences. In this paper we propose CSGM \(Closed sequence and sequence generator mining tends the CloSpan mining method. Our method can produce both sequence generators and closed sequences at once. The method first scans the database once, finds all frequent length1 sequences\(each pattern only contains 1-item generators of length-1 sequences are themselves, we put these sequences and a set of their corresponding generators together as sequence-generators pairs. Each sequence-generators pair s, sg Algorithm 2. CSGM will then recursively call the CGSPan method until all the closed sequences which have the same prefix s in \(s, sg discovered. Details of the algorithms are shown in Algorithm 1,2 and 3 Algorithm 1 CSGM \(D, min sup, L Input: a database D, and min sup Output: The complete closed sequence set L 1: Remove infrequent and empty sequences from D 2: S1 ? a set of all sequence-generator pairs of \(s, sg s is a frequent 1-item sequence 3: For each sequence-generator pair\(s, sg 4: Do CGSpan \(\(s, sg 5: Eliminate non-closed sequences from L Algorithm 2 CGSpan \(\(s, sg Input: A sequence s, sg is the set of minimal generators of s, a projected database Ds, and min sup Output: The prefix search lattice L 1: Check whether a discovered sequence s? exists such that either s? ? s or s ? s and database size Size\(Ds D?s 2: IF such super-pattern or sub-pattern exists then

Query Expansion A users query Q is represented by a set of terms Q q1, q2, ...qn} that user provides to the search engine. In the product search, the terms in the query are attribute values of the product that the user is looking for. For searching products online using a product search engine, a user needs to provide the search engine with a query which consists of the products or product attributes which the user is interested in. The query, generally, is very short and insufficient to present the users actual preferences or needs. In this paper we propose to expand users query by using association rules among products. The query expansion aims to improve the initial users query in order to retrieve more products that might fit the users needs Let Q = {q1, q2, ...qn} be the query sent by a user to the search engine. For each q in Q, q is a product or a product attribute. If q is a product, by using the sequential 


rules which have q as the antecedent, we can derive more products which are given in the consequent of the rules. These derived products can be added to the query. The rationale of using sequential rules to expand user query is based on the interpretation to the associations. The association between the antecedent and the consequent of a rule indicates that the consequent could happen if the antecedent happens. Therefore the derived products which are in the consequent of a rule could be interested by the user if the user has showed his interested to the product in the antecedent of the rule IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION A case study was conducted for an on-line car selling domain. We conducted experiments on a dataset collected from this website. The dataset includes a set of 947153 web server log records involving 3119 types of cars From the log data, we generated 153491 sessions from which 124769 sequential rules were extracted including 57906 non-redundant rules \(with absolute support set to 260 minimum support was set to 260 to 300\(absolute minimum confidence is set to 50%. We evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of generating non-redundant rules and the effectiveness of using the rules to improve recommendation quality We compared our CSGM based non-redundant sequential rule mining method with the Prefix-Span[9] based full sequential rule mining method. The full sequential rules were extracted from full frequent sequential patterns which generated by Prefix-Span algorithm. We recorded the running time and extracted rules numbers of both algorithms with variety 294 Fig. 1. rules numbers and time cost comparation: varies support but with same confidence =50 Fig. 2. recommendation effectiveness for full rules and non redundant rules minimum support but same minimum confidence settings \(at 50 The results showed that non-redundant rule mining method had great improvements both in running time and compactness of mined rules to the full sequential rules mining method. The rule set size could be significantly reduced by using non-redundant rule mining, the average reduction ratio could achieve to 66%. In addition, non-redundant rule mining method were running much more efficient than the full rule 


mining one, especially in the case of using lower minimum support setting In another aspect, we evaluated recommendation improvement of our proposed approach by comparing the recommendation results with and without initial query expansion User session records which contained sequences of products patterns this stage. For the query expansion method, each session line were splitted into two parts, the first product of each session were chosen for initial query expansion to get the TOP-N recommender results, rest of them were considered as the user interested products. For the method without query expansion, the first product was directly used to get the TOPN recommender results. We record the matched products between the TOP-N \(N=10,20,30,40 and 50 and user interested products for both methods, and calculated average recalls and precisions in left part of figure 2. We found that using non-redundant sequential rules for query expansion during input stage would have a higher recall and precision We also conducted an experiment by using both nonredundant and full sequential rules for initial query expanding The result in right part of figure 2 showed that using nonredundant sequential rules to expanding query has the same or even slightly better recommendation effectiveness than using full frequent sequential rules. Since the cost of generating full frequent sequential rules is far more expensive than producing the non-redundant sequential rules. We consider it is more efficient using non-redundant sequential rules in information retrieval, and those large amount of removed redundant rules will not cause information loss problem V. CONCLUSION We have proposed a method which could extract nonredundant sequential rules for users initial query expansion Our work first aims to reduce the redundant sequential rules in the way of mining sequential rules from closed sequential patterns and sequential generators instead of frequent sequential patterns. The method performs significant redundancy and time-cost reduction. During the recommendation effectiveness test, we found that by using sequential rules of user navigation history for initial query expansion could improve the recommendation results and using non-redundant did not cause any information loss. In addition, we believe that some redundancy 


still exists in our method. Further redundancy eliminating will be considered in our future work ACKNOWLEDGMENT This paper was partially supported by the Smart Serveices CRC project \(Cooperative Research Centres, Australia REFERENCES 1] J.B.

Rules extracted from the second experiment where the associations between SNP genotypes and populations are identified. The M and m refer to major and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively  Previous studies on genetic structures of ethnic groups reached a similar conclusion. Rosenberg et al conducted clustering analysis using SNP data clustering 52 peoples into 6 clusters [11]. Each cluster belongs to one of the following: Africa Europe+Middle East+Central/South Asia, East Asia Oceania, America and Kalash population. Under this scheme, Europe, Middle East and Asia populations constitute one cluster. A similar result was observed also in our study. For example, in the left part of the 


dendrogram, Asian and European populations are shown to share the same branch. In the middle part American populations share a branch. And in the right  2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_people part, Africa populations share one branch and Central/South Asia populations share another Next, the class association rule mining was tested The resulting frequent SNP groups of subject populations further revealed the frequent SNP sets unique to some population groups. Some of the results are shown in Table 1. Table 1 depicts top scoring rules up to three returned less than three rules that exceed our quality constraints. We used 0.3 for both Rule Confidence and Population Support. In the end, 3,779 rules were drawn out. Under each rule, M indicates the major allele of the relevant SNP locus, while m refers to the minor allele of the locus. Most of the rules are 3-SNP rules with the 5-SNP rule being the longest. Each rules weight is computed through the following ;  9  9 A?BCDCEFG=@@EAHAIHCE<=>?@A?BCDCEFJG=@@EAHAIHCE    \(11  A SNP constituting a rule with high scores usually shows a high frequency of its minor allele in the corresponding population. For instance, with regard to genotypes rs1553533 and rs1553554, one of the two genotypes is found overwhelmingly more often than the other in Surui population. Other than this information, however, no studies have been conducted on the relations between populations and the SNPs extracted in the rules In order to work around this problem, we examined the association between SNPs and traits in a coarser level. In this experiment, we examined the association between the SNPs and the geographical regions. In our dataset, multiple populations are mapped to a geographical region. The results are shown in Table 2 We also used 0.3 for both Rule Confidence and Population Support for this experiment. The rules 


found in this experiment retain F-scores lower than those in Table 1 This outcome seems to stem from the increased heterogeneity of the individuals in the same class \(i.e., geographical region KLMNOPQRSTTU  V9 suggests that rs256871 SNP has some relation with Asian populations. Our literature survey discovered an association between them such that rs256871 SNP is part of SEPT8 gene, and, in turn the SEPT8 gene is known to be accountable for tuberculosis among Asians [12 Nonetheless, most of the rules found in this study were difficult to interpret, because, out of more than 660,000 SNPs used in the study, very small numbers of such SNPs had been subject to research for  3 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218008T 4 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218014Q 322 determining the relations with particular traits such as population and geographical region.

Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
