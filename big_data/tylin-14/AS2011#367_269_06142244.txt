penetration of information, thus to a large extent is advantageous to the promotion of knowledge innovation. This paper analyzes the network structure of the alliance network among Chinese enterprises, and through the association rules mines and then analyzes the impact that the network structure of innovation alliance network has on the innovation performance of 156 firms in the network. The experimental results show that suitable network structure has a positive impact on enterprise innovation Keywords- Innovation alliance;Association rule;Betweenness Centrality;Local efficiency I  I NTRODUCTION  Social network structure influences the dissemination of information, penetration of knowledge, and then affects the 
innovation ability. In the formation of inter-firm innovation network relations, scholars paid more sustained attention for strategic alliance [1 erp r i s e i n n o v a ti o n  n e tw ork ha s become an important engine of knowledge creation and innovatio 3  an d i t pr o m o t es inter f ir m  ass o c iat ion  knowledge exchange and cooperation in information as well as other resources creation  A l l iance ac tivit ies b e t w ee n  enterprises have produced a strong coordination and diffusion effect on enhancing innovative activities and promoting industrial upgrading This paper intends to test the relationship between network structure and the innovative capacity of the network 
In addition, this article will extract association rules among network structure, innovation ability and other variables, and thus provide the guidance variables of structure level for the enterprise innovation This paper studies the innovation network from two perspectives. On the one hand the paper studies the influence of network constitutive target on innovation ability, and then mines the association rules. The second section carries on the review of correlative theories. The third introduces our method. The fourth gives the analytical results. The fifth extracts the association rules in the innovation network. The final section gives the summary and discussion to the article

Table 3 and Table 4 show that all the rules have a confidence over 0.92, and the metric of acc is greater than 0.99, thus learned that there is strong connection relationship between different network variables. In other words, any a group of features have the similar function to describe network structure, and we can choose one of them to consider its impact on business innovation, and then eliminate the redundant rules in the next step Table 5 the association rules between network attributes and patents Rule# Antecedence Consequence Confide nce convicti on lift 1 Local efficiency\(0.813,1 Patent1\(0,101 1 8.02 1.12 2 Centralization\(2151.866\ Patent1\(0,101 1 6.4 1.12 3 Pre-patents\(0,6\atent1\(0,101\0.98 3.77 1.1 4 Centralization\(0,842.137 Local efficiency\(0.813,1 Patent1\(0,101 4.45 1.12 5 Local efficiency\(0.813,1 Patent2\(0,226 0.99 1.43 1.03 6 Local efficiency\(0.813,1 Patent3\(0,226 0.99 1.67 1.03 7 Network density\(0,0.039 Patent2\(0,226 0.97 10.32 2.73 8 Local efficiency\(0.844,1 Betweenness centrality\(0,4.917 Pantent3\(0,226\ 0.99 2.15 1.05 9 Bppl\(0,1.2\bcc\(0.373,inf\ Pantent2\(0,226 0.97 7.46 1.51 10 Local efficiency\(0,0.25 Pre-patents\(0,6 0.93 1.27 1.04 The rules given in table 5 all have a high confidence to 0.97, and the conviction is also above 1.4. Take rule 1 for example, as the confidence and conviction of it are far higher than the scheduled threshold, it can be explained that the appearing of the local efficiency \(0.8125, 1\patent1 0,102\t the same time is not accidental, and the local efficiency of innovation network has a significant positive impact on the innovative capability of the enterprise in the network. That is to say, the more obvious the local efficiency of innovation network, the more patents the enterprises approved lag for a year V CONCLUSION In this article some new characteristics of the enterprise innovation alliance network have been given. Through the analysis of the association rules between the enterprise innovation alliance network's characteristic and the number of the enterprise patent applications, we get that network structure can promote the enterprise in innovation alliance to obtain more patents When founding the alliance, the enterprise should consider the position distribution of the industrial colony Being too dispersed causes the enterprise to cooperate invariably, but overly being centralized can lead to information redundancy, which makes it difficult to get fresh abundant information. Therefore the policy-maker should simultaneously consider these two kinds of situations in order to facilitate the innovation of the alliance network A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by three projects of National Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 60975033 71003069\hai Leading Academic Discipline Project J50103\, and Research Funds Projects of Public Welfare Industry from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China \(201105033; Basic Scientific Research Project Of International Centre for Bamboo Rattan, No 1632009006  R EFERENCES  1 Gula ti  R. a n d H  Singh   The Archi te cture o f  C o ope ra tion:Ma n a ging Coordination Costs and Appropriation Concerns in Strategic Alliances."

multivate Gaussians. First, the historical data is used to construct the initial representation of the Probability Density Function \(PDF answer queries can be answered using the model. The model is updated as new observations are obtained from the sensor network, and as time passes. There are various different models that may be more suitable in different environments and for different classes of queries As more and more data streaming applications emerge proper data estimation algorithms for streaming data are needed. In [13], the authors proposed using pattern discovery in multiple time-series to estimate missing data but it's not well suited for sensor networks, where the relationships between sensors are decided not only by the time trends, but also by some other factors, like locations and so on. In [6], the authors proposed the Window Association Rule Mining \(WARM estimating missing sensor data. WARM uses a modified Apriori Algorithm for association rule mining to identify sensors that report the same data for a number of times in a sliding window, called related sensors, and then estimates the missing data from a sensor by using the data reported by its related sensors. WARM has been reported to perform better than the mean substitution approach where the average value reported by all sensors in the window is used for estimation. However, there exist some limitations in WARM. First, it is based on 2-frequent itemsets modified Apriori association rule mining algorithm, which means it can discover relationships only between two sensors and ignores the cases where missing values are related with multiple sensors. Second, it fmds those relationships only when both sensors report the same value and ignores the cases where missing values can be estimated by the relationships between sensors that report different values V5-103 2010 2nd International Conference on Education Technology and Computer \(ICETC In view of the above challenges, we develop a technique to perform missing data estimation based on the post mining association rule sets between multiple sensor readings, in which data missing by a sensor is estimated using the data generated by its related sensors III. POST MINING OF NON-REDUNDANT ASSOCIATION 


RULES FOR SENSOR DATA ESTMATION In this section, we describe the notations and defmitions that are used in the proposed technique. Also we present the post mining non-redundant association rule technique and use it to perform missing data estimation in the wireless sensor network applications A. Preliminary Concepts In this subsection, we describe the notations and defmitions that are used in the proposed technique. Let I i h i2, ... , in} be a set of n items. A subset X ? I is called an itemset. A k-subset is called a k-itemset. Each transaction t is a set of items from 1. Given a set of transactions T, the support of an itemset X is the percentage of transactions that contain X. A frequent itemset is an itemset the support of which is above or equal to a user-specified support threshold Let T and X be subsets of all the transactions and items appearing in a data stream S, respectively. The concept of a closed itemset is based on the two following functions andg:j\(1 X E X, i E t}. Function/returns the set of itemsets included in all the transactions belonging to T, while function g returns the set of transactions containing a given itemset X An itemset X is said to be closed if and only if C\(X j{g\(X X is called Galois operator or closure operator [16 Let D = {db d2, ... , dn} be a set of n item identifiers, and V= {Vb V2,     , vm} be a set ofm item values. An itemJ is a combination of D and V, denoted as J= D.V. For example dn.vm means that an item with identifier dn has the value Vm An association rule is an expression X s,c and Y are interesting itemsets, and X n Y = <p. The parameter s represents the support of the rule which is the percentage of records that contain both X and Y in the database \(s = s\(Xuy Xuy percentage of records containing X that also contain Y called the confidence of the rule \(c = s\(XuY X Ig\(Xu y X association rules, the support and confidence of which are above or equal to a user-specified minimum support and confidence, respectively [1].

Post Mining o/Non-redundant Association Rules /or Sensor Data Estiamtion In this subsection, we describe our proposed technique for post mining of non-redundant association rules for sensor data estimation purpose. This algorithm is developed based on non-redundant informative association rules which means all rules cannot be derived from other rules and the left hand side and right hand side of the selected rules contain the input itemset. There are some research works that can generate the closed itemsets and corresponding association rules using generated closed itemsets [3 , 18 Based on our previous works [8] we assume to have the non-redundant association rules ready and the criteria of selecting the rules from non-redundant rules further reduce the number of rules to the minimum In this algorithm, dn.vm is treated as one item in association rules. Dn represents the sensor which is indexed as n. Vm represents the value of the sensor n is read as m. In the following figure, Xinput is the itemset represent the current round of sensor readings, it can be represented by a set of dn.vm pairs. Xl and X2 are the itemsets in left hand side and right hand side of association rules. Z represents all items in X2/Xinput. Index\(z z and value of sensor value pair z. Confidence{Xl=>X represents the confidence of the rule Xl=>X2 Support\(Xl=>X2 C represents the confidence of association rule, dn V represents the identifier and value pair of the sensor dn Xestimate represents the returned estimation itemset which contains the senor identifiers with missing values in the current round of readings of stream data and their corresponding estimated values. Sspecify represents the user specified support, and Cspecify represents the user-specified confidence The algorithm is described as below. The input of the procedure Estimate includes the current round of sensor reading, current association rule confidence, user-specified minimum support and user-specified minimum confidence 


In line 4, all association rules that satisfy with the conditions of minimum support and confidence are selected The confidence of the select association rules are calculated in line 5. The condition of line 6 filters out the rules whose left hand side itemset Xl does not contain the itemset Xinput in this case, sensor identifier is filtered based on the enriched contextual information. The condition of line 7 filters out the rules whose right hand side itemset X2 does not contain new estimated items. Each new item was processed in line 8 and 9 so that missing sensor values are V5-104 2010 2nd International Conference on Education Technology and Computer \(ICETC modified and updated. At the end of this procedure, an iterative call of the same procedure keep on searching and processing for the new association rules that are able to make contribution on the sensor value estimation Input: \( 1 contains missing values 2 3 Output: Xestimste: a set containing the senor ids with missing values in the current round of sensor readings and their corresponding estimated values Method 1 Xestirnste = <\\l 2 Cinput=l 3 Procedure Estimate\(XinpUb Cinpub Sspecify, Cspecify 4 for all \(rule: X,=>X2 and Support\(X,=>X2 Confidence\(X,=>X2 5 C = Conjidence\(X,=>X2 6 if \(X,EAinput 7 if\(X2\\Xinput*<\\l 8 for all \(ZEX2\\Xinput and zE Xestimste 9 Xestimste = Xestimste U z 10 n = index\(z 1 1  d., v= dn v +C*value\(z 12 end for 13 end if 14 Estimate\(X2, C, Sspecify, Cspecify 15 end if 16 end for 17 end procedure 


Figure 1. The post mining of non-redundant association rule for sensor data estimation IV. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY The performance of our proposed approach is studied by means of simulation. Several different simulation experiments are conducted in order to evaluate the proposed technique and compare it with the Average Window Size A WS linear trend approach, and with the WARM approach, the state-of-the-art data estimation algorithm in sensor databases using 2-frequent itemsets based association mining [6]. We compared the estimation accuracy, running time and memory space usage when applying different methods to the application dataset The dataset was collected in year 2000 at various locations throughout the city of Austin, Texas. The data represents the current location, the time interval, and the number of vehicles detected during this interval. All sensor nodes report to a single server. The sensors are deployed on city streets, collect and store the number of the vehicles detected for a given time interval. The vehicle counts taken as sensor readings that are used as input for our simulation experiments are traffic data provided by [2 A. Performance Study of Estimation Accuracy The evaluation of the estimation accuracy of the missing values is done by using the average Root Mean Square Error RMSE I'\(xa, -Xe 1 ___ l __ lI_?''? ____ _ numStates # estimations where Xa; and Xe; are the actual value and the estimated value, respectively; #estimations is the number of estimations performed in a simulation run; and numStates is the number of subsets, in which the actual readings are distributed The expression u  xa, -Xe estimations error and is an estimate of the standard deviation under the assumption that the errors in the estimated values \(i.e. Xai Xei 


see the smaller the RMSE, the better the estimation accuracy From Figure 2, we can see that the proposed technique gives the best average estimation result of the above approaches regarding the accuracy, followed by the WARM approach.

Performance Study of Memory Usage Figure 4 illustrates the memory usage of A WS, linear interpolation, linear trend, WARM and proposed approaches in MB. The experimental results show that in terms of memory space, the WARM approach is outperformed by all the other four approaches. The results of the simulation experiments show that for 108 sensors the needed memory space using WARM is much higher than that using proposed approach. This is because the closed lattice data structure uses less memory space than the cube data structures, and it only stores the condensed closed itemsets information Figure 4. Performance study of memory usage for traffic monitoring application in MB V. CONCLUSTIONS Sensor stream applications are becoming very common with the advances in technologies for sensor devices. In this paper we propose a method to post mine non-redundant association rules, and used the result to produce missing data estimation in sensor network applications. The objective is to further reduce the resulting rules from non redundant association rule mining based on the users request, and apply the retrieved meaningful information to perform missing data estimation in wireless sensor networks We have evaluated the proposed technique with real data from a wireless sensor network of a traffic monitoring site Our proposed method is able to estimate missing sensor value with both time and space efficiency, and greatly improves the estimation accuracy. Our performance study 


shows that proposed post mining of association rule mining technique for missing sensor data estimation is an area worth to explore REFERENCES 1] Agrawal, R., & Imielinski, T., & Swami, A., "Mining association rules between sets of items in massive databases", International Conference on Management of Data, 1993 2] Austin, F.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm.

The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
