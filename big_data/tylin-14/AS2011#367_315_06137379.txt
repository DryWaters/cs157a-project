  T HE D EPLOYMENT OF MML FOR D ATA A NALYTICS OVER THE C LOUD  Jonathan Tancer and Aparna S. Varde Department of Computer Science Montclair State University Montclair, NJ, USA tancerj1 | vardea\@montclair.edu  Abstract Adoption of electronic records streamlines how critical information is stored and analyzed. A cloud computing environment provides vast storage capacity and CPU processing power for archival and analytics in a cost-effective 
manner.  In this paper we present a study of deploying the medical markup language MML for storing and analyzing data using cloud services. In addition to emphasizing the advantages of the cloud, we provide a brief risk analysis of using cloud services in such a crucial domain. While we focus our discussion on the medical domain, similar arguments are applicable to other domains with sensitive information Keywords  Association Rules  Markup Languages, Risk Analysis, Scientific Data, Senstive Information I  
 I NTRODUCTION  Electronic health records \(EHRs\ provide a detailed storage of patientsê medical history for analytical purposes By digitizing medical records it is hoped to improve the quality of healthcare services by facilitating analytics while reducing costs.  For example, hospitals can retrieve patient data and discover useful knowledge from it without contacting primary care physicians, thus saving precious time. Furthermore, electronic storage also allows easy access to the data for medical research which has potential long term benefits such as finding cures for some diseases and enhancing treatments for others. A large scale information system in which healthcare providers can easily 
add and update patient records is thus highly valuable Though large data centers can house and process massive amounts of information, hospitals and private medical care providers may not yet be willing to spend their own capital for implementing EHR systems.  A cloud model offers payas-you-go services. This service model allows entities which either cannot justify or do not have the capital to build their own information technology infrastructures, the capacity of using EHR systems.  A monthly fee needs to be paid to the party offering these services While the cloud offers a cost advantage over building 
locally housed systems, it introduces new problems.  All the information must be transmitted from the health care facility to the data center.  Transmission of data, especially sensitive personal data, can introduce sev eral new problems related to issues such as privacy and security ICDM-11 Workshops, December 2011, Vancouver, Canada Copyright IEEE 2011 All transmissions must be encrypted to protect patients information from attackers.  Additionally, the information being sent to the data center must be small enough that someone does not have to wait more than a few seconds 
every time a patient record is created, viewed, or modified In order to achieve concise up-to-date records, the medical markup language, MM h a s be e n cr ea t e d  In our work we investigate the deployment of MML to store and analyze patient data worldwide in conjunction with cloud services. We explain the advantages and outline the risks involved. Along the way, we also present some open questions and concerns II  MML  USAGE XML-based markup languages are often designed for various domai  T h e s e  l a ngua ge s fo l l o w the sy nta x of  
XML and encompass the semantics of the domain. Examples include CML, the Chemical Markup Language [7  MathML, the Mathematical Markup Language [3 a n d MML, the Medical Markup Language [5  T h e s e pro vi de domain-specific standards for data exchange worldwide allowing the information to be directly published on the Web without requiring conversion from relational formats The medical markup language, MML, was developed in Japan in 1995 by a group of scientists. MML is a very diverse easy- to-learn Web coding language designed using the XML tag set. MML allows quick and easy distribution of 
medical data over the Web. Figure 1 illustrates the general layout of an MML document as available in the literature [5               Figure 1: MML Document Layout  Leveloneé, the outer most level of an MML document contains two sections: the clinical_document_header and the body.  The clinical_document_header holds information

  about the document type, origination creation date healthcare provider information, basic patient information and the local header   Figure 2: MML Patient Code Snippet  MML can act as an intermediary between various EHR systems, thus serving as an Esperanto. An MML document is a container for medical data to be transferred from one health institution to another, even if both institutions implement different systems. Figure 2 contains the code segment for storing an individual patientês information [5   T h i s i s  contained in the çclinical_document_headeré of an MML document  In Figure 2, the patient tags record the patient type, the person \(id number and patient name\ the date of birth and administrative tags are set.  In this specific example, the patient is given a type of çPATé for patient.  Then the person brackets are opened and the patient id number of ç11111 and first and last name çJohné and çSmithé is assigned along with a birth-date of ç1990-01-01   Figure 3: MML Local Markup Code Snippet  Figure 3 contains a code snippet representing information about a patientês visit.  This code would be contained under the çlocal_markupé of an MML document within a content paragraph, section, and body.  The code reviews information about the visit, the patientês symptoms, and treatment.  We can see that Figure 3 begins with a tag local_markup [5    This tag is the inner most level of the body section contained in an MML document.  Very specific information provided by the healthcare provider is stored here.  Specific instances of visits, symptoms and treatments are found here. The physiciansê notes are stored in çmmlPc:FreeExpression The nature of MML makes it convenient for users to store data for worldwide access. Querying over this data is easily possible using languages such as XQuery. Data storage in MML also assists in the discovery of knowledge from the data which is in a semi-structured format. XML mining techniques such as clustering based on structure and content and frequent pattern mining for trees and graphs can be applied over this semi-structured data for knowledge discovery [11 A l s o  m e dic a l lit er atu r e s t or ed in on l i n e  tex t  repositories can be converted into a semi-structured format using MML. This would need some natural language processing followed by conversion using state-of-the-art approaches and could then serve as an additional source of information for XML-based knowledge discovery with various data mining methods [1   Figure 4: Example of Association Rule Mining  We now consider an example of applying the association rule mining technique using the classical Apriori algorithm over semi-structured MML data. This example illustrated in Figure 4 considers information in text sources of medical literature. In particular, it refers to publications on the subject of diabetes with documentation on specific cases. In this example, 80 cases of patients are found to have diabetic grandparents among a total of 90 cases considered in the whole set of text sources. Furthermore, 70 out of these 90 patients are themselves diagnosed with diabetes. Applying the Aprori algorithm over this data stored using semantic tags, we get a rule DiabeticGrandparent=yes 002  Diabetes=yes with a rule confidence of 60/80 = 75% and rule support of 60/90 = 67% using the given formulae.  This is indeed true in the domain of medicine that diabetes is likely to be passed on to the third generation, i.e., people can inherit it from their grandparents. Such analytical information would often be available in text sources of medical literature. Thus, the use of MML to store textual information in semi-structured formats facilitates rule derivation. The automated discovery of this knowledge can be useful in developing tools such as expert systems and intelligent tutors

  Having thus emphasized the use of MML for medical data analytics, it would be useful to take advantage of cloud services in conjunction with MML. We now take a close look at some of these cloud services, keeping in mind the angle of managing sensitive data III  CLOUD  SERVICES A. Types of Services It is well known to the data management and data mining communities that cloud computing providers offer several types of services to their clients.  The three major types of cloud services are infrastructure as a service \(IaaS\ platform as a service \(PaaS\ and software as a service \(SaaS The IaaS model allows a client to fully outsource their information technology infrastructure. A client outsources servers, software, and storage space eliminating the need for costly purchases of their own equipment The PaaS model benefits clients who need a quick and cost effective way to roll out their applications.  It eliminates the expense of purchasing hardware and the labor required to maintain that hardware The SaaS model simplifies and reduces the cost of maintaining a software application.  Because the software is stored in a centralized location in the cloud, it eliminates the need to install software on all machines that will need to use that software.  Clients may access the software through a Web interface rather than having an installed application Additionally the SaaS model makes various maintenance tasks such as upgrades, patches, and security fixes much simpler.  Instead of having to go over to each individual machine running an installed application for maintenance the desired maintenance task can be run once in the cloud With reference to our work, the most useful among these cloud services would be SaaS. This would allow users from multiple locations to store and analyze MML data online from locations all over the world without having to purchase and house the essential software such as XML editors and analytical tools. To some extent, PaaS would also be useful because individual parties would not have to purchase the required hardware B. Trends in Cloud Computing useful for MML Some of the existing research in the cloud computing area is interesting with respect to the use of MML for medical data storage and analytics worldwide. It could also be useful in other domains with similar needs In [9   th e au th o r s d e f i n e f u tu re p l atf orm r e qu i r em en ts  with respect to e-science. They emphasize that by the utilization of the cloud, meaningful scientific analysis which would have previously required many expensive machines can now be fully outsourced.  The alternative method they present for data analytics is a highly cost-effective approach that medical providers can use in conjunction with MML A system called Lithium is proposed by Wentzlaff et al 12 t o  of f e r v i r t u a l m ach in e s t o r ag e f o r th e cl ou d   T h is is  a  new type of storage system which will allow for high availability of very large amounts of data.  It includes fault tolerance to prevent data corruption.  With respect to our work, medical information stored in the cloud is sure to be a large amount of data, where such virtual storage could be very useful to share data worldwide for analytical purposes However, it is important to determine what can be kept on the virtual store. It may not be advisable to store highly sensitive data here because even though they deal with data corruption issues, they do not guarantee privacy. Thus, while sharing the patientsê MML records on the virtual store for analytics it may be useful to conceal any data that could lead to revealing their identity, e.g., SSN and date of birth With reference to our work, we can make rough estimates for the anticipated data loads for small, medium and large scale systems using MML.   A single populated MML file is about 10KB in size when first created.  As the patientsê medical history grows, and doctors add their notes the size of the file will grow. This includes only local markup which is text based.  It is worth noting that multimedia files such as X-Ray, CAT scan or MRI images and recorded voice notes may be referenced within the MML file, however the multimedia files are stored externally.  A basic formula can be used to determine file storage requirements.  Size = \(average MML document size average number of multimedia files per MML document average size of multimedia files\◊ number of patients Thus we claim that a small size medical practice with a couple hundred patients would require at first only require a few MB of storage to hold these newly created MML files However, a medium sized health institution holding 10,000 records would require 100MB of storage space while a large sized health organization in charge of hundreds of thousands of records would require storage worth even larger orders of magnitude to hold the MML files and their associated multimedia files Furthermore, we emphasize that a physician running a relatively small practice may be able to purchase a machine or even use existing equipment to create and store MML health records of their patients.  The cloud model would seem to benefit larger scale health facilities where costs would need to be minimized, and time to implement a system is urgent.  Additionally, accessibility of data for larger healthcare facilities is more important than that of a solo practitioner.  A larger facility may have doctors who work at multiple hospitals or may even own their own practice.  In this case only the cloud model could offer continuous access to patient records through a web interface regardless of the physiciansê locations A method called SkewReduce is presented in [6 f o r  skew-resistant parallel processing in the context of featureextracting scientific user-defined functions.  This paper discusses efficient algorithms for scientific data management in particular.  Since medical analytics involves dealing with huge amounts of data, it will certainly benefit from computationally efficient analytical algorithms. Such algorithms can be used to implement programs in any language that needs to store MML data and query it Yuan et al. [13 p r op os e a s t rat eg y f o r da ta pl ac em en t with reference to workflows in scientific clouds by adopting a k-means clustering-based approach. They group datasets in k data centers in the build-time phase of the workflow and 
190 


  dynamically adjust newly generated datasets to data centers by identifying dependencies in the run-time phase of the workflow. In [1 th e au th o r s  en h a n c e th ei r ea rl ie r a p p r oa ch  by retrieving deleted datasets and storing intermediate datasets using data dependency graphs for cost-effectiveness Both these approaches are applicable in the context of analyzing huge collections of MML data maintained by health care providers and insurance companies. They would be useful in clustering MML documents following the analogy of the approaches in these papers High Performance Computing \(HPC\lications are addressed in [4  Ga rg  et al T h ey  bu il d det ail e d  mathematical models for data center scheduling to develop energy-efficient solutions for HPC over the cloud. They incorporate the arrival rate of applications, carbon emission rate, electricity price, data transfer cost and other parameters in their model to conduct scheduling of HPC on the cloud in an environment-friendly manner. Medical applications are likely to involve high performance computing, and hence the mathematical models described here can be useful in tuning the concerned parameters to achieve energy efficiency and performance optimization while analyzing MML data Relevant to this area, we have investigated in our research that DryadLINQ [15  d e v e l o pe d by M i c r os of t  i s a  powerful HPC application programming language. The DryadLINQ software allows a programmer who is familiar with Microsoftês .NET programming languages to easily develop for DryadLINQ [Microsoftês large scale dataparallel computing language  without having the underlying understanding of how to program for distributed systems Language-integrated query, or LINQ, uses simple çfrom whereé, and çselecté clauses to query information stored in array, lists, SQL databases, or XML files.  DryadLINQ is specifically appropriate to our research because it may be used to query very large datasets over distributed system With respect to the cloud, DryadLINQ may be used in the Software as a Service, or SaaS cloud environment Apache Hadoop [16 is an o t h e r H P C s y s t em  w e are incorporating into our research efforts.  Hadoop is a very popular open-source HPC system which is used to process very large data sets across many machines.  Hadoop offers two specific technologies which is relevant to our research Hadooop Distributed Files System, or HDFS, keeps multiple copies of data chunks and which are distributed across many of the machines in the cluster.  This allows for more rapid processing and data reliability.  If a disk drive fails on a single machine, it is likely there is the same data on other machines in the cluster.  The availability and integrity of medical and other scientific data is of utmost importance and HDFS can be relied on to provide this.  Hadoop also offers its own version of MapReduce.  MapReduce is the framework on which applications that are capable of quickly processing large datasets are built upon.  These applications may be written in Java.  By utilizing efficient Hadoop MapReduce programs, the time required for mining large sets of medical data can be reduced.   Consequently, the cost of mining medical data sets can be reduced as well by making use of these systems and applications The issue of cost-modeling over the cloud has been addressed in works such as [10 b y  T r o ung et  a l   T h ey propose techniques to estimate, monitor and analyze the costs involved with running scientific applications on the cloud. They estimate the costs for service dependency and address typical scientific applications with respect to costeffectiveness. This is helpful to users of MML-based applications to determine whether it is worthwhile to use the cloud for their tasks, by specifically calculating the costs savings incurred the process Architecture and resource allocation policies are of interest to cloud computing researchers. In [1   th e au th o r s  define an architectural framework with the goal of making cloud computing energy-efficient. They also propose resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for energyefficiency keeping in mind Quality of Service \(QoS\eeds It is important to take into account such architectural issues in order to further enhance performance with respect to various QoS parameters in specific MML applications. This is in addition to using the software services provided by the cloud for optimization. This is useful for MML data storage and analysis, and also seems fairly risk-free C. Advantages of Cloud Services We have considered state-of-the-art developments in cloud computing which would be of interest in the context of medical analytics using MML. Cloud computing with its latest developments thus seems beneficial to MML users We present an example of Amazon cloud services here Amazon offers specific services on the cloud which could be used to conduct analysis of medical data.  Amazonês Elastic Compute Cloud \(EC2  s e r v i c e i s co st e ffe c t i v e i n  t h e sense that there is no expensive server hardware to purchase on the clientês end.  Data is uploaded to EC2, where the analysis is performed, and then the results can be downloaded.   Amazon offers High Performance Computing features as part of their service.  Specifically, it offers Amazon Elastic MapReduce which uses the previously mentioned Hadoop MapReduce HPC algorithm In figure 5, Amazonês EC2 standard on-demand instance pricing structure can be found.  The prices are in terms of instance hours.  Note that each partially used hour is billed as a full hour  Size Linux/UNIX Windows Small 0.085 $0.12 Large 0.34 $0.48 Extra large 0.68 0.96 Figure 5: Amazon EC2 on-demand Instance Pricing Chart  Based on all the discussion presented with respect to cloud services so far, we now elaborate on a few benefits below 1. Cost savings MML users would certainly cut down on their costs by taking advantage of cloud services. They would not incur huge capital investments but would rather use a more costeffective pay-as-you-go approach. This is particularly significant when large amounts of MML data have to be shared for analytics in a research 
191 


  project. This could be useful for knowledge discovery among various medical professionals and also for computer scientists mining the medical data for developing software such as expert systems and intelligent tutors. For example, with reference to our rough estimates for anticipated data loads \(see Section III B\, this could incur cost savings of buying the additional hardware needed for storing and analyzing all the data in MML.  For example purchasing a $1,000 server to analyze MML data would not be cost effective.  Assuming our data analysis is a standard \(small - $0.085 per hour\ on demand instance, the same $1,000 would net over 11,000 hours of EC2 time.  Utilizing Amazonês EC2 in conjunction with the HPC algorithms would also prove to be much more efficient in processing the data because the load would be distributed across many machines, not confined to a single expensive server. Also, 11,000 hours of analysis utilizing EC2 would prove to be much more productive than 11,000 hours of analysis on a single server  2. Energy-efficiency MML applications would be more efficient in terms of power consumption and energy usage, thus benefitting the users as well as the environment. This is especially helpful in analytical tools requiring high performance computing that can employ computationally efficient algorithms over the cloud and also take advantage of its architectural advancements.  A small sized institution which may only require one server to house and analyze medical data may only slightly benefit by the energy-efficiency the cloud has to offer.  A much larger institution which may require an entire cluster of machines to house and analyze medical data would benefit significantly more from an energy-efficiency standpoint.  Thus, by utilizing energy efficient HPC algorithms the cloud has to offer, the larger institution may stand to gain the most in terms of energy-efficiency  3. Globalization Since cloud service providers offer easy-to-use worldwide access, this is yet another step in the broad realm of globalization. This is helpful to professionals from medical fields in exchanging important information as well as collaborating on applications using MML. For example, XML clustering and frequent pattern mining applications based on the structure and content of the data could require a huge number of MML documents in distributed locations. Cloud services would be very helpful here, since documents stored on a given server in one location could easily be made available to all the collaborators without additional storage 4. Green Technologies The use of cloud computing in storing and analyzing MML data inspires further research in the area of green computing. Users would be particularly concerned about the impacts of their work in terms of greening the planet and would strive towards a good balance between optimizing their performance and achieving çgreennessé. They would thus be interested in work such as defining metrics for greenness with respect to targeted applications and conducting detailed studies on complexity while using MML in conjunction with cloud services. The outcome of such research would be useful in other domains as well IV  RISK  ANALYSIS While examining the risks involved in data analytics using MML over the cloud we need to stress on the fact that MML is aimed to be a lingua franca for medical data storage and furthermore that it can be used along with cloud services offering benefits in worldwide data exchange MML was not originally designed with cloud services in mind. We therefore consider the potential risks involved in deploying MML over the cloud, such as the use of data warehouses, privacy concerns, security aspects, legal issues and resistance to change. The arguments presented here are not unique to MML and other users can also draw analogies A. Whether to Use Data Warehouses The use of large data warehouses can prove to be helpful in storing huge amounts of MML data over the cloud Distributed data warehouses allow almost one hundred percent accessibility.  If one server crashes, another can pick up where the first one left off, without the end user ever knowing about it.  If a specific hard disk fails, a copy of the data can be found elsewhere It is important to determine whether private data warehouses should exist solely for the purpose of housing MML records. It seems too expensive to build and run data centers just for this purpose.  It may prove to be cheaper to outsource the cloud services to companies such as Google Microsoft, Yahoo, or Amazon. Current state-of-the-art technologies allow speeding up the transition of cloud adoption for digital medical records. However, let us now examine the risk associated with this cloud adoption With reference to section IV B, we presented a formula for roughly determining the required storage space for MML files.  Size = \(average MML document size + average number of multimedia files per MML document ◊ average size of multimedia files\ ◊ number of patients.  Medium and larger sized institutions making use of MML would clearly require a much larger amount of storage space than that of much smaller institutions.  The risk of storing this information in shared commercial data centers would clearly rise for larger institutions.  Storing tens of thousands of patients records could potentially consume terabytes of storage space, which likely means this information would distributes across several physical machines A private \(non-government entity\ompany would want to get the most out of their servers to reduce their own costs Consider this with respect to MML data from two separate clients which may be stored physically on the hard disks Virtually, the software and the data would be separate, but the data may be physically placed on the same hard drive Thus, if a software bug or glitch is exposed, it could potentially lead to a leak of personal sensitive healthcare 
192 


  information stored using MML.  This is a serious issue and is therefore identified as a potential risk  B. Privacy Concerns Many questions can be raised regarding privacy with respect to MML data storage and analytics.  For example who will set privacy standards and industry best practices How much and what information should a health care provider have access too?  Who will store the data MML data will need to be protected from outsider unauthorized access. This will require cloud providers to run secure cloud services both physically and virtually.  If an online interface exists where patients can view their own information from their home computer, then an important question is çWho should have access to what data?é  Patients should in theory be able to view their own medical records but should not have access to anyone elseês by default Parents may be granted access to their childrenês medical records till they are no longer dependent on their parents The disabled and the elderly may grant access to others if they are unable to view their own records Moreover, should any doctor be able to look up anyoneês digital medical information even if they are not their patient Suppose a doctor looked up the medical information of a fortune 500 company CEO and saw they had a lethal disease unbeknownst to the public, and based on that information performed a financial transaction with inside knowledge Who would determine exactly which patientsê records a doctor should have access to? When knowledge discovery over medical data is important from a research perspective such issues are very prominent. Likewise, there are many concerns over privacy.  It will be quite interesting to see how all these concerns will be addressed over the coming years with an increasing number of MML users and EHR systems C. Security Aspects Security is of the utmost importance when dealing with confidential medical information and thus is an issue in MML data analytics over the cloud. There should be both physical and virtual protection for the precious data. The data must be resistant to natural disaster and intruders. If there is a power outage, it is important to know whether there is a backup generator to make sure all systems stay online to avoid data corruption.  Another imporant issue is whether the data that is stored at a specific location is duplicated at another physical location in the event there is flooding or a building collapse Data is also vulnerable from a software standpoint Servers that are connected to the outside Internet must be behind firewalls to prevent virtual intruders from gaining unauthorized access.  Users who have authorized access should be limited to only their own level of access.  For example, a patient and a doctor using MML may both have access to the system.  However, a doctor should be able to view the records of all their patients, while a patient should only have access to their own record If cloud services for the storage of MML data are contracted to third party companies such as Google Amazon, Yahoo or Microsoft, additional levels of software security must be present. These companies sell their services to the public and could potentially have multiple clients data physically stored on the same machine.  The data in theory is separated by the use of virtual servers and software, however all possible bugs must be uncovered to rule out any chance of unauthorized access to MML data A small sized institution, for example a single private practitioner, which may only need to keep records of several hundred patients would require less storage space and also have fewer users, thus being less of a target for unauthorized access compared to a larger institution.  Several gigabytes of information would probably be all that is required to store all of the patient information, whereas for a larger institution several terabytes may be required A larger sized institution with hundreds of users would require additional layers of security to protect data which would likely be spread across multiple machines in the cloud.  Additionally, because there is simply a larger amount of information, it is likely to be a greater target for unauthorized access.  However, outside threats are not the only concern to a larger institution.  Because there are many more end users handling the data, a permission system must exist.  This would ensure that only relevant care providers have access to only their own patientsê data D. Legal Issues There are several legal questions which will be presented regarding cloud computing and MML data.  Who will ultimately be responsible for the data?  If a data breach is detected who is legally held responsible, and who is responsible for regulating and auditing the system to prevent possible future breaches? Such issues are very important to address when multiple parties are involved. We need to deal with patients and their families, health care providers that may be individuals or hospitals, insurance companies and in some cases even universities that are affiliated with hospitals in order to train medical staff It seems logical that a larger institution would require a greater attention to legal issues.  With more parties involved and also with more sensitive information at stake there is a greater liability All these issues become even more prominent when we are dealing with MML data on a global level. This is because different countries have varying laws and ethics. The rules and regulations in the USA for example may be different from those in Japan where MML was developed. It is thus important to answer the questions that arise with respect to legal issues. It is also useful to document these for future reference in legal cases E. Resistance to Change Mankind in general is resistant to change of any nature This will be a huge hurdle in the adoption of digitizing health records using MML within a cloud environment 
193 


  Physicians are accustomed to the way they run and operate their practices.  The change over phase will likely be much more difficult for smaller health care facilities Training doctors and other medical professionals to use a new system is not an easy task, even though these are highly educated individuals.  It may take months or even years and cost the medical practice a considerable amount of money Doctors may need to scale back their office hours during the transition phase to allow themselves and their office staff to adjust to new systems Patients also may be used to the traditional paper-andpen medium in storing their own medical records. Moreover several patients may not even be well-educated to get used to computerized systems, let alone migrating to MML over the cloud. This is a severe concern and is even more prominent in view of the other risks outlined so far V  DISCUSSION A. Real World Scenario There are companies that have already been creating and testing digital medical record systems over the cloud.  The Scottish cloud computing provider, Flexiant, announced on June 20 th 2011 that they will be providing their cloud computing platform as part of a research project that will aim to give patients more control over their own digital medical records  Flexiant states that their pi oneer i ng cl o ud pl at f o r m  Extility, will be the first large scale deployment of the cloud in e-health In their system, the patient will control who has access to their digital medical records.  Additionally, as part of their research they plan to solve many of the problems with existing electronic patient record systems They hope to aid in the creation of standards within digital medical records system to allow for more compatibility between different systems This seems like an excellent start and makes a very strong case for achieving even better performance with MML over the cloud. The use of MML would aid in standardization and globalization, while also facilitating information retrieval using XQuery and knowledge discovery using XML mining techniques B. Other Domains The arguments we have made here could be considered valid for various other domains with sensitive information A few examples of such domains include but are not limited to aerospace, life sciences, nanotechnology, environmental studies and biomedical engineering. Much of the information in these domains may be of a critical nature and there are huge concerns regarding security, privacy, legal issues and other factors Whether or not to use cloud services here may depend largely on the nature of the targeted applications. For example, a biological experi ment may involve human subjects and generate data of such a private nature that sharing it over the cloud may pose serious concerns. On the other hand, environmental scientists may consider greening the planet a huge priority and if they have applications where privacy is not a big issue, cloud services may seem to be the best solution C. Challenges Some of the challenges in this effort leading to further work include   Procuring large amounts of real patient information taking into account privacy issues in using MML over the cloud   Running further mining techniques other than association rules  with more real data, e.g., using MML along with XML clustering techniques and investigating how these can benefit from cloud services   Conducting knowledge discovery with respect to specifically targeted applications, e.g., using MML and cloud services to develop electronic health records \(EHR\or applying the results to preventive care   Building an easy-to-use tool and graphical user interface to query MML files that would address the issue of resistance to change   Further application of the High Performance Computing algorithms such as Dryad-LINQ and Hadoop in MML and cloud computing studies  VI  CONCLUSIONS We have addressed the deployment of an XML-based domain-specific standard for data storage and analysis over the cloud. We have considered factors such as cost savings and energy efficiency while outlining the advantages of cloud services. We have also overviewed the risks associated with this process taking into account aspects such as security privacy and legal issues A substantial amount of future work in this initiative would emerge from addressing the challenges outlined above. In addition, some more future issues would involve defining metrics for greenness and efficiency; assessing specific risks with detailed calculations; comparing the relational and XML models for data storage over the cloud considering complexity among other factors; and conducting exhaustive user surveys in targeted applications   VII  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is supported by a grant from Roche and Merck pharmaceuticals given to Montclair State University for their Science Honors Innovations Program.

separate steps Step 1: minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database Step 2: these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules 2 In 1994, Agrawal with other scholars worked out Apriori algorithm. The core principle is that the subsets of a frequent itemset are still frequent itemsets and the supersets of an unfrequent itemset are still unfrequent. Moreover, Apriori is a kind of iterative algorithm which is based on a two-stage mining thought for frequent itemsets. In detail, Apriori uses a bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time \(a step known as candidate generation groups of candidates are tested against the data. From L1 to Lk the algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. But one attention of Apriori is that when searching for frequent subset Lk from Lk-1, connection and pruning will be done in the process. And finally association rules will result from the frequent itemsets[12 3 With software Weka3.5.8, some association rules between three information techniques \(call centre, SMS and network platform under the condition of probability=0.5, confidence=0.4 Therefore, some strong association rules with high confidence have been listed typically in Table.2 TABLE II.

And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, farmers are still worried about the attitude of neighbors around to their behavior 4.CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION From the mining results, we bring forward following conclusions A. Build various communication channels and provide differentiation information technology Farmers who have few communication channels dont want to adopt new techniques because of their limited family economic ability. We suggest government should try to reduce the risk and cost of technique adoption, promote various communication channels with different charging standards or provide some benefits of different degrees B.  Intensify farmers education and improve farmers certification of techniques Government should undertake some temporary training courses to instruct farmers some new information technologies for rural areas and let farmers be acquaint with these techniques. In this way, first farmers certification and then the information technology adoption rate will be improved C. Reduce technique cost and improve service quality It will do well in the technique promotion when the technique charging is lower and techniques are more various Moreover, considering that the service quality will influence farmers technology adoption intention and behavior information service institutions should try to perfect the quality through better satisfying farmers information demands and more reducing service cost. In this way, farmers information technology adoption will be promoted ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper is sponsored by Beijing forestry university Scientific and Technological Innovation Project BLRW200922 REFERENCES 1] Artesyn technologies: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Phone Covered 99.8% of Administrative Villages While Broadband Covered 96% of Villages and Towns. 3      December  2009. 20 June

Our literature survey discovered an association between them such that rs256871 SNP is part of SEPT8 gene, and, in turn the SEPT8 gene is known to be accountable for tuberculosis among Asians [12 Nonetheless, most of the rules found in this study were difficult to interpret, because, out of more than 660,000 SNPs used in the study, very small numbers of such SNPs had been subject to research for  3 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218008T 4 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218014Q 322 determining the relations with particular traits such as population and geographical region.

Rules extracted from the third experiment where the associations between SNP genotypes and geographical regions are identified The M and m refer to major and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively  6. Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
