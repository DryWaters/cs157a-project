Such data not only take over large amount\nof database storage, but also increase the dif?culties for data\nanalysis due to data diversity, which, also makes the datasets\nseemingly isolated with each other. In this paper, we present a\nsolution to the problem that is to build up connections among\nthe diverse datasets, based upon their similarities. Particularly,\na concept of similarity graph along with a similarity graph\ngeneration algorithm were introduced. We then proposed a\nsimilarity graph reduction algorithm that reduces vertices of the\ngraph for the purpose of graph simpli?cation.\nKeywords—Big Data; Categorical Data; Similarity; Algorithm\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBig Data is the term usually referred as very large datasets\nbecause of their volumes. Apart from the sheer large size, these\ndatasets also present diversity containing data collected from\nmultiple social or scienti?c domains such as data collected\nfrom climate sensors, transaction records, social media site\nposts, emails on public email servers, and so on. Such data\nnot only take over large amount of database storage, but also\nincrease the dif?culties for data analysis because of data diver-\nsity. As an example, the “long tail of science” data, described\nby Palmer et al. [11 12], consist of a massive number of\nrelatively small datasets. Even every single dataset is small\nand easy to manage, the totality of all datasets still leads to a\nfundamental Big Data problem that the massive diverse small\ndatasets, existing in almost total isolation from one another,\nincrease the dif?culties of their usages for multidisciplinary\ncollaborative research. Thus, discovering connections among\nthose datasets becomes crucial.\nA solution to the problem is to discover a certain type of\nrelationships among diverse datasets Network/Graph theories\nare usually applied for identifying connections between enti-\nties. For instance, the Sociometric Network Analysis theory\n[6], [8], [9], [10] uses graph structures to model social re-\nlationships among individuals. Similarly, we decided to use\ngraph structures to model datasets and their relationships.\nSpeci?cally, our goal of this research is twofold: First, we want\nto be able to draw an undirected graph with each node denoting\none dataset and weighted edges representing their relationships\nmeasured based on their similarities; Second, since size of\nthe undirected graph can be very large, a graph reduction\nmethodology is required in order to simplify its structure, by\nmerging certain amount of nodes which are highly similar to\neach other into one single node. Therefore, our contributions\nof this paper are as follows:1 similarity\ngraph generation; 2 cliques, through the\ngreedy pivoting strategy and the random pivoting strategy,\nrespectively; 3 graph reduction algorithm was\nproposed for the purpose of reducing total number of vertices\nwithin a similarity graph.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section II,\nwe brie?y reviewed some related work, including similarity\nmeasures on numerical data and categorical data and current\nexisting graph reduction methodologies; Detailed similarity\ngraph generation and reduction algorithms are described in\nsection III; We concluded the paper in section IV.\nII. RELATED WORK\nIn this section, we provide brief reviews on some related\nwork, including similarity measures and network graph reduc-\ntion methodologies.\nA Similarity Measures on Numerical Data and Categorical\nData\nSimilarity of two entities, in a network graph sense, is\ncommonly de?ned as the distance between them. The shorter\nthe distance the higher the similarity that is shared by the two\nentities.

Data that have\nnon-numerical values are often referred as categorical data.\nAnalytically, let us consider two categorical data points, X\n X1,X2,...,Xn} and Y = {Y1,Y2,...,Yn} in which both X\nand Y take values under n categorical attributes. It is rst\nto measure the similarity between each pair of Xk and Yk\n\(k ? [1, n Xk, Yk similarity between\ndata points X and Y is then simply measured as a linear\ncombination of every Sk \(Xk, Yk denoting as: S \(X,Y Xk, Yk 


3] summarized a list of methods\nfor the implementations of Sk \(Xk, Yk please see [3].\nB. Graph Reduction Methodologies\nLoosely speaking, the goal of graph reduction is to reduce\na graph following certain pre-de?ned rules, from its original\ncomplex structure to a reduced simple structure in order to\nreveal some information previously dif?cult to be discovered.\nGraph reduction methods are widely applied in the ?eld of\nprocess modeling [13], [14], [7], where work?ow graphs are\nused to model tasks processes. A work?ow graph is a directed\nacyclic graph starting with one initial node as well as ending\nwith one ?nal node. The initial node has no incoming ?ows,\nwhile the ?nal node has no outgoing ?ows. Structural con?icts,\nsuch as deadlock and lack of synchronization, may present\nif work?ow graphs are not properly designed. In this case,\nSadiq and Orlowska [13], [14] proposed a graph reduction\nmethod for identifying such structural con?icts based on a set\nof reduction rules. Their proposed method was later improved\nby Lin et al 7] via providing a more comprehensive reduction\nrule set. A depth-?rst graph reduction algorithm was proposed\nby Bartha and Kre´sz [2]. The algorithm was to shrink an\nundirected graph, along with its 2-star subgraphs. This greedy\nalgorithm works under a computational complexity of O \(m edges in the given graph.\nCurrent existing graph reduction methodologies focus on\ndirected graphs that cannot be applied onto undirected graphs.\nTherefore, in section III, we will present our detailed ap-\nproaches on undirected similarity graph generation and reduc-\ntion.\nIII. SIMILARITY GRAPH GENERATION AND REDUCTION\nA. The Similarity Graph Generation\nAn undirected graph G=\(V,E and a set of edges, E={u, v}. ? \(u, v A\nsimilarity graph is an undirected graph with weighted edges,\nwhere a similarity value is assigned to each pair of \(u, v  value of 1 indicating identical and\na value of 0 implying completely different. As an adjacency\nmatrix, the data structure that stores an undirected graph, a\nsimilarity adjacency matrix is the data structure that stores\na similarity graph. To elaborate this, we will show how to\nconstruct a similarity graph from a similarity adjacency matrix.\nLet us consider an example that is to generate a similarity\ngraph for 4 nodes v1, v2, v3, v4}. The similarity adjacency\nmatrix is given in table II.\nvn v1 v2 v3 v4\nv1 1 S \(v1, v2 v1 v3 v1, v4 v2, v1 v2, v3 v2, v4 v3, v1 v3, v2 v3, v4 v4, v1 v4, v2 v4, v3 in table II,\nconsists of four ones, which are the similarities measured from\n4-pair of identical nodes, S \(v1 v1 v2, v2 v3, v3 v4, v4 from each pair of different nodes.\nFig. 1: A Similarity Graph\nGiven a collection of measured similarities, S v1, v2 v1, v3 v1, v4 v2, v3 v2, v4 v3, v4 showing the relevant\nsimilarity graph in ?gure 1. There is no edge between node\n3 and 4 since S \(v3, v4 Now the problem of similar-\nity graph generation essentially becomes to the problem of\nsimilarity adjacency matrix computation. That is as long as a\nsimilarity adjacency matrix is ?lled out, the relevant similarity\ngraph then can be plotted.\nTo explain the process of similarity value computation,\nlet us recall the aforementioned categorical data points, X\n= {X1,X2,...,Xn} and Y = {Y1,Y2,...,Yn}. ?Xk ? X and\n?Yk ? Y Xk| = |{x1, x2, ..., xi}| = ik and |Yk| =\n|{y1, y2, ..., yj}| = jk. This indicates that both categorical\nattributes, Xk and Yk, have a number of ik and jk values,\nrespectively. Assuming that ik = jk = 3 table III contains\nsimilarity values of each pair of \(xi, yj data points\nis described in algorithm 1. The proposed algorithm requires\ntwo data points as its input and outputs a similarity value.\nSpeci?cally, for each attribute of X and Y , the algorithm ?rst\n686\nYk\ny1 y2 y3\nXk\nx1 Sk \(x1, y1 x1, y2 x1, y3 x2, y1 x2, y2 x2, y3 x3, y1 x3, y2 Sk \(x3, y3 X1,X2,...,Xn} and Y = {Y1,Y2,...,Yn}\nOutput: S \(X,Y Xk| , |Yk X,Y Xk, Yk V alueList X,Y Xk, Yk X,Y cardinality to K, then it computes an\nattribute similarity matrix. All elements in the matrix are then\nextracted into a value list. The value list is sorted such that\nthe mean of the top K values can be computed and assigned\nas Sk \(Xk, Yk X,Y Xk Yk similarity simi-\nlarity provided\nas the following:\nDe?nition 1: /Similarity Graph Reduction \(SGR V,E nV\n?\n, E\n?\n and\n???E?\n??? <\n|E|.\nAs shown in ?gure 1, nodes of a similarity graph are\nconnected through similarity edges 


edges mounted with simi-\nlarity values their distance measures \(as the measures shown\nin table I of\nsimilarity graph reduction that is: If a similarity value of a pair\nof nodes is suf?ciently high, the distance between the two\nnodes is negligible. For instance, if two nodes are identical\n\(with the similarity value being of 1 easy to think of other situations where the number of\nnodes is more than two. Hence, a formal de?nition is required\nin order to proceed without loss of generality.\nDe?nition 2: /Similarity Clique \(SC nodes,\nN and |N | ? 2, N is said to form a Similarity Clique if and\nonly if both of the following two conditions hold: 1 the complete graph is suf?ciently large,\nsuch that S \(u, v similarity clique is of a formal statement\nfor the situations having more than two nodes. Meanwhile,\nit also suggests a measure towards the claim of “suf?ciently\nlarge”, by introducing an arbitrary threshold value The\navailability of the threshold value manipulation grants ?exi-\nbilities for quantifying a “suf?ciently large” value. In other\nwords, we are able to control an SC’s similarity level through\nadjusting the value of nAn SC gathers a group of nodes among which the distances\nare negligible. For the purpose of similarity graph reduction,\nwe are in fact more interested in a maximal similarity clique\nrather than a similarity clique.\nDe?nition 3: /Maximal Similarity Clique \(MSC Similarity Clique if\nit violates the necessary and suf?cient conditions of being a\nsimilarity clique by adding one more adjacent vertex.\nIf we can merge every MSC discovered in a similarity\ngraph into a single node, the number of nodes along with the\nnumber of edges in the original graph will be reduced. Because\nwhenever a k-node MSC is replaced by a single node, there\nare, at least, k\n2?k\n2 edges and k ? 1 nodes reduced from the\noriginal graph.\nThere is no ef?cient way to identify all maximal similarity\ncliques in a similarity graph In fact, we will prove that the\nmaximal similarity clique problem is NP ?complete, assum-\ning P = NP . To prove the maximal similarity clique problem\nis NP ?complete, we just need to show that the problem can\nbe successfully reduced to an existingNP?complete problem\nin polynomial time, namely the maximal clique problem 1],\n[4], [5].\nTheorem 1: The problem of identifying all maximal sim-\nilarity cliques \(or the maximal similarity clique problem  that outputs 0 or 1 depending on its input. Given a\nsimilarity adjacency matrix, M , and a threshold value it is\neasy to construct an adjacency matrix, A, by applying A mij aij = 0, if\nmij < ?; aij = 1, otherwise. Hence, given the adjacency\nmatrix, A, the maximal similarity clique problem becomes\nthe maximal clique problem. If there exist a polynomial\ntime solution for the maximal clique problem based on A,\nthere must exist a polynomial time solution for the maximal\nsimilarity clique problem based on M .\nAlgorithm 2 is provided for solving the maximal similarity\nclique problem. The algorithm is essentially based on the\nrecursive backtracking algorithm proposed by Bron and Ker-\nbosch [4] for maximal clique enumerations with pivoting. The\ninput of algorithm 2 is G, an undirected graph summarizing in\nM . The output is a list of maximal cliques found in G, where\nCliques = {C1, C2, ..., Cm} and ?Ci ? Cliques, Ci v}.\nThe algorithm maintains 3 set of vertices, R, P, and X. If both\nP and X are of empty sets, R is then saved to Cliques as a\nmaximal clique; otherwise, a pivot is selected from the union\nof the two sets, P and X and for every vertex v in P but is\nnot a neighbor of the selected pivot, the algorithm makes a\n687\nAlgorithm 2 Maximal Similarity Cliques\nInput: G = \(V,E R, P, X R\nreturn\nelse\npivot ? P ? X\nfor every vertex v in P\\N\(pivot R ?{v}, P ? N\(v v X ?{v}\nend for\nend if\nrecursive call in which v is added into R, at the same time, P\nand X are restricted to neighbors of v, N\(v lower than a given threshold, ?. It then moves v from\nP to X and continues with the next vertex in P. The algorithm\ninitialization is set to: MSC \(?, {VA a list of all nodes in\nGA. The algorithm runs under a computational complexity of\nO\n\(\n3n/3\n scenario.\nGiven the result of Cliques, there are situations that a\nsingle or multiple vertices are involving into multiple cliques.\nOne solution to this problem is to merge those repeating\nvertices into only one of the cliques such that they are not\ninvolving into any other cliques any more after the merging.\nFor example, if Cliques = {{A,B,C} , {C,D,E}}, in which\nthe repeating vertex is C. According to the solution, C can\nbe either merged into clique {A,B,C} or clique {C,D,E}.\nHowever, the clique that takes C should have a maximum\namount of similarities. The amount of similarities are mea-\nsured as the sum of all similarity values from each edge in\nthat clique,\n?\nCi\nS \(u, v merging, a list of new\ncliques will be produced as, {{A,B} , {C,D,E}}.\nThe New Cliques algorithm \(algorithm 3 


describes the\nprocess of producing a list of new cliques, in which the new\ncliques do not contain any repeating vertex. The algorithm\n?rst compares each clique in the input list to identify if there\nare any repeating vertices. If there do exist repeating vertices,\nthe algorithm returns the input clique list otherwise, it ?rst\ncompares similarities for each pair of cliques listed in Cliques\nand merges repeating nodes into the clique having maximum\nsimilarities and then it removes cliques with only one node\nleft and returns a list of new cliques.\nA NewCliques list with m cliques forms m new vertices\nfor a reduced similarity graph. The reduced graph consists of\na list of vertices, V\n?\n, where V\n?\n= V \\VNewCliques?{m}. Let\nV1 = V \\ VNewCliques V2 = {m}. Thus, all similarity edges\nof the graph forms a set of E\n?\n, where E\n? ? {V1 × V1} ?\nAlgorithm 3 New Cliques\nInput: Cliques = {C1, C2, ..., Cm}\nOutput: NewCliques\n1: if C1 ? C2 ? ... ?

Edges in V1 × V1 can be directly\ninherited from E, the original edge set, since the similarity\nvalue of each edge remains the same However, for the edges\nin V1 × V2 and V2 × V2, the computation of similarity values\nis required because of the m new nodes.\nAlgorithm 4 describes the entire process of similarity graph\nreduction. To demonstrate the process, let us consider the\nfollowing example. Given a similarity graph \(?gure 2\(a similarity graph reduction proceeds as the\nfollows: 1 3, 4, 5} , in 2\(a vertex 3\nfrom the clique {3, 4, 5}, since the clique {1, 2, 3} takes more\nsimilarities than the other one; 3 forms a new edge between\nthe two new nodes, where the similarity value is computed\nas\nS \(1, 4 3, 4 3, 5 b datasets that have very large volumes as\nwell as are of diverse.

Furthermore, we provided\na similarity graph reduction algorithm that reduces the total\nnumber of vertices within a similarity graph Speci?cally,\n688\nAlgorithm 4 Similarity Graph Reduction\nInput: G = \(V,E nV\n?\n E\n?\n G Cliques every vertex, v, in NewCliques do\n5: VNewCliques ? v\n6: end for\n7: V1 = V \\ VNewCliques\n8: for each pair of u, v u, v Ci, Cj NewV ertexi ?

The Mars Exploration Program may \nneed to establish more formal guidelines for the scope and \nschedule of testing related to verification and validation of \nrelay services, and ensure that all missions develop their test nschedules and corresponding resource profiles to meet those \nguidelines. \nEnd-to-End Relay Testbeds:  The fidelity of the end-to-end \ntestbeds for relay system testing can play a significant role \nin the overall success of the V&V test campaign.  For the \nMSL-MRO link, both the orbiter and lander projects had \nhigh fidelity spacecraft testbeds resident at JPL, with \nEngineering Models of the Electra and Electra-Lite ntransceivers, and with flight-like representations of the \nspacecraft Command & Data Handling \(C&DH subsystem.  \nWhile these testbeds were located at separate sites within \nthe JPL campus, fiber optic links supported signal flow \nbetween them, as well as integration of a high-fidelity link \nchannel simulator capable of emulating realistic time \nvariation of link amplitude, frequency, and delay, enabling \nthorough end-to-end data flow testing over a range of flight-\nlike signal conditions.  For ODY and MEX, however, each \norbiter project had only a portable test set available at JPL to \nsupport cross-project testing with MSL, each with a flight-\nlike UHF transceiver but with lower fidelity representations \nof the orbiter C&DH.  This limited the scope of ground \ntesting possible on the MSL-ODY and MSL-MEX links.  \nThis, combined with some non-flight-like aspects of the \nODY test set that were discovered late in the V&V test \ncampaign, resulted in the deferral of full validation and use \nof the MSL-ODY forward link capability until well after \nlanding.  The conclusions here are that high-fidelity testbeds \nincrease the robustness of end-to-end relay testing; when \nprogrammatic considerations limit the test hardware fidelity, \nit is essential to clearly document and assess any non-flight-\nlike aspects of the testbed infrastructure. \nElectromagnetic Interference:  Uncertainty in the MRO nEMI environment resulted in significant concern prior to \nMSL arrival as to whether Curiosity would be able to \nachieve the desired 250 Mb/sol data return via the MRO \nrelay path.  This resulted in a large amount of MRO flight \nand ground testing to attempt to better quantify the EMI \nimpacts as a function of Electra return link frequency.  It \nalso drove the need for a lengthy commissioning phase \nduring the first few months of MSL surface operations, to \ncarefully monitor performance as each MRO science \ninstrument was powered on Electra’s frequency-agility \nturned out to be an important tool in mitigating the EMI \nimpacts.  In hindsight earlier and more thorough flight \ntesting could have provided more confidence in the \npredicted MRO relay performance; however, such testing \nwould have required interruption of ongoing MRO science \nobservations Ultimately, future missions will want to \naddress EMI issues earlier in the spacecraft/instrument \ndevelopment cycle to identify and mitigate any spurious \nemissions prior to launch. \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nNASA’s ODY and MRO orbiters and ESA’s MEX orbiter \nembody an international network of Mars relay orbiters, \nproviding essential telecommunication services to the Mars \nScience Laboratory mission.  All three orbiters provided ncomplementary coverage of MSL’s EDL, acquiring tracking \nand telemetry data from MSL’s UHF transmission that ncould have provided essential information for fault \nreconstruction had a mission-ending anomaly occurred nduring EDL.  Since landing, ODY and MRO are providing \nthe highest levels of data return yet achieved for a Mars \nlander, with over 45 Gb of Curiosity data returned over the \nfirst 90 sols of the surface mission.  Key to this level of \nperformance are a number of new capabilities in the Electra \nand Electra-Lite UHF Transceivers on MRO and MSL, \nrespectively, including higher data rates, frequency-agile \noperations, and adaptive data rates, as well as the dedication \nof the operations teams on each mission and the MaROS nmultimission relay operations tools and processes \nsupporting them. \n \n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 11 \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe research described in this paper was carried out at the \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of \nTechnology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration. \nREFERENCES  \n [1] Charles D.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
