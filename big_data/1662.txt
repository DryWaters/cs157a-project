An Agent-Based Model for Trust Management in Electronic Collaboration\nRaoudha KOBBI, Wided LEJOUAD CHAARI\nLaboratory of Strategies of Optimization and Intelligent Computing \(SOIE Studies \(ENSI wided.chaari@ensi.rnu.tn\nAbstract\nThe communication and information technologies have\nrevolutionized the collaborative work making it more acces-\nsible. Electronic collaboration systems are more and more\nused in the domain of research community, for education\nsystems and in societies to insure the collaboration between\nemployees. We note also that the use of social networks\ncontinues to increase: Facebook and Twitter are very known\nexamples of electronic collaboration. But, these systems\nare faced with a big security challenge. In fact, they are\nexposed to malicious intrusions, identity usurpation and\ndata falsification Those security problems are a barrier for\nelectronic collaboration, that’s why Trust management must\nbe established to insure and maintain cooperation between\ndistributed nodes. In this paper, we propose a model that can\nbe applicable for any collaborative platform. It is based on\na multi level architecture authentication, analysis, security\nand monitoring levels. Each level is managed by agents.\nEach access to the collaborative platform must be controlled\nby an authentication agent. Analysis agent must identify\ncollaboration type and estimate trust level. Security agents\ndecide then if collaboration can take place. Decisions are\ntaken following a Case Based Reasoning method. During\ncollaboration, monitoring agents check any malicious behav-\nior.\n1 Introduction\nCollaboration is characterized by interactions between two\n\(or more from\nresolving a neighborhood or environmental dispute, to revi-\ntalizing an economically depressed area, to settling a conflict\nbetween communities, to a joint venture among businesses,\nto promoting greater civic participation and involvement in\nthe well-being of a community [5]. Collaborative work is,\nspecially requested for hard and complex work [6].\nElectronic collaboration is the use of information and\ncommunication technologies in order to reach collaboration\ngoals. It offers a lot of tools that facilitate the achievement\nof collaboration goals. This is due to better communication,\neasy share of documents and management tools such as\nelectronic agenda and shared calendar. However, this type\nof platforms is suffering from a major weakness which is\nlack of security. This lack is very dangerous since it can be\na serious handicap for the success of collaboration process [5].\nSecurity in collaborative systems has been treated in many\nstudies. Different approaches have been adopted to reach\nthis goal: approaches based on cryptographic and electronic\nsignature methods [10] , approaches based on intrusion\ndetection [11] and approaches based on trust management\n[12]. In our research, we have focused on methods based on\ntrust management.\nThis paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents\nrelated work, section 3 presents the method we propose\nto insure security in collaborative platforms, section 4 is\ndedicated to present how we implement this solution We\nfinish this paper with a conclusion and a presentation of the\nperspectives of this work.\n2 Related works\nAccording to the bibliography we have made, there is\ntwo essential approaches to manage trust in collaborative\nsystems. We find methods based on reputation, others based\non control access and some hybrid methods combining use\nof both reputation and access control. In this section, we\npresent these approaches.\n2.1 Trust management based on reputation\nIn [1], the authors describe a trust management model\nbased on reputation for P2P networks. In the proposed\napproach, users rate the reliability of parties they deal with.\nThey share this information with their peers in order to\nestablish trust among good peers and identify malicious ones.\nIn 3], authors present an Agent-based Trust Management\n\(ATM ATM\nmodule is composed of three types of agents, namely the\nmonitoring agent, the analysis agent and the security agent.\n2013 Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises\n978-0-7695-5002-2/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/WETICE.2013.80\n236197\nThe monitoring agent supervises a bidder and detects any\nabnormal bidding behavior; while the analysis and the\nsecurity agents can analyze state-based and history infor-\nmation of a bidder, and make decisions on shill detection,\nrespectively.\n2.2 Trust management based on access con-\ntrol\nIn [4], authors present a Trusted Network Connection \(TNC U-TNC with usage control \(UCON present also the mutability as\na criteria defining how to update the attributes which affect\ncurrent and future authorization decision. This mutability\nproperty enables the system to disconnect the endpoint\nwhose attributes disagree with security policies in time. It\nis also very important to invoke ongoing authorization.\n2.3 Trust management based on hybrid so-\nlution\nIn [2], a hybrid system based on reputation is proposed.\nThis system is dedicated to P2P networks. It introduces the\nnotion of friend peers. It combines the personal history of\neach user’s interactions with other users and the opinions\nof peer-friends together with 


global ratings of peers. It uses\nfriend notion to prevent malicious nodes from reducing the\nreputation of a peer in the network. This model presents\nalso a secure distributed framework ensuring that trust\nreports remain encrypted and are never opened during the\nsubmission or the aggregation process.\nExisting methods propose algorithms which are applied\non specific platforms. In our paper, we propose a method\nwhich is independent of the used platform.\n3 Proposed solution\nWe have noted through bibliography we have made that se-\ncurity is treated for specific collaboration platforms such as\nPeer to Peer platforms or Wikipedia platform, as exposed in\nsection 2. In our work, we have focused on security for all\ntypes of collaboration’s platforms. We have chosen to com-\npute trust by which we evaluate the security degree for a\npeaceful collaboration.\nThe solution we propose is based on the following concepts:\n• Trust management through a multi level architecture:\nto have a structured way to evaluate the security and\nto prevent attacks, we have opted for a multi level ar-\nchitecture. Each level is held by agents, acting together\nto compute trust and insure the security. We have cho-\nsen agents to implement this multi level structure since\nagents are autonomous tools able to perceive, act and\ninteract in flexible manner with their external environ-\nment. Furthermore agents can provide a high interac-\ntivity between different levels;\n• Definition of the type of collaboration the trust param-\neters are different from collaboration platform to an-\nother. To be able to evaluate trust for all collaboration\nplatforms we have defined three major types of collab-\noration: Resource share Information share, and Com-\nmunication. This classification is based on the type of\nservices and resources given in collaboration platforms.\nFor each type, we have associated and adapted a for-\nmula;\n• Definition of a Case Based Reasoning associated with a\nTrust Ontology: new or old not trustee nodes can be\nrejected since they don’t have good trust scores. To\navoid this issue we have defined a Trust ontology that\nwe have used through a Case Based Reasoning. This\nmechanism offers more chances to new nodes or users\nto initiate collaboration process. It allows also making\ndecision in case of detection of malicious behavior.\nWe detail in the following paragraphs these concepts\nand levels. The use of the Case Based Reasoning will be\ndeveloped in a future publication. We begin by exposing\nthe levels of the trust management. Then we describe\nthe different types of collaboration. Finally, we present\ncomputing trust formulas and a scenario of execution of our\nalgorithm.\n3.1 Trust management architecture\nFour levels are present in our solution. These levels are:\nAuthentication Monitoring, Analysis and Security. We\npresent below these four layers responsible to manage trust\nin electronic collaboration.\n3.1.1 Authentication layer\nAuthentication layer insures especially these functions:\n• Roles management;\n• Access rights management;\n• Classification through collaboration.\nBefore the connection to the collaboration platform,\nauthentication agent needs to verify the login, the password\nand the profile of the user that requests this connection.\nEach profile corresponds to one or more roles and some\naccess rights. Authentication is based on RBAC \(Role-based\nAccess Control guarantees that\nonly authorized users can get services and resources of the\nplatform. This access is based on user’s profile. In fact,\nusers are classified according to their profiles. Each profile\nis a set of one or more roles with authorizations. These\nauthorizations correspond to access modes needed by a\nspecific service or resource in the system.\n237208\nFigure 1: Database Architecture\nThis layer is also responsible to detect the type of collabo-\nration trough the three types we have defined. These classes\nare defined in section 3.2.\n3.1.2 Analysis layer\nAnalysis agent is responsible of:\n• Computing reputation and trust scores;\n Updating the collaboration database.\nIn collaboration operation, analysis agent computes trust\nscore and sends it to the security agent so that collaboration\ndecision can be taken. Security agent computes as well\nreputation scores following feedbacks of different users. The\ndata used by analysis agent are stored in a collaboration\ndatabase. The database can be structured as follows\n\(Fig.1 trust score must\nbe stored within it.\nAccording to the type of collaboration, parameters\nimpacting trust evaluation differ. That’s why we have a\nspecific formula for each of them. Section 3.3. gives the\nretained formulas for each type.\n3.1.3 Security layer\nSecurity agent is responsible of taking final decision related\nto collaboration. This decision depends on collaboration\nconditions, predefined thresholds and computed trust scores.\nIf trust score is lower than the predefined thresholds, then\nsecurity agent uses a Knowledge Based System \(KBS of collaboration from new\nusers. In our case the KBS used is a Case Based Reasoning\n\(CBR developed with the different concepts\nconcerning trust and collaboration in order to represent\nKnowledge Rules are also defined to be able to decide.\nAfter making decision, security agent informs monitoring\nagent so that collaboration can be proceeded.\n3.2 Types of collaboration\nThe detection of the type of collaboration requested is the\nkey of the trust evaluation process. In fact, parameters of\ntrust evaluation are loaded from the database and the calcu-\nlation formula is positioned since the type of collaboration\nis known. Depending 


on used tools and through the state of\nart, that we have made, we have classified collaboration into\nthree types.\nThe first type concerns the share of resources. This type\nof collaboration is found especially in peer to peer systems.\nIn this type of platforms, users can share any type of files,\nsuch as: data, software, music or videos. This share is\nobserved when one user U downloads a resource R from a\nnode N in the platform of collaboration. We have named\nthis type of collaboration ”Resource Share”. Youtube is a\nvery known platform offering this type of collaboration.\nThe second type of collaboration concerns any information\nthat a user can add to a collaboration platform. This type of\ncollaboration is, especially, observed in wikis. In fact wikis\nenables share of articles containing text, images and videos.\nA wiki might include workflow management blogs and\nimage and file galleries. We have named this type of collab-\noration ”Information Share”. Facebook and Wikipedia are\nexamples of platforms offering this type of collaboration [13].\nThe third type concerns communication. Communication\nis a real time interaction between two or more peers. Com-\nmunication can be audio or/and visual. There are a lot of\ntools offering this way of collaboration, we find online chat,\ninstant messaging and video conferencing. We have named\nthis type ”Communication”. Skype and Google talk are\nexamples of platforms offering this type of collaboration [13].\nCollaboration is, in general, a combination of one or\nmore of those types. Otherwise the collaboration type can\nchange with time; in fact a user on facebook can switch\nfrom chatting to sharing photos or videos. In our approach,\nthe first step of the algorithm is to identify the collaboration\ntype. This identification is the starter of the security\nmanagement process.\n3.3 Computing trust score\nA lot and a various services are offered by collaboration\nplatforms. In our work we have specified three types of\ncollaboration based on common characteristics and goals.\nFor each type we have associated and adapted a formula in\norder to be able to estimate the trust score.\n238219\n3.3.1 Computing trust score for Resource Share\nThe formula used for this type of collaboration is the\nfollowing. This formula is based on the studies presented in\n[7] and [2].\nRvu = \(wGvu ×Gu + wFv × Fvu\n+ wPvu × Pvu t?t0 parameters present in this formula are:\n• Rvu: the aggregate metric for peer u as seen by peer v;\n• wGvu: the weight assigned by v for the aggregation of\nthe global reputation of u;\n• Gu: the global reputation of u in the system, advertised\nand manipulated by u’s super peers;\n• wFv: the weight assigned by v for the aggregation of v’s\nfriends opinions about u;\n• Fvu: refers to v’s aggregate friends’ opinions about u.\nFvu is computed using simple averaging of the friends’\nopinions. Fvu excludes the opinions of suspicious friends\nby taking a default tolerant” average. That is, a subset\nof friends’ opinions is chosen that do not differ from one\nanother by more than a specified amount, and Fvu could\nbe calculated using only these opinions;\n• wPvu the weight assigned by v for the aggregation of\nthe personal history of peer v with peer u;\n• Pvu: refers to the personal history of peer v with\nu. It denotes the ratio of the number of ”authentic”\ninteractions to the total number of interactions between\nv and u. Note that all weights wGvu, wFv and wPvu\nare local variables and thus are particular to peer v.\nThe magnitude of the resulting local reputation metric\nRvu reveals peer u’s credibility as interpreted by peer\nv. In case a peer recently joined the system, its local\nreputation would be zero. These results in cold start\nproblems since the new joining peer would gain limited\nexposure due to its low reputation. We propose to re-\nsolve this problem by setting Rvu to wPvu × 5 if u did\nnot interact with any peer in the network.\nAfter extensive simulations, we identified the triplet\n\(wGvu,wFv,wPvu 0.2,0.35,0.45 to best cope with\nthe multitude of malicious strategies.\n• t0: last time during which collaboration with u was\ndone;\n• t: current time during which we hope perform collabo-\nration.\nWhen time changes, the reputation of nodes changes also,\nto have an unknown value. In fact, with time the behavior of\na node may change from trustworthy behavior to malicious\none, so that reputation information becomes not trustee.\n? constant is the speed with its reputation information\nmay become useless. That’s why we added the time to the\nformula.\n3.3.2 Computing trust score for Information Share\nComputing trust for information share is inspired from the\nstudy 8]. In case of data consultation, observations that we\ncan made concern insertions and deletions.\nWe suppose that we have the following declarations:\n• U : is the set of collaborators;\n• Rv: is the threshold of accepted reputation values, they\nare generally between 0 and 1;\n• Repi\(u after his\nith contribution. The reputation is included in U × Rv\nspace;\n• Revi\(a article a ;\n• |Revi\(a number\nof deleted tokens;\n• |ITi\(u its ith state.\nFor insertion Event, the following formula computes the\nuser’s reputation during it’s \(i+ 1 event:\nRepi+1\(u u u u u u reputation of a user uk during it’s\n\(i+ 1 the mth revision of\nan article by user u are deleted by user uj in the n\nth revision\nof the article.\nRepi+1\(uk uk uk uj uk n?m?1 uk uk 


that: IT0\(uk computing trust score\nfor communication was initially defined to ad hoc systems,\nbut we found it useful to use it for communication between\ncollaborators [9].\nThis method is based on the following principles:\n• If a node succeeds with regular manner to process data\nthen its reputation increases;\n• Local trust for an entity can be transmitted. The accep-\ntance of a recommendation depends on the trust degree\naccorded to the node proposing this recommendation;\n• A social relationship exists between nodes in order to\nestablish trustee relationship;\n• Transitivity principle can be applicable to this process\nif occurred;\n• Trust threshold Sc is a continue value in the interval\n]0..1] and the reputation value is a continue value in the\ninterval [0..1];\n If a node is known by other trustee nodes and if it has a\ngood behavior with these nodes so it will have maximal\ntrust threshold \(=1 V r 1 same;\n• Each unknown node starts with low trust level Sc = 0.1\nand with low reputation level V r = 0, this will oblige\nunknown nodes to have a good behavior.\nComputing trust score:\nSuppose that we have 2 nodes x and y and suppose that\nSc\(x y through another node, and\nafter a limited period of time, x can compute the reputation\nlevel.\nR\(X,Y of packets sent / Total number of\npackets\nThe number of routed packages is controlled by the\nmonitoring agent This agent checks the network traffic\nand computes the total number of packets and the packets\ncorrectly routed.\nAnalysis Agent generates reputation value of X nodes\nfollowing this principle: suppose that analysis agent receives\nan evaluation report of reputation sent by nodes responsible\nof control. The final calculus of the reputation value is sent\nto the nodes charged of control. The final reputation is\ncomputed as follows: If an agent receives k reports from\ncontrol nodes, then:\nRr\(y 1/k xi xi, y Execution Scenario\n3.4 Trust Management Scenario\nTrust management is insured through interactions between\nagents. The following section describes a scenario of execu-\ntion of our algorithm:\nBefore each collaboration request, the authentication step\nis necessary. After this step, analysis agent must compute\na trust score and give it to the security agent. This infor-\nmation enables the security agent to decide if collaboration\nrequest can be processed, basing on a threshold. A default\nvalue is given to this threshold and it must be updated\nthrough experimentation. After giving the permission for\ncollaboration, monitoring agent must detect every malicious\nbehavior and inform security agent to stop collaboration\nif necessary. It should be able also to detect any change\nof collaboration type with time. A trust score must be\nrecomputed then.\nAnalysis agent computes trust score using the formula\ncorresponding to the type of collaboration provided by\nauthentication agent. It uses also, for each case, a set of\ndata. These data were given in formulas described above and\nthey are stored in a common database and extracted from\nit when required. At the end of each collaboration process,\nthe database is updated with new values of trust parameters\nneeded to compute trust score for future requests. The\nfollowing figure presents the algorithm execution \(Fig.2 Experimentation\nIn order to test this method, we have implemented a proto-\ntype using the following tools:\n JADE \(Java Agent DEvelopment Framework  simplifies the implementation of multi-agent sys-\ntems through a middle-ware that uses the Agent Com-\nmunication Language \(ACL levels;\n• JENA [15] is a Java API for Ontology management. We\nhave used it in order to define and manage trust on-\ntology for the Case Based Reasoning. The ontology we\n240231\nhave defined is based essentially on following concepts:\nNode, Trust, Author, Article, and Collaboration \(for the\nthree types of collaboration we have defined Is Trusty”\nand ”Have Friend”. We have used ”Protege” software\nto develop this ontology.\nThe solution is composed of the following packages:\n• Authentication package: this package is responsible to\ncontrol the access to collaboration platform and to define\nthe collaboration type;\n• Analysis package: this package is responsible to compute\nthe trust score;\n• Security package: this package is responsible to decide\nif the collaboration can be proceeded according to the\ntrust score;\n• Monitoring package: this package is responsible to su-\npervise the collaboration process;\n• Inference package: this package is used by security pack-\nage to be able to decide about new nodes and while\ndetecting suspected behaviors;\n• Collaboration package: this package simulates collab-\noration process such as communications and data ex-\nchange.\nIn future studies we will finalize this implementation\nand expose some results showing the ability of the used\nalgorithm to detect malicious behavior and insure security.\n5 Conclusion, future work and per-\nspectives\nThis paper describes the skeleton of our approach to\nmanage trust in collaboration systems in order to insure\nsecurity. This model is based on defining different types of\ncollaboration and on using Case Based Reasoning. Through\nthis paper, we 


have presented essentially the architecture of\nour model, the role of each layer and the different types of\ncollaboration we have defined. In future work, we will give\nmore details for the Case Based Reasoning and it uses in\nour approach. We will focus also on refine the collaboration\ntypology and trust formulas. Besides a lot of monitoring\nstrategies are present in literature. A study concerning these\nstrategies can be done and a suitable one can be associated\nto our model.\nReferences\n[1] A. A.

the zero ?\ncases well, but not much value was placed in the average\nsurface pressure comparisons. Since the flow was chaotic and\nthe data acquisition rates varied so greatly between the CFD\nand WTT data, the averages obtained by the CFD and WTT\ndiffered greatly. The WTT data acquisition rates were also\nnot sufficient to gather enough samples for this chaotic flow.\nAs ? angle increased, the level of unsteadiness decreased in\nthe test, as seen with run 179 in Figure 12. This behavior\nwas not matched by OVERFLOW, which continued to predict\na highly chaotic flowfield at ? angles of 4? and 8?. This\nmay be a limitation in the grid system which was optimized\nfor a 1-nozzle configuration and then applied to multi-nozzle\nconfigurations.\n10\nFigure 12. Effects of ?; test shadowgraph compared to\nCFD constructed Schlieren/shadowgraph and average surface\npressure comparison for the 4-nozzle configuration, run 179:\nMach 2.4, CT 4. The CFD solver visualization for ? = 0? is\nFUN3D, and for the other ? angles is OVERFLOW.\nCode-to-code comparisons can be seen in Figure 13 for run\n166 \(Mach 1.8, CT 4 standoff distance of lower thrust coefficients.\nThis behavior was matched by FUN3D and OVERFLOW,\nbut a large standoff distance was predicted by DPLR. The\naverage surface CP by DPLR overpredicted FUN3D and\nOVERFLOW, both of which were closer to the test data.\nThe FUN3D CP data showed a more dynamic behavior than\nOVERFLOW and DPLR, a result of insufficient averaging.\nThe confidence in the ability of the CFD solvers to simulate\n4-nozzle flow is not as strong as it is for the 1-nozzle configu-\nration. The change in the short-penetration standoff distance\nto the wildly chaotic behavior was predicted to be at different\npoints between the CFD solvers. Due to the highly unsteady\nbehavior of the 4-nozzle configuration at CT s greater than\nfour, it was difficult to obtain reasonable average surface\npressure comparisons between the CFD and the WTT. Also,\nsteadier modes at angle of attack were seen for the 4-nozzle\nconfiguration which were not simulated with the CFD.\nThrust Dominance\nFor the SRP cases discussed, the total axial force \(CA,total =\nCT + CA,aero was dominated by the thrust coefficient and\nthe contribution of the aerodynamic axial force was very\nFigure 13. Code-to-code and code-to-test comparison of\nRun 166: 4-nozzle, Mach 1.8, CT 4.\nsmall. This can be seen in the bar chart in Figure 14 where\nthe gray section of the bars represent CT and the blue sec-\ntions represent CA,aero. This raises the question to whether\naerodynamic effects are negligible for these types of SRP\nflows More research needs to be conducted to answer this\nquestion. Entry trajectories and angles as well as spacecraft\nscale need to be taken into consideration. A high frequency\noscillation at the WTT scale will be a much lower frequency\nat the flight scale, and may have more contribution to vehicle\nstability. Normal force and the vehicle moments also need to\nbe taken into consideration, especially for non-zero vehicle\nentry angles.\nFigure 14. Comparison of the contributions of thrust and\naerodynamics to the total axial force for the ARC UPWT\nCFD cases run by OVERFLOW.\n11\nComputational Cost\nTable 2 shows a breakdown of the computational cost for each\nof the codes for a typical SRP run. This is not a perfect\ncomparison since the numbers represented are either just\nfrom a single run or averages of multiple runs. All cases were\ncomputed on the Pleiades NASA Advanced Supercomputing\ncluster, an SGI Ice cluster, on either Nehalem or Westmere\nnodes. Since each code used different amounts of time,\nnumber of iterations, number of sub-iterations, and number\nof grid points, a common metric of CPU seconds per iteration\nper grid point between the codes is reported for comparison.\nPart of the requirement for these validation runs was to test\nthe ability of the solvers to predict the SRP flowfields For\nthis reason, time-accurate runs were necessary because it\nis impossible to know beforehand if the unsteady effects\nplayed a large role in the aerodynamic effects. Costs for\nvalidation cases were large; however, for production runs of\nparametric studies or database generation, the computational\ncosts should be able to drop significantly as either steady state\nruns or higher efficient numerical and time step processes are\nadopted.\nTable 2. Computational Cost Per Case\nSolver CPU\nHours\nIterations Grid\nPoints\nCPU\ns/iter/gp\nFUN3D 28,000 39,500 4.2e7 6.1e-05\nDPLR 44,500 106,000 5.3e7 2.9e-05\nOVERFLOW 35,039 73,500 8.5e7 2.0e-05\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nA second wind tunnel test for validation of CFD in SRP\nconditions was conducted in the ARC UPWT 9?×7? tunnel.\nThe ARC UPWT test had a larger test section than the\nprevious test, which took place in the LRC UPWT 4?× 4?\ntunnel. With the larger test section, higher thrust coefficients\nwere obtained that closer match flight requirements.\nFor the 1-nozzle configuration, not much difference was\nobserved between the higher thrust coefficients of 4 obtained\nin the ARC UPWT and the lower thrust coefficients of 2\nobtained in the LRC UPWT. The short-penetration shock\ninteraction structure was observed, and oscillations at the\ntriple point increased for the windward triple point as angle\nof attack was increased. The CFD solvers compared well\nto the 1-nozzle cases in the CFD matrix, only varying in\npredicting periodic oscillations of the triple point when ran-\ndom oscillations were observed in the test. Average surface\npressure comparisons were promising, building confidence in\nthe ability of CFD to predict 1-nozzle configuration SRP.\nFor the 3-nozzle configuration, the unsteady behavior noted\nat lower thrust coefficients of 2 did not exist for higher thrust\ncoefficients where 


the flow structure becomes more steady,\nespecially in the bow shock. This behavior was predicted\nwell with the CFD, and average surface pressures agreed well\nwith the WTT. The area of greatest deviation between the\ncodes was along the model shoulder and at the model nose.\nThe differences at the nose are attributed to differences in\nentrainment, entrapment, and recirculation being simulated\nbetween the codes at the model nose, as well as any shear\nlayer interaction that may be occurring between the plumes.\nAt ? and ?T 12?, OVERFLOW did not predict the same be-\nhavior as the WTT, predicting a more compressed windward\nbarrel plume for most cases This discrepancy in qualitative\ncomparison did not seem to greatly influence the average\nsurface pressure comparison.\nFor the 4-nozzle configuration, a steadier mode with a short\nshock standoff distance existed for lower CT s. As CT was\nincreased, the flow becomes highly unsteady with the bow\nshock standoff distance aperiodically oscillating between\nsmall and large standoff distances. The unsteady flowfield\nwas predicted well with the CFD codes, but the average sur-\nface pressures were not comparable to WTT data, presumably\ndue to large differences in data acquisition rates between the\nCFD and WTT and the large difference in time-averaging\nwindows. At ? 4? and 8?, a steadier mode was noted\nwhich was not predicted by OVERFLOW, which continued\nto predict a largely chaotic flowfield.\nGiven the comparisons in this validation study confidence\nwas built in the ability of CFD to simulate 1-nozzle con-\nfigurations at all ? angles tested, and high thrust 3-nozzle\nconfigurations at ? ? 8?. The ability to simulate the\nbehavior seen in the high thrust 4-nozzle cases was also\ndemonstrated, but average surface pressure comparisons were\npoor. The ability of the CFD codes to predict the exact\nboundary between steady and unsteady modes for 1-, 3-, and\n4-nozzle configurations was not demonstrated, and in fact\noffered contradictory results in both the LRC UPWT and\nARC UPWT tests for the 4-nozzle ?/? zero configuration.\nThe average surface pressure comparisons were the best for\nthe 1-nozzle configuration and for the steadier runs of the\n3- and 4-nozzle configurations. This correlates to steadier\nflowfields where the large difference in data acquisition rates\nbetween the CFD WTT did not greatly influence the averages\nobtained. Another possible error source may be the grid\nsystems used for each code which were optimized for 1-\nnozzle SRP flow, not for multi-nozzle flows with shear layer\ninteractions.\nThrust dominance and computational costs were also men-\ntioned. Computational costs were high for validation but\ncould be much less for production.\nFuture work for CFD validation would include live rocket\ntests including startup transients, more flight-relevant calcu-\nlations including Mars atmospheric and rocket nozzle gases,\nand an application to flight-scaled spacecraft to better under-\nstand the influence of aerodynamics on stability and control.\nFuture wind tunnel tests could include pressure measurement\ninstrumentation along the model shoulder to help validate\nCFD in that area. More CFD research may be needed to\nproperly define the boundaries between different behavioral\nmodes, as well as an optimization of a grid system for multi-\nnozzle SRP flowfields.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nPieter G.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
