A The number of enrolled students B The course throughput distribution C The grade distribution CCNA courses It consists of large network topology advanced VLSM subnetting interconnection of all given network devices with appropriate cables con\223guration and working with networking services mandatory CLI con\223guration of the network devices and advanced static routing and routing with two different routing protocols V T HE EVALUATION OF THE NEW CURRICULUM This section presents the evaluation of introducing CISCO in the Computer Networks course\220s curriculum We have introduced initial upgrades and curricula improvement with CISCO courses for the last 10 years in the beginning at Faculty of Natural Sciences Studies in informatics and later on at Faculty of Computer Sciences and Engineering after it is established in 2010 In this section we present the evaluation of the last 4 held courses from the study year 2009/2010 onwards Figure 2 depicts the number of the students that attended the course with CISCO or regular curriculum We observe two periods with different program student enrollment distribution That is more students attended the course by CISCO program in study years 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 and less in the last two years If we analyze the percentages of the CISCO students we can conclude that it decreases each year starting from 65 in 2009 to only 17.5 last year This trend happens mostly due to four factors The 223rst is the economic crisis that is although each student pays a discounted price at our academy it is still beyond the limits of a budget of a regular student and the crisis has the main impact Additionally the second reason is due to changes in the courses schedule which impose transferring this course from the third to the second study year in 2012 We concluded that it is very early in the study period and the students do not understand the real bene\223t of attending the course by CISCO program Also changing the course in second year after the establishment of the Faculty of Computer Sciences and Engineering enabled massive attendance and the number of students has tripled Most of these students are those willing to study programming related courses and are not motivated to get deeper in the computer networks The reason is also connected with moving the course in the second year that is there are many other 216dif\223cult\216 courses in the second study year such Data Structures and Algorithms or Databases Last but not least the students fear that the CISCO can migrate its program to new version until they graduate We must note that moving the course from the third to the second study year caused the decrease of the course throughput as depicted in Figure 3 Not only that the number of the CISCO students was greater during the years when the course was in the third study year but the course throughput was much better for CISCO In order to prove that all course changes that we implemented are well designed we analyzed the grade distribution of the passed students which is depicted in Figure 4 We observe very similar grade distribution for both programs despite a small advantage for CISCO students for grades 7 with 6 and 10 with 9 correspondingly This led to slightly better average grade of 7.69 for CISCO students compared to very similar 7.64 for regular students 978-1-4799-3190-3/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 3-5 April 2014, Military Museum and Cultural Center, Harbiye, Istanbul, \Turkey 2014 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference \(EDUCON Page 504 Fig 2 The number of CISCO and regular students by years Fig 3 The percentages of passed CISCO and regular students by years students Figure 3 depicts the results of the evaluation during the years We observe how the grade distribution is also signi\223cantly better for CISCO students That is more than 82 are passing the whole course with the CISCO program and impressive 98 passed the course in 2011/2012 On the other hand regular students throughput varies between the small 28 to modest 47 


Another view of grade distribution that is the average grades for each year is depicted in Figure 5 The results of the evaluation show that CISCO students achieved slightly better grades than regular students especially in the prior years when their number was greater We can conclude that although the CISCO students are allowed to achieve 10 more points the average grade distribution of all years is very similar for both student groups which proves our curriculum Several arguments also con\223rm this conlcusion The CISCO students actually have more topics to cover an extra exam than regular students They are more motivated due to practical challenges and also they are enforced to learn more since they spend money and do not want just to pass the course but gain more knowledge through practical exercises VI D ISCUSSION Tanenbaum and Stallings 19 propose a bottom-up approach for teaching and learning about the computer networks These books are also proposed to our students even more because they are of\223cially translated to the student\220s native language The other approach is the top-down approach which is proposed by Kurose The teachers usually choose the approach they prefer In this paper we presented the integration of these two opposite approaches simultaneously That is CISCO\220s CCNA 1 and 2 approach is top-down and it was a very hard to integrate with the theoretical bottom-up approach The results of the course with the new curriculum as well as with the regular one during several years con\223rm our success Implementation of two CISCO CCNA courses improved the course\220s average throughput of CISCO students spectacularly that is average 91.09 CISCO students passed the course compared to minor 37.84 of the regular students The CISCO students are more motivated because they work with practical equipment they face real problems and 223nally they can continue with CCNA 3 and CCNA4 extend their knowledge achieve a 223nal certi\223cate and 223nd a job more easily The similar grade distribution and the average grade through several years is expected since 200 points two thirds of the points are still from the theoretical part of the course which is obligatory for both approaches for the Computer Networks curricula VII C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Computer science students usually avoid to learn the nonsoftware courses such as the Computer Networks and Data Communications although most of the applications in today\220s broadband world are distributed and acquire the services by the lower network protocols This paper proposes a new computer network curriculum by introducing CISCO CCNA 1 and CCNA 2 courses into the course This change allows the students to choose if they would like to follow the course according to more practical exercises and tutorials instead of the regular which are more theoretical The course evaluation in the period of several years show that these changes improved the course throughput without making the course easier that is the grade distribution of passed students is slightly better for CISCO students The analysis also show that although the Computer Networks course is one of the core courses it should be offered in the upper study years after the students have learned more details about Internet well known application protocols and distributed systems We have concluded the following students obtain better results by learning more practical oriented courses and moving the computer network class in the second study year instead of the third year of study gives worse results When the course is moved to the 223rst or second study year less students understand the importance of practical approach and recognize it as opportunity to get in touch with engineering 978-1-4799-3190-3/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 3-5 April 2014, Military Museum and Cultural Center, Harbiye, Istanbul, \Turkey 2014 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference \(EDUCON Page 505 Fig 4 The grade distribution of CISCO and regular students Fig 5 The average grade distribution through years D The average grade

af\002ne transformation and the X and Y offset parameters computed by the Interpolation Processor and produces as output the warped bands according to the offsets Since offsets generally contain a decimal part various methods of interpolation of data can be used to get the 002nal result The easiest way is to round the offset to a whole number and take the exact value of the resulting pixel as the destination This technique is called nearest neighborhood it is simple to implement but can cause artifacts in the output image especially when very thin features are present Interpolation of the source pixels gives better results many approaches are possible but the most common are bi-linear and bi-cubic interpolations which are both provided However the perfect interpolator would be an in\002nitely long 2dimensional sinc 002lter which is unfortunately not feasible so a windowed version called the Lanczos 002lter is used instead The GPU texture memory already provides hardware assist for bi-linear interpolation In fact accessing the memory using 003oating point coordinates yelds a value which is the weighted average of the four closest pixels with a single memory fetch Performance are identical to using whole numbers and indeed our implementation does not actually distinguish between the two as the nearest neighborhood relies on the bi-linear function by simply rounding the pixel location To further increase performance the destination image is divided in blocks and a kernel operating in parallel on all pixels of a block has been developed A similar kernel was also developed for complex images using two fetches 050the real and the imaginary parts\051 rather than a single one as in the normal case Bi-cubic interpolation is even better than bi-linear as it uses a weighted average of the 16 closest pixels to determine a pixel value so it produces a smoother result However there is no dedicated hardware support in the GPU Fortunately instead of 16 memory fetches a bi-cubic interpolation mechanism can be achieved using just 4 bi-linear lookups by offsetting the sample position within each pixel and weighting the samples correctly as described in This technique has been again implemented for both real valued and complex images by using an appropriate kernel to process a block of pixels of the output warped band concurrently The Lanczos 002lter implementation is based on a windowed version of a sinc 002lter according to the following formulation 050in one dimension\051 L 050 x 051  032 sinc\050 031x 051 sinc\050 031x=a 051 if 000 a  x  a 0 otherwise where a is a positive integer and it is an input parameter of the tool 050typical values are between 2 and 5\051 The two dimensional version is simply the product of two one dimensional 002lters along the orthogonal axes i.e L 050 x y 051  L 050 x 051 001 L 050 y 051  where we assume that a is used for both the horizontal and vertical functions In the implementation the value a de\002nes a square region of size 2 a  centered on the location in the slave image de\002ned by the X and Y offsets and the af\002ne transformation if the af\002ne transformation includes a rotation the square is also rotated A kernel has been developed to evaluate the 002lter within the square region using integer coordinates for the source pixels and applying the proper coef\002cient given by the above expression All contributions are then summed to obtain the 002nal value for the warped image pixels As the Lanczos coef\002cients are already normalized no further adjustment is needed after accumulation Since offsets are in general 003oating point numbers the Lanczos 002lter has to be potentially evaluated for any value between 000 a and a  However to improve performance the horizontal and vertical 002lters coef\002cients are pre-computed with 1024 samples between any whole value This shall be compared to the expected precision of the estimated sub-pixel displacement which is no more than 1/30 of a pixel and therefore it is considered more than adequate To further increase the throughput the developed kernel performs the evaluation of the 002lter for many pixels in parallel Unfortunately given that each pixel has a different offset it is not possible to share contributions between adjacent pixels in the warped image so a separate thread is run for each of them In case the warping function is a rigid translation then the 002lter can in principle be separated into an horizontal and vertical one thus achieving a huge saving in running time However given that the transformation is almost never so simple this optimization has not been implemented 6 E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS The co-registration toolchain has been applied to many reallife satellite images from both optical and SAR sensors In this section two examples are presented to verify it against two main metrics accuracy and timing performance In both cases we relied on synthetically generated slave images in order to be able to correctly verify the obtained results In a 002rst experiment a sample high resolution 050 14320 002 11760  168 Mpixels\051 3-bands optical image is used as the master On the other hand the slave image is derived from the master with a known distortion applied The distortion is a third order polynomial with 006 9 pixels in the horizontal direction and 006 3 pixels in the vertical one An equally spaced grid of 100 002 100 pixels has been de\002ned where each master patch is 64 002 64 pixels and the search area size in the slave is 128 002 128  The matching processor is run using the sub-pixel option with accuracy of 1/100 of a pixel and the interpolation processor is used with three different algorithms Linear Triangulation 050LT\051 Quintic Triangulation 050QT\051 and Least Square Polynomial 050LSP\051 with degree 3 Table 1 gives the RMS error in pixels in both the horizontal and vertical directions for all cases As it can be seen the error is always very low and LSP is the most accurate with the QT being better than LT as expected Figure 5 shows the generated horizontal offsets by the LSP in the graph for each pixel of the image a bright value represents a positive x offset 050with white representing the maximum positive offset\051 and a dark one a negative offset 050with black the maximum negative\051 Co-registration timing performance are veri\002ed on two sets of images in the 002rst one images are 20000 002 20000 050400 Mpixels\051 with two bands while in the second they are smaller at 8000 002 8000 05064 Mpixels\051 but with 12 bands each 9
