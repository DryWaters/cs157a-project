This is facilitated by \ndata analytics systems in addition to availability of \nmassive amounts of surveillance data. In order for \ncompanies in the aviation domain to better make sense \nof current and historical data, and make predictions \nusing descriptive behavior, a scalable analytics service \nis needed. In response to BCA’s need in this nature, \nwe built a data warehouse that will aid making critical \ndecisions. \nIn 1992 the Federal Aviation Administration \n\(FAA program to provide flight plan and \ntrack information from the NAS to airlines and other \norganizations in real-time or near real-time depending \non the need. The feed, called the ASDI, is a product of \nthe Enhanced Traffic Management System \(ETMS TFM Center located at the \nWilliam J. Hughes Technical Center \(WJHTC distributes the \nASDI data stream to a tier of vendors who in turn \ndistribute it to their clients [1 nBoeing AATM has been archiving Aircraft \nSituation Display to Industry \(ASDI the present time, there is not an easy \nmechanism to perform analytics on the data. The data \nset is large and stored as compressed XML messages. \nTable 1 shows the number of ASDI messages for \nAugust 8, 2009. Table 2 shows the number of \nsupporting records for the main message set. If one \nassumes that the information in the tables above is \ntypical for a given day, two years of data amounts to \napproximately 5.5 billion messages and 19 billion \nsupporting records. Clearly, for any analytics to be \n  I8-2 \nuseful over this dataset a data management solution is \nrequired. \n Table 1.

Data would be extracted from operational \ndata sources, transformed, cleaned reconciled, \naggregated, and summarized in preparation for \nwarehouse processing [2]. \nThe tool of our choice for data management \nsystem has been IBM’s InfoSphere Data Warehouse \nas it manages large data sets by offering extended data \nmining and analytics support. The data warehouse is \nimplemented by a backend DB2 


database [3]. For near \nreal-time ASDI feed consumption, message routing, \ntransformation, and publish/subscribe capabilities, we \nused WebSphere Message Broker [4] and WebSphere \nMQ [5]. SPSS Modeler by IBM has been our choice of \npredictive data analytics tool that provides data \ncollection, statistics predictive modeling, and \ndeployment capabilities [6]. Front-end visualization \nfor business intelligence support was provided by \nIBM’s Cognos BI tool [7]. \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: In nSection 2, we present related work, in Section 3, we \nexplain process of ASDI correlation, in Section 4, we npresent the overall system architecture including the \nphysical and conceptual modeling of the data nwarehouse as well as consumption of ASDI feed. In \nSection 5, we discuss some of the data representation \nand loading issues we encountered and optimizations \nwe realized. Section 6 tackles a basic use-case where \nwe perform analytics predicting distinct traffic volume \nwithin a boundary defined by the user. The final nsection contains concluding remarks and future work. \n2. Related Work \nBig data means data that cannot be handled and \nprocessed in a traditional manner. It will be so large as \nto not fit on a single hard drive,as a result,it will be \nprocessed on a number of cores [8]. \nThere are number of articles and books on big \ndata analytics, data warehousing and OLAP \ntechnology and related research issues. While some of \nthese research focus on physical and conceptual \ndesign, others target maintenance issues and stream \nprocessing. However, to the best of our knowledge, \nthere is no work done similar to ours in the aviation \ndomain where operational real-time or near real-time \nsurveillance data is turned into a warehouse enabling \ncritical decision making and predictive analytics in the \nliterature. \nResearch matters pertaining to data warehousing \nand OLAP technology can be found in various \nresources [9-13]. A significant amount of research in \nthe database community has been dedicated to the \nphysical and logical design of data warehouses [14]. \nWith their research, Lujan-Mora et al. [15] \npresent physical modeling of data warehouses using \ncomponent and deployment diagrams of UML ?. \n  I8-3 \nIn their article, Arumugam et al. [16] describe \npurely-push based, research prototype database \nsystem called DataPath, which is a "data-centric" \nsystem. In the DataPath system, all data production, \nincluding system I/O, is undertaken asynchronously, \nwhether a receiving operation is ready for the data or \nnot ?. \nLi et al. [17] concluded that IOP systems in high \nperformance stream processing not only enforce order \non input streams, but also require that query operators \npreserver order. This order preserving requirement \nconstrains the implementation of stream systems and \nincurs significant performance penalties, particularly \nfor memory consumption. They introduced a new \narchitecture for stream systems, OOP that avoids \nordering constraints, freeing stream systems from \nburden of order maintenance by using explicit stream \nprogress indicators. \nIn traditional DBMSs, it was assumed that the \nDBMS is a passive repository storing a large \ncollection of data elements and that humans initiate \nqueries and transactions on this repository. Abadi et al. \n[18] called this a human-active, DBMS-passive \n\(HADP opposite a \nDBMS-active, human-passive \(DAHP nmonitoring applications is to alert humans when \nabnormal activity is detected. According to them nmonitoring applications are very difficult to \nimplement in traditional DBMSs. First, the basic \ncomputation model is wrong: DBMSs have a HADP \nmodel while monitoring applications often require a \nDAHP model. \nBorkar et al. [19] discusses the industry trends \nand compares monolithic parallel SQL database \nsystems with variations on the Hadoop stack, \nconcluding that the latter is preferable. They also \nhighlight the fact that open-source stack \nimplementators have forgotten almost everything \nabout single system performance, focusing solely on nscale-out. \nIn their article, Rusu et al. [20] introduce \nGLADE, a scal¬able distributed framework for large nscale data analytics. The main abstraction at the core \nof GLADE is Generalized Linear Aggregates \(GLA are based on the notion of user-de?ned aggregates \n\(UDA database system with specialized aggregation \noperations. \n3. ASDI Correlation \nIn this section, we introduce ASDI data and the \ncorrelation process. \nThe purpose of the Correlator is to tag flight plan \nand track messages from multiple Air Traffic Control \n\(ATC nidentifier called the FLIGHT_KEY. The consumer is \nfree to process updates for each flight without the noverhead of deciding which messages are associated \nwith each flight. This is a powerful benefit because neach ASDI message does not always, in and of itself, \nprovide enough information to identify the flight it is nassociated with. \nThe ASDI data feed is a continuous stream of \nmessages delivered over a TCP/IP network socket \nfrom an upstream ASDI vendor. A data distribution \nserver was created to receive one stream from nEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University \(ERAU data feed produced by ETMS is a \nstream of data packets containing Zlib compressed \nXML documents of ASDI messages with a binary \nheader. ASDI messages can be flight plan related data, \noceanic reports, or Host track reports. \nEach NAS center identifies a flight plan by its \nown three character alphanumeric Computer 


nIdentification \(CID npass through, although, flight plan related messages in \nthe ASDI stream do not include the CID once a flight nbecomes active. Often a center will create a new flight \nplan and CID for an existing flight, only to cancel one \nof them shortly thereafter. It is not always clear if the \nsecond flight plan was meant to be an amendment or if \nit is an additional flight. Sometimes, a message for an \ninactive flight may be missing a CID, which adds to \nthe confusion. \nSome centers will even change the origin of an \ninternational flight to a local facility once it enters \ntheir control. Anchorage Center will often issue a \ndeparture message for an arriving active flight over \nCanada, even though it departed hours before from the \nmainland US. \n3.1 Design nThe overall design of the correlator is to identify \neach unique flight plan that is filed in the NAS and to n  I8-4 \nexamine each ASDI message to deduce which flight a \nmessage is associated with. The centers operate nindependently of each other to assign their own CID, \nso the CID alone is not sufficient to correlate messages \nfrom different centers. The ETMS will also assign a \nunique CID to regularly scheduled flights before they \nare filed by a center. This is compounded by fact that \nflight plan related messages do not include the CID \nonce a flight becomes active. Excluding the CID for \nan active flight should not be a problem since one \nwould not expect more than one flight in the air with \nthe same flight number, but it happens often. The \nopposite can also be true where messages arrive \nwithout a CID, but the departure message or updated \nflight management record have not arrived for the \nflight, potentially producing multiple candidates nNew flight plans can be created midflight, hours \nor even a day before the flight departs. \nAs the correlator identifies a new unique flight \nplan it generates a new unique FLIGHT_KEY record \nand stores a set of key parameters such as the aircraft \nidentifier, flight status, departure center, aircraft type, \ndestination etc. that together make the record unique. \nAs new messages arrive for a flight the parameters are \nfilled in and updated as the flight progresses. The CID \ndoes provide useful information and may directly \ncorrelate a message if the CID for a center is already \nstored for a flight plan. In particular the CID can \nprovide an indication of the status of a flight. \n3.2 Correlation Process for Position-Related \nMessages \nFor Host track and oceanic reports, if there is a \nflight plan with a matching aircraft identifier and CID, \nthen the message is correlated with that flight plan. \nOtherwise, a list of all active flights with a matching \naircraft identifier, as well as departure point and \ndestination for oceanic reports, is compiled. If there is \nonly one matching flight then the message is \ncorrelated with that flight. If there are multiple \nmatching active aircraft identifiers then the flight plan \nwith the closest matching last known position is \ncorrelated. \n3.3 Correlation Process for Flight Plan-Related \nMessages \nThe correlation process for all flight plan related nmessages is based on key parameters. For each \nmessage a list is generated of all flight plans with \nmatching aircraft identification, departure point and \ndestination. If the flight plan related message, other \nthan an RT message, contains a CID, it should be for a \nflight that is not active and an attempt is made to find a nmatch by CID. RT messages are different because \nthey typically always contain a CID and the flight’s \nstatus is indicated by the flight status field in the RT \nmessage. All other messages that do not contain a CID nshould be for active flights. There should not be more \nthan one flight active at the same time with the same naircraft identification, however there are some seen \nthroughout each day. The process is complicated by nmessages that are partially complete or contain \nincorrect data. \nBecause each center has its own CID, the list of \npossibilities is further reduced by comparing the \ndeparture and arrival times for reasonable matches. \nFlight plan, amendment and boundary crossing \nmessages contain a coordination point and time that nmarks where and when the aircraft should be handed \noff to the facility producing the message. These nmessages are matched to the most likely flight in \nwhich the coordination time falls within the bounds of nthe departure and arrival times, if known. Therefore, \neach flight record contains one or more tailored flight \nplans from one or more centers. Flight plan \ncancelation messages are matched to each center’s ntailored flight plan. Flights are considered complete \nwhen all center flight plans are canceled or an arrival \nmessage is received. \nOnce a single flight plan record is correlated to \nthe incoming message the FLIGHT_KEY is set. If \nmore than one flight plan record still matches then the \nincoming message and possible matches are logged \nand the FLIGHT_KEY is set to UNCORRELATED. \nIf the incoming message cannot be matched to an \nexisting record then a new record is created for the \nflight plan and a new FLIGHT_KEY is assigned to it nThis process generally works for most of the flight \nplan related messages. \n4. Architecture \nIn this section, we present the overall system \narchitecture including the physical and conceptual \nmodeling of the data warehouse as well as processing \nof archived and near real-time ASDI feed. \nFigure 1 illustrates the overall physical structure \nof the system. A TCP/IP live ASDI stream is \nconsumed by a message ?ow deployed on WebSphere \n  I8-5 \nMessage Broker where messages are sorted and \npushed to related queues based on their 


message types \nin WebSphere MQ.Another message ?ow  deployed \non Message Broker pulls from the related queues and \npopulates the tables in the SURVDB database. Each \nqueue in WebSphere MQ maps to a table in the \nSURVDB database. As tables are populated with raw \nXML messages in the SURVDB database, the XML \nShredder, which is comprised of a set of stored \nprocedures parses out raw messages and puts their \ncontent per tag into separate tables in the SURVDB \ndatabase. Tables are partitioned across the external \nhard drives, each 2TB of size This summarizes the \nprocess of near real-time message ?ow into the \ndatabase.  \n \nFigure 1. Overall System Architecture \nThe end user interaction with the system is as \nfollows: The end user is provided with a number of \npre-set models, created and stored in SPSS Modeler, \npresented on Cognos, and available on a demilitarized nzone \(DMZ nDeployment Services. SPSS Modeler connects to the \nSURVDB database and pulls the data describing the \npast behavior. Upon receipt of new parameters, SPSS \nModeler invokes the scoring service to make \npredictions using descriptive behavior and presents \nthe results back to the end user on Cognos. \nThese processes are detailed in Sections 4.2 and \n4.3. \n4.1 Physical Modeling \n Figure 1 illustrates the overall physical structure \nof the systems where we used total of four servers. \n• Server-1, is a Dell T3400 computer with \n4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Intel \nCore 2 Duo processor where Infosphere \nWarehouse was installed along with DB2 \non top of Windows Server 2008 R2. The \nserver is connected to four external drives, \neach 2TB of storage size.  \n Server-2, is an IBM HS21 Blade Server \nwith 4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core \nIntel Xeon 5130 processor where DB2 is \ninstalled on top of Windows Server 2008 \nR2, handling the XML shredding.  \n• Server-3, is a Dell M4500 computer with \n4GB of RAM and 64-bit quad-core Intel \nCore i7 processor where WebSphere \nMessage Broker is installed along with \nWebSphere MQ for near real-time \ncorrelated ASDI data consumption from \nTCP/IP stream and brokering. The server \nruns on Windows Server 2008 R2.  \n• Server-4, is a Dell T5500 computer with \n16GB of RAM and 64-bit six-core Intel \nXeon X5650 processor where SPSS \nModeler and Cognos BI tools along with nSPSS Collaboration and Deployment \nServices are installed. The server runs on \nWindows Server 2008 R2.  \n4.2 Conceptual Modeling of Database \nSince the incoming ASDI messages in XML, a \nstandard format for the exchange of semi-structured \ndata, we first translated them into an equivalent \nrelational schema. Some approaches for translating \nXML documents into a relational database can be \nfound in the literature, on DTD and XSD [21 22], or \nother alternatives, but insufficient emphasis is given to \nthe problem of determining cardinality of nrelationships, which instead has a primary role in \nmultidimensional design [24]. \nWe generated database tables based on classes \ncreated from the schema definitions for the correlated \nASDI data. There are nine main database tables \ncorresponding to an ASDI messages as listed in \nTable 1. \nThere are eleven supporting database tables that \nhold portions of the data from the main ASDI \nmessages as listed in Table 2. \n  I8-6 nEach database table contains a \nUUID,SOURCE_DATE, and SOURCE_TIME \nelement. The UUID element ties records in the \nsupporting database tables to the corresponding ASDI \nmessage in the main database tables. The nSOURCE_DATE and SOURCE_TIME elements \ndetermine what DB2 partition table to place the data \nin. With DB2 range partition tables \(RTP several tables. This way query and data \nload performance is increased and large datasets are \nbetter managed nPartitioning is important for various reasons. \nFirst, the query optimizer is aware of the partitioning nstructure, and can analyze predicates to perform \npartition exclusion: scanning only a subset of the npartitions instead of the entire table. Second, each \npartition of a table can have a different storage format, \nto match the expected workload ?. \nWhen a record is written to a database table, DB2 \nuses the SOURCE_DATE and SOURCE_TIME to \nwrite the record to the correct table. When a query is \nmade with a specified range, DB2 will only check \nthose tables within the range. If the data is ever \ndeployed on another database provider, other means \nfor partitioning may need to be deployed. In the worst \ncase, one can use the original implementation where \nactual physical tables were created for each range. \nEach main database table also contains a \nFLIGHT_KEY element. The FLIGHT_KEY enables \na user to retrieve all messages that correspond to a nparticular flight. \n4.3 Processing of ASDI Data \n The system was built with two separate data \nflows in mind n• Processing of archived ASDI data of two \nyears.  \n• Processing of near real-time of ASDI data.  \n \nBoth processes included correlation and database \nloading steps. \n4.3.1  Processing of Archived ASDI Data \n First we will go over the process of adding \nASDI data to the database. The process consists of two \nsteps. In the first step, the ASDI data must be \ncorrelated. In the correlation process, messages are \ncorrelated to flight plans and assigned a unique \nFLIGHT_KEY as described in Section 3. For those \nmessages that cannot be correlated, the \nFLIGHT_KEY is assigned the value \nUNCORRELATED. Given the FLIGHT_KEY, a user \ncan obtain all messages corresponding to a given \nflight. Figure 2 shows the block diagram for \nconverting ASDI data to correlated ASDI data. The \nASDI Playback application is a server that accepts \nTCP/IP connections from a 


client. When a client \nconnects, the Playback Server begins streaming ASDI \ndata to the client. Currently there is no flow control \nbetween the server and the client. The Server \npublishes at a fixed message per second rate. In \naddition, no timing consideration is made based on the \nsize of the message when publishing The Playback \nServer reads a set of ASDI files where each file \nrepresents a day of messages. The output of the \ncorrelator is a set of four files for each input file. There \nis a file containing all flight related messages, a file \ncontaining all track information, a file containing all \nmessages that could not be correlated, and finally a \nfile containing all messages that contained errors. \n   \nFigure 2. Creating Correlated ASDI Dataset \nIt currently takes about thirty minutes for the \ncorrelator to process a day of ASDI data. Given that \nwe have collected approximately two years of ASDI \ndata, it would take approximately fifteen days to \nprocess the entire set. Recovery methods are in place \nin the event that one of the applications stops. In order \nto recover from a failure, the correlator periodically \nsaves off a checkpoint of the correlation data. In the \nevent of a failure, the Playback Server is restarted \nfrom the time of the last checkpoint. \nIn the second step, the correlated data must be \nprocessed and loaded into the database. Figure 3 nshows the block diagram for processing the correlated \nASDI data and loading it to the database. The napplication sequentially processes a list of files \ncontaining correlated ASDI messages. The files can be \nin one of two formats, binary or text. The binary \nformat is the format used by the correlator. Content of \nthe binary file consists of a repeating pattern of header \n  I8-7 \ndata followed by compressed payload data. The text \nformat is used when errors are found processing the \nbinary data. If an error is encountered while nprocessing a file, an error is logged. A user would then \nexamine the message, make any required corrections nand create a new file where the first line contains the \ntext "Modified Message" and the second line contains nthe modified message. \n  \nFigure 3. Writing Correlated ASDI Messages to \nthe Database \n The process for adding archived ASDI data of \ntwo years to the database is as follows:   \n• The next file in the list is opened.  \n• The next message block is read.  \n• If the message block is a binary format, the \nfile is uncompressed.  \n• The message block contains all ASDI \nmessages received in the last 30 seconds or \nup to a maximum of 150 messages.  \n• The message block is unmarshalled using \nJaxB.  \n•  Each message is processed and written to a \ncomma-separated value \(CSV supporting tables.  \n• If there are no more records in the file all \nCSV files are written to the database using \nthe SQL load command.  \n• The next file is opened \(step 1 the next \nmessage block is read \(step 2 approaches regarding stream \nprocessing can be found in literature. These \napproaches broadly deal with order of input in stream \nprocessing. Li et al. ? made two categorizations: \nin-order processing \(IOP order processing \n\(OOP  streaming \nimplementations which were intolerant of disorder \nand expected data to arrive in a strictly time-oriented \nfashion. They described OOP as next generation \nsystems which implemented flexible and efficient \nquery operators that can accept data out of order. Our \napproach is insensitive to input order, the messages \nreceived. \nThe approach for real time processing uses IBM \nMQ, IBM Message Broker, and XML Shredding. \nFigure 4 shows the block diagram for near real-time \nprocessing. \n  \nFigure 4. Near-Real Time ASDI Processing \nThe Uncompress Compute Node connects to the \ncorrelator via a TCP/IP socket. The data is a ncontinuous stream of correlated ASDI data consisting \nof a header and compressed ASDI data. The node \nreads the header file to determine the size of the \ncompressed data block. The compressed data is then \nuncompressed resulting in an XML document \nconsisting of correlated ASDI messages. The \nhierarchy of the document is shown in Figure 5. The \nXML document is then forwarded to the Message \nSplitting Node. \n \n  \n \n  \n  I8-8 \n  \nFigure 5. Hierarchy of Correlated ASDI XML \nDocument \nThe Message Splitting Node extracts individual \n"msgCorrelated elements from the document. Each \nelement is then wrapped to create a valid document \nand forwarded to the XML Shredding Node. \n The XML Shredding node is responsible for \nadding each message to the SHRED_QUEUE table in nthe database. Each document maps to one of the nine \nmessage types discussed earlier. Each message maps \nto a main table with up to four supporting tables. There \nis a corresponding XMLTABLE statement for each \ntable The format for the XMLTABLE statement is: \nXMLTABLE\(xqueryExpression PASSING \nxmlSource COLUMNS columnName ncolumnDataType PATH pathXqueryExpression, \n shredding where a stored procedure \nfetches the XML document and executes the \nXMLTABLE statements. Several columns require \nspecial processing to place the data into "Host" \nformat. The result of the shredding process is a record \nthat is inserted into the appropriate table. \n4.4 Client Interface \nThe client interface uses IBM Cognos Report \nStudio. Report Studio is a web application for creating \nreports. Users can tailor reports by specifying criteria \nsuch as date range, aircraft id, departure airport, or \narrival airport. Report Studio 


supports several outputs \nincluding HTML, XML, PDF, Excel, and CSV. \nReports are available for all nine messages and can \ncontain links allowing users to obtain additional \ninformation. Figure 6 is a view of Actual versus \nPlanned", illustrating flight plan overlaid with \ntrajectory. This report shows waypoints for the flight \nplan \(in red in \ngreen Report \n \nIBM Framework Manager is used to create the \ndata package used by Report Studio. Framework \nManager is a metadata modeling tool that allows a \nuser to define data sources, available data items, and nrelationships between data items. If the source is a \ndatabase, Framework Manager uses the relationships \n I8-9 \nto determine the necessary table joins when \nconstructing the queries. \n  \n5. Discussion \nIn this section, we discuss some of the issues we \nencountered regarding data representation, and \narchived data loading. We also present the \nperformance optimizations we realized. \n5.1 Data Representation \nAccording to the FAA’s ASDI schema , several \ndata elements can be represented in more than one \nform. Either a separate column in the database for each \nform is required or the data could be stored in the \nFAA’s Host computer system format with a \ncorresponding column containing the format code. In \neither case, some user requests may require multiple \nqueries to obtain the information. For readability, the \nchoice was to save the data in Host format. Here, two \ncolumns are required. One column contains the format \ncode and the other column contains a string \nrepresentation of the value. Tables 3,  4, and 5 show \nthe possible formats for altitude, fixes, and speed, \nrespectively. \nTable 3. Possible Formats for Altitude  \nFormat Representation Example  Comment \na d d OTP/250  Aircraft is flying VFR-ON-Top at 25,000 feet \nd \(d d 25,000 and 26,000 feet \ne ABV/\(d d d 250/DAL/260  Aircraft will fly at altitude flight level 250 to the DAL \nfix to flight level 260 \ng VFR VFR Aircraft is flying VFR \nh VFR/\(d for Fixes \nFormat Representation Example  Comment \na dddd\(L d L Latitude/longitude \nb aa\(a a a a a a radial 300, \ndistance 040 \nTable 5. Possible Formats for Speed  \nFormat Representation Example  Comment \na d d 0.85, for example application used SQL \ninserts to add messages to the database. To reduce \noverhead between the client and the database server, \nthe messages were pushed in batches. At first, it took \nover seven hours to push an entire day of ASDI \nmessages to the database.  \n5.2.1 Optimization - 1 \nThe original application created the SQL nstatement by appending elements to a java String. \nTiming tests revealed that it was taking over five hours n\(of the seven hours nStringBuilder class was used to create the statements. \nThis reduced the time from five hours to less than 20 n  I8-10 \nminutes. The reason for the order of magnitude in \nincreased performance is due to the fact that java \nStrings are immutable. Every time you append to a \nString, a new instance is created. Hence, continually nappending to a large String will result in very poor \nperformance. \nImplementing the first optimization dropped the \ntime to process a day of data to a Implementing the \n?rst optimization dropped the time to process a day of \ndata to hundred and twenty minutes, resulting in time \nsavings of 71.4%. \n5.2.2 Optimization 2 \nThe software was ported from IBM BladeCenter \nHS21 \(with 4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon \n5130 processor with4GB of \nRAM and64-bit quad-core Intel Core i7 processor run on Windows Server 2008 R2.  \nPorting the software to a faster platform reduced \nthe time to process a day of data to thirty minutes. This \nhighlights the fact that database performance is highly \ncorrelated to the hardware it runs on.  \n5.2.3 Optimization - 3 \nNowadays, DBMS support standard bulk loading \nutilities for batch loading data. This approach is useful \nin traditional periodically updated data warehouses, in \nwhich the data load usually represents a large number \nof rows [28]. \nIn our case, data was originally pushed into the \ndatabase using the insert statement. By using the load \ncommand, the time to push a day’s worth of data ndecreased to from XXX minutes to fifteen minutes. To \nsupport the load command, the application was \nmodified to write CSV files for each table. When the \nentire day of messages had been processed, the load \ncommand pushed each CSV file into the appropriate \ntables. \n5.2.4 Optimization - 4 \nTo limit the size of the tables the original code \ncreated multiple tables for each table type. For queries, \nthis approach puts the burden on the application to \nquery multiple tables when a range crosses several \ntables. DB2 supports the concept of RPTs. Here, when \nadding a record, one or more columns are used to \ndetermine the table. With RPT, the user is not required \nto make multiple queries when a range crosses a table \nboundary. With RPT, the time to process a day’s \nworth of data actually increased to thirty minutes. \nHowever, this additional ?fteen minute cost per 


day of \npartitioning enabled us saving signi?cant amount of \ntime and resources during database queries n5.2.5 Optimization - 5 \nThree changes were made to the database:   \n• Range periods were changed from a week nto a month.  \n• The automatic table space resizing was \nchanged from 32 MB to 512 KB.  \n• The buffer pool size was decreased.  \n \nThe changes decreased the time to process a \nday’s worth of data from thirty minutes to twenty \nminutes. The application of all optimizations reduced \nthe total processing time of a day’s data from over \nseven hours to twenty minutes, resulting in total time \nsavings of 95.2%. \n6. Basic Use-Case \nIn this section we present a basic use-case where \nwe perform analytics predicting distinct tra?c volume \nwithin an AirspaceVolume of Interest \(AVOI sector, center airspace volume of interest, boundary \nor airway segment boundary or airway segment at any \npoint in the future in 15 minute buckets. \nNarrowing the time gap between data \nacquisition and acting on a business decision \nbased on the datais referred to as near real-time nbusiness analytics [29]. With this use-case we aim \nto alert on congestion due to ?ow control areas or nweather if certain thresholds are exceeded and \npropose alternate ?ight paths.  \nFor this use-case we executed SPSS Modeler, \nwhich provides a way of building predictive models \nthrough a graphical user interface, utilizing many \nadvanced modeling techniques. In addition, it also has \nthe ability to perform various data processing \noperations to better prepare the data to be modeled. \nThe model that the user designs is shown in a stream \nformat in Figure 7, which allows for easy visualization \nof the model flow. \nIllustrated in Figure 7, Node-1 pulls in the \nTRACKINFORMATION table which contains \naircraft position data using SQL Node-2 determines \n  I8-11 \nthe boundary of the model stream using the bounding \nbox corner coordinates Node-3 combines the \nSOURCE_DATE and SOURCE_TIME to a \ntimestamp that can be understood by the modeling \nnode Node-4 computes the interval that the database \nentry will fall in. The time interval is 15 minutes. \nNode-5 defines the target and input fields needed for \ncreating the model. Node-6 handles the creation of the \nmodel Node-7 \(the golden diamond the predictive part of the model. Node-8 \nproduces a graph based off of the model results. \n \nFigure 7. The Use-Case in Stream Format in SPSS Modeler \n \nExecution scenario is as follows: the user enters a \nbounding box coordinates along with a specific date \nfor prediction. SPSS Modeler then performs data \nprocessing on the database, counting relevant records \noccurring in the past. SPSS Modeler will then return \nthe predicted value along with likelihood estimations. \nProvided descriptive behavior of the past data, next \nyear’s flight count within the user-defined bounding \nbox is predicted with certain likelihood. \n7. Conclusion and Future Work nCurrently the raw ASDI data is compressed and \nuncorrelated to flight plans. There is no mechanism in \nplace to extract meaningful insight from this data. \nWith the ASDI data correlated to flight plans and \nstored in a structured fashion, meaningful data can be \nextracted. The extracted data can then be used as input \nfor analytics tools. \nThe nature of raw ASDI data is such that the \nsheer volume of raw surveillance data makes nperforming analytics very di?cult. On average, over \nseven million ASDI messages are received per day. \nTotal storage for one day of surveillance data is \napproximately 1GB. Based on the number of mes-\nsages and the storage requirements, a scalable data \nwarehouse approach was implemented. Once the \ndatabase was populated clients could ”slice and dice” \nthe data in ways that were not possible when in the \nnative format. Also,by using range partitioned tables, \nnot only did query performance increased, but table \nsize restrictions were no longer an issue. This allows \nfor years of data to be stored in a single database.  \nThe raw ASDI data runs through a series of \nprocesses before it can be used for analytics. The raw \ndata is sent through a correlation process, where \nmessages are correlated to flight plans, and then saved \nin a compressed file. A Java application then runs \nthrough these files where they are uncompressed, \nunmarshalled, and then inserted into their designated \ndatabase tables. \nOnce the stored historical ASDI data had been \ninserted into the database, a separate series of \nprocesses were put into place for inserting real time \ndata. This strategy takes the compressed data blocks \ndirectly from the correlator output, and prepares them \nfor insertion into the database. The individual \nmessages are separated and placed in a raw-XML \nform into a queue table in the database. Stored \nprocedures are then run against tuples in the queue \ntable in a process called XML shredding.  \nUsing XML Shredding to store real-time ASDI \ndata allows for the database to be constantly updated \nwith the most up to date information. This will allow \nfor analysis in near real-time to discover current trends \nas they are happening. Additionally, aviation queries \ncan be issued on the most current information. \nThe entire ASDI archival service has been \ndeveloped, tested, and deployed entirely on ncommodity hardware. This hardware allows for easy \nmaintenance and scalability as the database grows. It nalso allows for easy integration into existing \nlaboratory infrastructure and networking. The current \n I8-12 \nhardware architecture is made up of only three \nphysical servers.  \nWe plan on using aviation weather 


information in \nthe analytics process to attain more accurate \npredictions. Among the potential data sources for this \ncapability are meteorological reports \(METAR  RAP  predictions \nhave been made and potential bottlenecks have been \ndiscovered, we would like to perform prescriptive \nanalytics to further propose solutions. These will be \nour next steps. \n8.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
