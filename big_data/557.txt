radars operating over the L-band microwave spectrum are often used as sensors for estimation of vegetation biomass land surface topography and surface deformation surface soil moisture and polar ice sheets thickness Monitoring of these 
parameters is essential for gauging the Earth's ecosystem Because of restriction on the mass and size of a radar sensor that can be deployed on a small aircraft/spacecraft the surface resolution with which these 
essential earth parameters can be improved using this technology by forming interferometric baselines between nodes The Expandable Reconfigurable Instrument Node ERIN will provide a semi-closed loop system solution for a variety 
of sensors The ERIN baselines a reconfigurable processing technology with required memory to allow on-board processing of science data Standardized interfaces are provided to allow for interfacing to attitude control instrumentation such 
as Global Positioning Systems GPS and Inertial Measurement Units IMU A communications device will be added to the node that would allow for node-to-node communications 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION  2

INTRODUCTION Present technology Sensor webs utilize multiple individual sensors ERIN Background A requirement for a small lightweight reconfigurable instrument data system has been identified through collaborations with various instrumentors The concept of ERIN an Expandable Reconfigurable Instrument Node was produced to fit that need and to provide small individual sensors access to on-board processing that would not otherwise be possible The following set of requirements was identified as being critical to the success of ERIN FPGA-based therefore reconfigurable in-flight if needed Expandable standardized interfaces will allow additional components to be added Wireless communication GPS Inertial Measurement Unit Each sensor acts individually No advantage taken of multiple sensor nodes in sensor web Sensor web limited by spatial resolution and individual sensor sensitivity ERIN technology Multiple sensors configured in a web Sensors act in coherence Processing of data combined across multiple nodes Enhances spatial resolution and sensitivity Produces more meaningful scientific experiments ERIN-WSS Goal Hardware specifications would meet requirements for a variety of instruments Algorithms could be changed to meet processing needs Low overhead for configuration of on-board devices Standard enough to use on multiple instrument platforms The key requirement is to take advantage of the reconfigurability of FPGAs to fit a wide variety of small individual sensors Position and pointing knowledge are key to meeting the web sensor strand application Therefore the wireless communication GPS and IMU tags are optional but necessary for this most ambitious of applications WSS Background Although the Web Sensor Strand WSS technique will only be shown for two nodes in this development program it will be relevant for many nodes that need to act in coherence This is a new capability that enables small platforms to act as a large sensor It is limited to targets with radar returns that are not changing in time such as subterranean layers of material The ERIN-WSS goal is to enable relevant science measurements with microwave instruments radars and radiometers using small platforms to create a large transmitting as well as collecting aperture The phase lock loop maintained between nodes must remain in lock to form multiple baselines from a common wave front Each baseline must be translated to a common coordinate system for image processing to work If the phase difference between nodes drifts more than 1/4 wavelength then the phase lock will not be robust This can drift because of uncertainties in the absolute position of the antenna phase center in space global positioning system or GPS  or the relative position Inertial Measurement Unit IMU measuring roll pitch or yaw of the beam relative to the absolute position sensor INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION The ERIN monostatic sensor operates at 1.26 GHz with a nominal pulse width of 30 nsec selectable The instrument consists of a single channel Fig 1 2

The Anechoic Chamber Test demonstration of the monostatic radar status was imminent in December 2007[6 The radar sensor brassboard and U-slot ERIN antenna and prototype ERIN were integrated in weatherproof boxes for testing on the lab bench with a delay line and 2-way propogation in the anechoic chamber under ERIN breadboard trigger control From there 2-way transmit/receive pulse analysis for delay spreading dynamic range and signal to noise characterization will be done RF data storage in bench test equipment BTE such as a digital oscilloscope For the interim replay from the scope through a Graphical User Interface\(GUI will enable and help troubleshoot the capability to have a quick-look at verifying and validating data In Figure 2 the 50 foot tower test configuration is described that will test ERIN in a relevant noise environment The monostatic radar will need to be extremely fast to gate out the clutter from surrounding reflective sources e.g buildings and fences The tower configuration requires that ERIN store and tag the data and temperature telemetry and return it to the operator via a serial cable RS-232 An ethernet core will upgrade the data extraction capability in subsequent versions of ERIN Tagged data storage and ingest to the image processing computer will be pursued in parallel in the ERIN development laboratory using the 6 x 6 ERIN-Lite breadboard When the real-time troubleshooting of the front end with the scope  and the real-time algorithm integration and testing on the ERIN-Lite including the Ethernet controller algorithm and packetizer is complete then the monostatic radar system will be tested end-to-end ERIN-WSS ALGORITHM ERIN-WSS Algorithm The flow chart Figure 3 illustrates how the ERIN Web Sensor Strand is collected tagged buffered enabling the image processing as work to be addressed in years 2 and 3 of the ERIN-WSS program First the ERIN triggers and tags a radar pulse in the transmitting sensor radar Second the pulse in our model is represented in the frequency domain as a carrier frequency surrounded by modulation Third staying in the frequency domain we have modeled the propagating to the far field through the test antenna step 3 to the target and reflected scatter back to the source node and eventually other nodes in the model step 4 The reciprocal process step 5  the antenna receives the returning pulse and it becomes important to return to a time-domain representation In step 6 ERIN gating opens the receiver to accept the scattered energy To enable the image processing computer to do Multibaseline image processing\(multiple pulses multiple node locations ERIN must tag and buffer the return pulses ERIN triggers and tags the next pulse at the pulse repetition frequency PRF programmed by the user In the image processing computer multiple baseline image processing algorithms will reside that take the GPS time and position tags and the azimuth and elevation beam pointing tags and reconstruct an array of multiple pulse returns from multiple node locations In the monostatic demonstration the position doesn't really change but it does establish a stationary node calibration of expected delay dynamic range and signal to noise This calibration will be useful in processing node 2 returns when the node 1 node2 communication is established for the web sensor strand A predictive model for the expected return at multiple baselines is being developed by the team The monostatic response was predicted for the short range of the 30 foot anechoic chamber and 71 foot slant range.[7 5
