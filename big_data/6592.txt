  Mining Association Rules to Facilitate Structural Recovery Wu Ren 1,2  1 School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 201203, China 2 Shanghai Institute of Process Automation Instrumentation 081024014  fudan.edu.cn   Abstract In order to facilitate software maintenance, data mining techniques such as clustering and association rule mining can be used for extracting meaningful information from source code. Although in the past the techniques have been employed in independent or combinatorial ways for various maintenance activities, none of them combines dynamic information and visualization method to assist structural analysis. In this paper 
we present a solution for enhancing the recovery process. First execution traces are obtained using dynamic analysis and result matrices mapping between traces and method calls involved in the traces are generated. Based on the obtained matrices clustering algorithm is applied to product an initial system structure, and association rule mining technique is also applied to build the associations among the clusters. Second, the obtained dynamic dependences based the analysis are demonstrated using visualization, in which software entities and associations are represented as nodes and edges, respectively. Thus the relations among clusters can be depicted, which are helpful for evaluating clustering quality and conducting potential refactoring. Through 
applying the approach on an actual application system, initial analysis is presented and the execution results can be used to guide further research work Keywords- Dynamic Analysis; Scenario; Association Rule Mining; Clustering Algorithm; Use case I   I NTRODUCTION  Program comprehension is an essential activity in software maintenance. Without prior knowledge, reverse engineers are difficult for understanding a legacy system implementation and system’s functional intents. For most systems, the available documents usually are out of date or even non-exist, the only reliable resource for reverse engineers to know domain content is the source code [1 I n  t h i s c a s e  d a t a m i ni ng t e c hni q u e s  
such as software clustering and association rule mining often became very valuable for producing high level overview and interrelations through system entities, and thus facilitate legacy systems understanding For an object-oriented system, clustering is an approach to group similar objects into the same group in terms of the standard of similarity. Objects within the same cluster would have higher similarity than in different clusters [2 o m e  clustering techniques such as performing architectural decomposition rely not only on static analysis of source code but also on dynamic analysis to provide meaningful insight on the structure of software systems. By dynamic analysis, the roles of software entities playing on the system and the style of 
their interactions might be determined, which is helpful to understand how the system functionalities are implemented Association rule mining as another data mining technique can find previously unknown nontrivial patterns and relations from frequent item sets, which is also employed to mine rules from the generated trace matrices. According to these rules, the item elements involved in the traces are located to the relevant clusters, the edges connecting different system entities are established with the weight values of association rules, which represent the directed dependencies among sets. By doing so the relations can be erected and visually displayed II

The assumption is that a system, in its final version, has nine classes which from c1 to c9 Its each snapshot contains the classes of its different version. Frequent 3-itemsets are calculated during the process of association rule mining. For the item set of c2  c4  c5 the support is 37.5%, If the minimum support is set to 30% and the minimum confidence to 100%, we can generate two rules c2  c4 005 c5 and c2  c5 005 c4  which indicate a common change relation among these three classes. The measurement of the common change among classes is to analyze generated strong rules, i.e. a strong probability with 100% confidence indicates a common change on the two sides of the rule TABLE I  E XAMPLE OF ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  Trans Set of classes as item set Id 1 c1, c4, c5 Id 2 c2, c4, c5 Id 3 c2, c3, c4, c5 Id 4 c1, c2, c4, c5 Id 5 c1, c2, c3, c6 Id 6 c3, c5, c6, c9 Id 7 c1, c2, c8, c9 Id 8 c1, c3, c4, c7, c8  In order to extract association relations between the items the visualization technique is utilized for presenting the information to quickly display and compare the dependences of the items. For instance, the association relations for rules c2  c4 005 c5 and c2  c5 005 c4 are shown in Figure 2. Where an arrow indicates a dependence direction and the thickness of the edge stands for the weight of the association  Figure 2  An example of association graph IV  O UR A PPROACH  We assume that the relation extraction using rules from dynamic traces is feasible. The associations obtained by mining rules reflect some dynamic behavior information, which are difficult to generate using static structural analysis alone, offer the maintainers a grasp of structure relations and further help them evaluate clustering quality and restructure the system      Figure 3  Overview of our approach We outline the proposed process in Figure 3: the first step scenario creation collects the runtime behavior events about the legacy system, and the following phases are to cluster the program entities involved in dynamic traces and take the set of traces as input to form a item set using apriori association rule algorithm to find associations among execution events. The last steps are the dependence analysis and the result clusters are visual displayed. And an inference step for deciding on whether it is necessary to modify the system structure will be decided in terms of the generated clusters and the obtained strong association rules A  Scenario selection We combine a specific experiment to illustrate the implementation process. For a certain feature of “draw” in the drawing tool JHotdraw project, there are a feature-specific scenario set is designed according to the knowledge about the application domain, available documents, and user’s guide of the subject system. In this experiment, we consider the following selection Scenario 1  start, draw a rectangle, stop  Scenario 2  start, draw a polygon, stop  Scenario 3  start draw a line, stop Scenario 4  start, draw an ellipse, stop

  B  Trace-classes matrix Generation We assume that each scenario correlates to one trace, and each trace is generated by triggering relevant features. Thus a trace for every selected feature is generated by executing the instrumented system. The execution traces are generated in the form of entry/exit listings of object invocations. We collect the classes involved in the traces as follows TABLE II  T HE SCENARIOS AND RELEVANT CLASSES IN THE TRACES  scenario Classes in each trace Trace1 000\003 AbstractCommand, UndoableTool, CompositeFigure, ToolButton RedoCommand, ZoomDrawingView, ZoomDrawingView Abstract_ Command, ZoomDrawingView , CollectionsFactoryJDK12 000\003 Trace2 000\003 ZoomDrawingView, FigureAttributeConstant, StandardDrawingView CollectionsFactory PolygonFigure FigureChangeEvent AWTCursor Bounds, ZoomDrawingView, CollectionsFactoryJDK12 000\003 Trace3 StandardDrawingView, StandardDrawingView, CompositeFigure AnimationDecorator, FigureChangeEventMulticaster, PolyLineFigure AbstractTool, AlignCommand, HandleEnumerator, CreationTool StandardDrawingView, ZoomDrawingView Trace4 FigureAttributeConstant, AbstractTool AttributeFigure AbstractFigure SelectionTool, UndoableTool, AttributeFigure, AnimationDecorator FigureAttributeConstant, ZoomDrawingView ,AbstractCommand C  Concept lattice representation We use concept lattice tool to identify feature-specific classes and common classes with concept lattice construction and visualization. Feature-specific classes are more important in understanding functional intents. The generated concept lattice in terms of the data of execution traces is shown in Figure 4 where the feature-specific concepts are gathered at the lower part of the lattice and common classes are clustered at the upper region, respectively We investigate whether these common concepts as a cluster for acting as mere utilities. These concepts are also referred to as omnipresent objects. In the experiment we do not distinguish between utilities and common parts of the feature that occur in traces and group them as a cluster. These common components exist in almost parts of a system and influence the clustering quality if clustering them with other components. Therefore, a feasible way is to deal with these concepts of the system by grouping them into a separate cluster, and then use clustering approach to group the rest concepts  Figure 4  Concept lattice representation of the traces and classes D  Applying the Clustering Algorithm A problem is that each trace will produce a great deal events even in such a small experiment, e.g., 330 classes are generated in Trace1 and one scenario may call the same class several times. This times degree can be distributed by clustering analysis but be regarded the same by concept lattice. Possibly the times of the same class called in the traces can impact on the structure, so we use clustering technique as next analysis approach. Eventually, a trace-class matrix is built with the rows represent the 65 non-repetitive classes and the columns are the four traces which a part of data is shown in Table II Our clustering groups show great difference in number of classes, e.g., if we cluster these classes into seven groups, in which the number of classes in one group will up to 43 Considering the designed use uses to realize the draw feature there are similar functionalities on the process, so a few clusters likely contain most of code entities. A part of generation clusters are shown in Table III TABLE III  A PART OF GENERATION CLUSTERS  Clusters Classes Cluster1 Singlefigureenumerator Polygontool Polygonfigure Cluster2 AttributeFigure ColorMap FigureAttribute FigureAttributeConstart Cluster3 Selectiontool Polylinefigure Linefigure Myselectiontool Selectareatracker Cluster4 AbstractFigure StandardDrawingView FigureChangeEvent   E  Applying association rule mining We use the Apriori algorithm with min_support value of 30% and confidence value of 100%, and then result in 30 association rules \(partially showed on Table IV TABLE IV  A PARTIAL OBTAINED ASSOCIATION RULES  Rules Supp Conf DragTracker 005 AbstractTool 0.3 1.0 RedoCommand  AbstractCommand 005 ToolButton 0.4 1.0 RelativeLocator 005 BoxHandleKit 0.3 1.0 AbstractCommand 005 RedoCommand 0.4 1.0 RedoCommand 005 ToolButton 0.5 1.0 ToolButton 005 RedoCommand 0.5 1.0  We consider these obtained strong association rules are meaningful for clustering analysis and program understanding because the rules reflect the relations among classes. In particular, we will introduce how we utilize these rules to improve the clustering quality in the section of Case Study V  CASE  STUDY A  Target system We use a small-scale industrial system OnlineBank m one industry partner as our case study. We hope to recover system’s structural relationships by clustering and mining association rules. Obviously, the selection of the use cases is 
274

  important for creating a wide range of functionality in a legacy system. The coverage achieved by the scenarios takes great influence on the dynamic approach result. Therefore, to derive a balanced set of use case covering various aspects of the system is necessary for whole structural recovery. Each selected use case corresponds to a set of with execution scenarios and each scenario is an object of clustering and its execution traces are the objects’ attributes, thus a dynamic matrix is generated The transaction set can be constructed according to the transactions as execution traces and the items as the invoked methods in the traces. We consider build a connection line between two objects if there are a strong association rule exists and build two or more lines if two or more rules exist between So the thickness of edges shows the accumulating relations That is, the thicker of the edge shows, the more links between two cluster and versa vice. Finally, we get all these relations among these clusters in terms of generated association rules and our tool displays these data with visualization method Figure 5 shows these clusters associating with arrows to indicate a dependency exists, and the thickness of the edges stands for the association weight. Each cluster contains relevant methods which display the associations within differ groups or same groups. We implement a prototype tool based on XRay 12  an  o p en s o u r ce to ol t o i n v e s tig ate th e de tai l in  a c e r t a i n  cluster by clicking the cluster icon. \(shown in Figure 6  Figure 5  Dynamic association graph We compare the great deal number of obtained rules by setting a different min_support value. Our experiment shows that the adjustment setting produces different influence to the result. As the minimum support value increases, there is a clear downward trend on the number of rules \(shown in TABLE V TABLE V  T HE NUMBER OF OBTAINED RULES IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT MINIMUM SUPPORT DEGREE  Min_sup 40 50 60 70 Rules 321 234 140 87  Furthermore, we can analyze different cluster association relations for understanding system’s structural information.  In this paper, we first group together the similar functionalities to produce clusters. Within a same cluster, association rule mining helps discover associations between items that reside within the same cluster, which discover rules focused on the method calls of each cluster separately. While in different clusters association rule mining is useful for finding the associations Since we perform the association rule mining for all the clusters, the result is to generate rules and to discover frequent item sets concerning all the clusters in total The primary case study proves the effectiveness of clustering and association rule mining. In the case study, each edge is expressed through the weight and indicates potentially association dependencies, and the weight value is inferred by each erected association rules. However, the approach might be improved by setting various weight levels. For instance considering the following two rules i1  005œ\000\003 i2 and i1   i3  005œ\000\003 i2 the weights should be set with different value. This weights difference has not been distinguished in the article, we consider this as our future work  Figure 6  Concrete methods of a certain cluster In Figure 6 we can see the connection lines among the concrete system components, where each line stands for a generated strong association rule. The arrow represents the dependency direction from an entity to another. And the nodes are the system’s entities and the edges represent the associations \(summed up in terms of the collected rules\ among the entities. That is, generated graph is based on the exploration of the association relations. The more strong rules between two entities exist, the more thickness of the edges display. By summing these edges, accumulated connections will be formed with thicker lines as shown in Figure 5 B  Clustering Evaluation As discussed above, we assume a premise on the issue that two different clusters merging depend on the thickness of the edges, which indicates the association degree. That is the reason of why results of association rule mining can help clustering. The rationale for doing so is based on the idea that strong rules between objects can indicate the dependency relations. Regarding the above case study, there is reliable evidence showing these rules can reveal the details of the system. As the proposed work is to obtain dynamic events and related rules from these events, it is suitable for structured or object-oriented system, or even for both design methods Our approach first groups trace events according to their similarity. Such groupings can be evaluated by comparison to the original developers’ perceptions. This system expert of OnlineBank manually put these methods to the relevant groups and depicted the dependency relations among the methods in these packages. By doing so, a set of relationships for all the methods were indicated and basically the expert made a clear mapping for the system. Therefore, our approach can be evaluated with the manual standard established by the expert as the “ground truth 
275 
275 


  We use the precision and recall metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our clustering approach. Precision is the percentage of the correctly group  cluster 001 cluster_standard  cluster and recall is the percentage of group  cluster 001  cluster_standard  cluster_standard Since the number of clusters in terms of our clustering approach is seven but the number of the “ground truth” is five, so we compared five relevant packages with each other, including the number of method calls and the dependency relations among them. Finally we obtained an experiment compared data in Figure 7  Figure 7  Precision/recall without association rules complement From the Figure 7 we can see the clustering results shown with low precision value, especially, the recall is lower. The results using our clustering approach alone are seven categories formed, while the standard results are five Categories in terms of ground truth. We observe the data in Figure 5, and find that Cluster3 and Cluster4 have strong associations between them Cluster2 and Cluster5 have also similar strong rules, and Cluster5 is more independent with other clusters than with Cluster2. Therefore, we decide to restructure these clusters with the aid of association rules, that is, removing and merging relevant methods according to obtained association rules Through erected association rules standard, it is possible to infer the weight value of each edge. Based on this idea, the two clusters are merged into one cluster, and the similar approach is also applied to Cluster3 and Cluster4. We compare the conclusion with the "ground truth" and then investigate whether the conclusion is right  Figure 8  Precision/recall with association rules complement Figure 8 shows the experiment data of the adjusted methods which have been merged from two different clusters into one according to the calculated dependency relations.  Compared with the results of Figure 7, we can see the precision /recall have a great improvement As discussed above, we assume a premise on the issue that whether two different clusters merging or not depend on the thickness of the edges between two nodes, which indicates the association degree differently. That is the reason why the results of association rule mining can be employed to help the clustering analysis. The rationale is based on the idea that strong association rules between objects can indicate the connection degree for dependency relations. Regarding the case study, there is reliable evidence showing these rules can reveal the details of the system implementation. In addition, the obtained dependency relations can be displayed using a graph by visualization technique and can be compared among item sets. As the proposed work is to obtain dynamic events and mine related rules from these events, so it is suitable for structured or object-oriented, or even for both design methods To evaluate the quality of our association rule mining techniques we need to define a benchmark. As introduced above, by interacting with the system expert of OnlineBank we obtain a “ground truth” answer for knowing the actual relations among system units. Therefore, we compared the generated associations with the benchmark. We consider two influence factors on the evaluation: First, the dynamic approach to collect rules does not achieve 100% coverage of the system Obviously the choice of scenarios is one of the primary factors that affect the results, so this should be further elaborated Second, the number of obtained strong association rules in terms of different minimum support degree will also influence the experiment results  Figure 9  Precision/recall of strong association rules with OnlineBank Figure 9 summarizes the experiment results. The horizontal axis represents the minimum support values adopted for rules mining, and the vertical axis presents the precision and recall in comparing the dependency relations among methods with the benchmark. We can see that the approach improve the precision with a decrease in recall at the higher minimum support threshold. How to get a better performance of the approach will be our next-phase work VI  D ISCUSSION  Our preliminary evaluation also reveals research challenges in advancing our approach First, we believe that the only structural analysis is not sufficient for program comprehension, especially for an objectoriented system. One solution to this problem is to utilize dynamic analysis to obtain the dependency information. In particular, we investigate whether association rules can be complemented on the erected dynamic relations and we consider the following research questions RQ1: Can association rule mining be employed to find the dependence relations among program elements involved in the trace events which reflect the actual running behavior RQ2: Following RQ1, can we find effective measure to evaluate the degree of associations to related clusters 
276 
276 


  RQ3: Can different clusters be observed in distinct settings and can help us for system refactoring We conduct an exploratory study to investigate the above questions by means of a case study. The analysis techniques that we have explored in this work prove to be useful for addressing these research questions. Obviously, mining association rules is able to help reveal hidden dependences among program elements in source code. The answer to RQ2 is that the measures of associations are to summarize the relations by summing up the numbers of strong association rules. This solution might be too simple and should be solved with a better measure. We consider it as one future work to improve. The answer to RQ3 is that we use the visualization technique comparing the associations among related clusters and program elements, it is possible for suggesting system refactoring by investigating the thickness of lines between two nodes Second, the large volume of information and complexity of dynamic information makes it hard to understand the system runtime behaviors and infer higher level of information. In our experiment, the choice of use cases is one of the primary factors that affect the experiment results. So it is better to derive a balanced set of use cases just like the experiment results shown in Section IV. But this may require a great deal of manual decision to choose distinct use cases for yielding better results. Obviously, complete coverage is not necessary However, this is necessary for understanding complete structural intents. Adopting “just enough” use cases will help us improve the experiment result effectively Third, utilizing strong association rules to build the dependencies to depict the relations among inter-clusters and intra-clusters and deal with system entities and associations as nodes and edges is an exploratory study. However, the work needs to be improved by setting various weight standards and to build appropriate metric parameters. A proper weight should reflect the invoked times of program elements and the association values among elements with the goal to identify the important types of dependences VII  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  The main goal of this research is to provide maintainers an overview of the software and the relations in order to facilitate structure analysis. Therefore clustering and association mining technique are employed. By doing so, reengineers are able to get a rough and quick view of a legacy system at first, and then further utilize rules to identify hidden relationships among different program units such as method calls and classes etc Besides, the approach uses clustering technique to study dynamic dependencies under maintenance to determine the roles of software entities play in a system. So it is possible for maintainers to understand the system at a higher level. For association rules mining, use case scenarios are mapped to trace transactions and rules are extracted from the events through a number of scenarios. Strong association rules can identify dependences by setting a threshold which greater than a minimum support threshold value and a minimum confidence threshold value. Thus these relations can help find issues in system construction which likely need a potential refactoring Overall, the contributions of this paper are i proposing an approach for program comprehension through association rule mining analysis ii demonstrating the visualization technique comparing the dependences within clusters and system entities Our future work mainly includes: \(1\ combining dynamic analysis with system’s structural model, e.g. program-element dependencies for enriching the semantic information \(2 erecting the metric evaluation for different association rules and setting right weights for each edge correlation, and \(3 conducting systematic empirical studies on the choice of the appropriate parameters for the proposed approach R EFERENCES  1  Dapeng Liu, Andrian Marcus, Denys Poshyvanyk, Vaclav Rajlich Feature location via information retrieval based filtering of a single scenario execution trace. 22nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering \(ASE 2007\, November 5-9, 2007 Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

algorithm shows higher efficiency However since F lach's algorithm finds new rules that the developed algori thm doesn't generate, they can be used for generating h elpful tips or reminders  VI  C ONCLUSION  The WANDA system was developed in conjunction with the University of California Los Angeles Computer S cience and the UCLA Ronald Regan Medical Center WANDA monitors health-related readings such as blood gluc ose weight blood pressure etc and analyzes sensor re adings and patient profile data for improving the quality of care and preventing emergency situations In this study, we developed WANDA, a three tier rem ote health monitoring system and focused on increasing ease of use in order to improve patients system adherence  The developed system applies EM-based data discretizati on and Apriori rule learning algorithms and finds associat ion rules using collected sensor readings with dynamic slidin g windows We assumed that sensor readings from patie nts are Gaussian mixture and quantize continuous featur es and applied Apriori algorithm which efficiently finds r elated data using support values The designed algorithm minimizes the number of action items and reorganize s series of tasks for maximizing information gain In this work we applied the developed algorithms t o 1117 data sets from 21 patients with diabetes enrol led in the intervention arm. Patients are required to measure their blood sugar up to three times a day and answer four quest ionnaires daily The experimental results show that the devel oped algorithm can reduce the number of tasks by up to 7 6.19 with minimum support 0.95 minimum confidence 0.95  minimum conditional probability 0.85 and maximum ti me window size of 5 days Compared to our earlier stud y 37   the EM-based discretization helps improve confidenc e levels of first order logics and predict further events. A s the Apriori algorithm has excellent scale-up properties 45   t he developed algorithm can be applied to the remote pa tient with low complexity Future studies will investigate and validate the significance of the obtained first order logic rule s in this paper. To make the first-order logic richer to redu ce required patient tasks dynamically, more data association ru le mining techniques will be exploited and maximize the condi tional probability and confirmation. In addition, patient survey data will be combined to predict adherence rate in advan ce, based on their perception and experience of remote health  monitoring technologies  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by NIH/National Library of Medicine Medical Informatics Training Program Grant T15 LM07356 The authors would like to thank Nancy Lee  Rose Healy, Florence-Joy Figueras, Jane Lee, and To ni Ann Riveros for their help in patient recruitment and a dvice Tannaz Moin was an endocrinology fellow in the UCLA  Department of Medicine Division of Endocrinology Diabetes  Hypertension and is now a health service s research fellow supported by VA Office of Academic Affiliations Health Services Research and Developm ent through the Health Services Fellowship Training Pro gram TMP 65-020\, VA Greater Los Angeles  R EFERENCES  1  CDC Centers for disease control and prevention http://www.cdc.gov/. 2012 2  Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research G roup.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to ef“ciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
