Unlike traditional algorithms, the multi-relational proposals allow mining directly multiple tables, avoiding the costly join operations. In this paper, is presented a comparative study involving the traditional PatriciaMine algorithm and its corresponding multi-relational proposed, MR-Radix in order to evaluate the performance of 
two approaches for mining association rules are used for relational databases. This study presents two original contributions: the proposition of an algorithm multi-relational MR-Radix, which is efficient for use in relational databases both in terms of execution time and in relation to memory usage and the presentation of the empirical approach multirelational advantage in performance over several tables, which avoids the costly join operations from multiple tables MR-Radix, multi-relational data mining, association rules mining frequent itemsets, relational databases I   I NTRODUCTION  
Traditional data mining algorithms, such as Apriori [1 and FP-growth [2  ar e app l ied to s e ar c h f o r  p a tt er ns fro m a  single table extracted from a target database. For this reason the application of these algorithms on databases is conditioned to the necessity of having all the data available in that single table. Another possibility, till keeping to the stated objective, is to apply such techniques to the creation of a universal table that is the result of joining all the tables Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that that operation can result in a universal table having a size that would make the application of traditional techniques unviable. In an effort to 
overcome the negative aspects of said strategies, an alternative was developed which consists of applying said algorithms to a central table which is made up of attributes that summarise or aggregate the information found in other tables. Nevertheless, this technique has the disadvantage of generating tables having many attributes and data repetitions 3   Multi-relational data mining algorithms emerged to enable the extraction of multiple relation patterns, with efficiency and efficacy, without the necessity of joining the data into a single table [4    S a id a l g o r i t h m s  m a d e  p o s s i b l e the extraction of knowledge in situations where, due to their 
semantic relevance, it is important to maintain the structure or relationship of the multiple tables [6 7    Pr o p o s e d m u ltirelational algorithms for the principal data mining tasks can be found in literature: association rules analysis classification; clustering analysis [4 Th es e te ch n i qu es a l l o w  the extraction of knowledge from important application areas, such as web search mechanisms, marketing, molecular biology, business data analysis, and bioinformatics, among others [8 However, for multi-relational data mining in large databases, such algorithms were not efficient due the 
difficulty of allocating enough memory for all data structure used for this algorithm to represent the database. To bypass the scalability problem in multi-relational data mining, the MR-Radix was proposed, a multi-relational algorithm, which has a data structure called Radix-tree that compresses the database in the memory. To demonstrate the efficiency of this algorithm, this work presents a comparative study of MR-Radix and its corresponding multi-relational, the traditional PatriciaMine This study presents two original contributions: the MRRadix multi-relational algorithm proposal and the empiric 
presentation of advantages of the multi-relational approach for mining various tables This work is organised in the following manner: section II lists the principal concepts about mining association rules traditional and multi-relational; section III presents a comparison between PatriciaMine and other algorithms section IV presents the proposed MR-Radix algorithm section V presents a comparison between PatriciaMine and MR-Radix algorithms; lastly, section VI presents conclusions about the work

II  T HEORY S UBSTANTIATION  Data Mining can be defined as being the use of computational techniques to extract knowledge from a set of data which, generally, is large enough to make human analysis impracticable [9 A s s o ci ati on ru l e s  w h ich h a v e th e  objective of discovering associative patterns from databases can be found among these techniques. The classic example that illustrates mining association rules is called çmarket basket analysisé, which identifies associations between items so that, frequently, the presence of some items implies the presence of others [10   An association rule can be seen as an implication X 002 Y with X and Y being sets of items. Such sets are called itemsets, also commonly referred to as k-itemsets, in which k is the number of items that said set has. That pattern indicates an association between the antecedent set \(X\ and the consequent set \(Y\, so that the occurrence of X implies the occurrence of Y. Two interesting measures, called support and reliability [10 a r e u s ed  t o o b tain an d  q u an tif y  association rules The support represents the association rule frequency that is, indicates the percentage of concomitant occurrence of the X and Y sets in the database. The reliability measurement indicates the frequency in which the occurrence of X set items implies the occurrence of Y set items. Said measurement expresses the validity of the association rule X 002 Y [10   A  Mining association rules algorithms In this section, some of the mining association rules algorithms found in literature are presented. The best known are: Apriori w h i c h use s a çc a ndi da t e ge nera t i o n a ndtesté \(CGT\ and the FP-growth [2 w h ich a d o p ts th e  pattern-growth \(PG\ paradigm The FP-growth algorithm uses an FP-tree data structure which creates a subtree for each recursive call and favours the mining of frequent itemsets from dense databases [2 Differently to FP-growth, the TD-FP-growth algorithm does a top-down processing, it being more efficient in the use of time and memory Some algorithms, such as H-Mi  a nd OpportuneProject [1 m a k e u s e of t w o t y pes of s t ru c t u r es  to mine dense and sparse databases. Because the structure to do the mining depends on the type of base, said algorithms use heuristics to assess the density of a database and choose the best strategy. In the case of dense databases, tries are used as this type of base generates few branches and intensifies mining efficiency. For sparse databases, structures based on arrays are used as these bases generate many branches in the tree, significantly increasing the size of these structures and, consequently, the time needed for processing  13  The PatriciaMine [14 gor i t hm i s b a s e d o n  t h e  PG approach, but has a superior performance in comparison to the FP-growth. This is due to the use of a more optimised structure called Patricia-trie \(Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded In Alphanumeric\ or Radix-tree. Said structure is efficient in its mining algorithm performance and in its use of memory. Moreover, the Patricia-trie structure has a high compression capacity which reduces needed space for its allocation in memory, when compared to the FP-tree standard, by up to 75% [14 T h e st r u c t u r e e n a b l e s a good performance in dense and sparse databases as the nodes in them are compressed, thus needing a smaller memory space in which to store the tree The PatriciaMine is one of the most efficient mining association rules algorithms existing in literature, having also a better performance than the OpportuneProject algorithm and is considered as being one of the most advanced patterngrowth approach algorithms [14    16 F o r t h o s e reasons, that algorithm was studied in this work B  Multi-relational mining association rules Traditional data mining algorithms, such as Apriori and FP-growth, seek patterns from data that are ordered in a single structure like a table or file. To apply these algorithms in relational databases, the data from a set of relations must go through a pre-processing stage, in which they must be reunited in a single table by means of a joining or aggregating operation Although this proposal is possible and sufficient for some applications, the use of traditional mining algorithms in multiple tables can produce unsatisfactory results, for example, jeopardised algorithm performance, since a joining process could generate a table with many registers when the extraction is done from large databases, as well as the appearance of inconsistencies or loss of information during the data pre-processing [4   Multi-relational mining is the most recent approach which aims to: overcome the difficulties that are found when applying traditional algorithm; and enable direct pattern extraction from multiple relations, without the necessity of transferring data to a single relation   5   T h i s w o ul d a voi d costly joining operations and semantic losses caused by the representation limit of a single table The first viable multi-relational mining proposals go back to Inductive Logic Programming \(ILP\, having techniques based on pattern representation from first order logic [3   with its main representative being the WARMR algorithm   O t her e x i s t i n g  I L P al gor i t h m s ar e t h e FARM E R 19 and the RADAR bo t h  pr opo si ng p e r f or m a nc e improvements of the WARMR The extraction of multi-relational association rules can also be done with graphs. To do this, mathematical theories are used to identify the set of sub-graphs that occur a determined number of times [21  T h e A G N  2 2 a l g o r ith m   also based on Apriori, was one of the first solutions to use a graph mathematical theory for the extraction of frequent patterns. As from then, other techniques surfaced Ö such as FSG  t h at a i m  t o  i m p r o v e p r oc e s s  pe r f or m a nc e  O n  t h e other hand, algorithms like the GBI  pro po se he u r i s t i c techniques that produce approximate solutions though with a better efficiency in the task of finding frequent patterns Another strategy for the extraction of multi-relational association rules is based on traditional algorithms, such as Apriori and FP-growth. Those algorithms are adapted to multi-relational data mining as their strategy is more

complex for pattern processing. The presentation of some samples of multi-relational algorithms follows One example of the multi-relational algorithm is the MRFP-Growth [2 sed  o n F P gr o w t h  I n a fi r s t st a g e  i t  finds local frequent patterns from each of the tables and, in the next stage, these patterns are verified to obtain multirelational patterns. Another example is the Apriori-Group 26 w h ich is b a s e d  o n  th e A p ri o r i  B y m ean s o f th e  clustering obtained with this algorithm, data redundancy errors, deriving from the junction operations of multiple tables, are corrected The Connection algorithm ha s a be ha vi o u r w h i c h i s  analogous to the MRFP-growth, is also based on the FPgrowth and was initially idealised for use in data warehouses The ConnectiomBlock [28 is a m o d i f i c a ti o n o f th e  Connection algorithm to consider the block concept, which consists of a set of table registers that share the same value of a certain identifier. Another algorithm, called ConnectionBlock i s c a pa bl e o f do i ng m i ni ng association rules in tables having quantitative attributes, by means of transforming these data into classes or range of values Another algorithm is the AprioriMR [29   an  ex ten si on  of  the Apriori, for the mining of multi-relational association rules, adjusting data structures and processing stages to be used in relational databases. The GFP-Growth [3 gor i t h m does the extraction of multi-relational patterns based on the functionalities of the FP-growth and on the clustering concept III  C OMPARISON B ETWEEN THE P ATRICIAMINE AND OTHER A LGORITHMS  As a comparison, a graphic in Fig.1 is exhibited, showing the execution times of the PatriciaMine and OpportuneProject algorithms for a database having approximately 50 thousand registers, called Pumsb. For a better visualisation of the graphic, a logarithmic scale was used for the axis Y, corresponding to the time of execution Graphic in Fig. 2 shows the execution time of the PatriciaMine compared to recent algorithms having a similar performance. The comparative results were obtained by consulting the IEEE Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  website T h e gra p hi c i n  Fi g  3  sh o w s a comparison, between PatriciaMine and other algorithms, of the amount of occupied principal memory space needed to do the mining Although the algorithms show proximate execution times, the PatriciaMine excels with its smaller amount of principal memory space needed to do the mining, as illustrated in Fig. 3 That positive characteristic has a direct relationship to the Patricia-trie data structure which, more efficiently, represents the set of frequent items in the memory. On the other hand the Patricia-trie is capable of partially overcoming the problem of database sparsity as it compresses a representation of the database. Therefore, this structure is an alternative for relational database mining, be they dense or sparse   Figure 1  Graphic of execution times of the PatriciaMine and OpportuneProject algorithms [1    Figure 2  Comparative graphic of the execution time of the PatriciaMine CT-PRO and FP-Growth-Tiny algorithms  Figure 3  Comparative graphic of occupied memory space of the PatriciaMine, CT-PRO and FP-Growth-Tiny algorithms IV  T HE D EVELOPED W ORK   M R R ADIX A LGORITHM  The MR-Radix algorithm proposed in this work is based on the PatriciaMine algorithm which can extract multirelational association rules from large relational databases The algorithm uses the Patricia-trie data structure which has a better algorithm performance and reduces the amount of used memory space by up to 75%, when compared to a FPtree [14 The proposed algorithm extracts frequent itemsets by means of the top-down strategy, making the processing be done in a global structure, which improves the performance of the algorithm as it is not necessary to construct intermediate or temporary structures. Moreover, the MRRadix, same as the PatriciaMine, goes through the tree in an iterative manner, which also improves the performance compared to recursive algorithms

A representation of the itemsets from a multi-relational data mining is more complex as they have to store more information than the itemsets from a single relation Therefore, in this work the itemsets use a proposed technique, called Fusion of Secondary Items \(FSI\ capable of relating the multi-relational patterns so as to avoid the necessity of doing onerous junction operations The FSI technique permits relating items from different tables. The operation consists of gathering all the frequent items from the tables involved in the mining process that have the same Transaction Identi\002er \(TID\[23   Fig. 4 shows a database, as an example, where the primary table is the Patient table and the secondary one is the Admittance. Highlighted lines have the same TID so therefore, correspond to the same patient. During the construction of the tree, the items of the admittance are aggregated or fused to the frequent items of their respective patient, and are used to construct the Radix-tree V  C OMPARATIVE S TUDY B ETWEEN P ATRICIAMINE AND M R R ADIX  The PatriciaMine mining association rules algorithm was used for comparative purposes as a representative of a traditional approach and the MR-Radix algorithm as a representative of the multi-relational approach. Tests were done on a basis of real data, called Sistema de InformaÁ„o e Vigil‚ncia de Acidentes do Trabalho SIVAT \(Work Accidents Vigilance System\ which catalogues all work accident occurrences in a city in S„o JosÈ do Rio Preto interior of the S„o Paulo State. The data was collected and registered by the organ which is responsible for the followup of that type of accident. Table I shows descriptive information Ö tables or relations, number of registers and attributes Ö from the database used in the tests  Admittance   ID_Admit TID Hemorrage Unconsciou 0201 011 Yes Yes  0202 012 No Yes 0203 012 No Yes 0204 013 Yes Yes      n   1 Patient TID Name Sex 011 Joh n M 012 Mary F 013 Caesa M   Figure 4  Sample of Fusion of Secondary Items  TABLE I  D ESCRIPTION OF THE SIVAT  D ATABASE  Database Reports Quantity of registers Quantity of attributes SIVAT Form 32,336 38 Form_cid_10 64,873 3 Form_part of body 35,624 2  Type of machine 859 3  Occupation 1,237 3  The equipment used to host the algorithms and do the tests was a microcomputer having an Intel Core2 Quad Q8200 \(2.33 Ghz\ processor, a DDR 2.4 gigabyte principal memory on a 250 gigabyte hard disc, SATA standard transfer rate of 3.0 Gbit/s and 7,200 rpm \(rotations per minute\. The equipment had Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 system software, besides a Java J2SE 1.6 Developing Kit from the Netbeans 6.7.1 Developing Environment and the SGBD Database Managing System Mysql 5.1 It is worth noting that, different to MR-Radix that can be directly applied to multiple tables, the PatriciaMine traditional algorithm needs a pre-processing stage to join these tables. The comparative study then took into account the computational cost of the joining operation when using the PatriciaMine traditional algorithm. Fig. 5 schematically shows the criteria adopted for this comparative test To do the joining operation of multiple tables, the PatriciaMine algorithm uses a type of junction called èfull outer joinê to list the data from all the involved tables. The resulting list of that junction contains all the registers of the tables participating in the operation, with all not-coinciding values being referenced with a ènull A  Execution time comparison The first analysis is about the execution time of the MRRadix and PatriciaMine algorithms to judge the performance of mining association rules tasks in relational databases Respective times of execution were measured during the application of the algorithms on a SIVAT database. Fig. 6 shows execution time values of said application The SIVAT database has a reasonable volume of data The data structure used by the algorithm is robust, needing more time to conclude the processing. Even so, results at first show that the MR-Radix algorithm, despite handling complex multi-relational patterns, had a greater efficiency than its corresponding traditional, PatriciaMine, when applied to the SIVAT repository. This indicates that multirelational mining was shown to be the most advantageous way to prospect for data as the proposed algorithm was two times faster than the PatriciaMine, as can be seen in Fig. 6

 Figure 5  Scheme of a comparative study between MR-Radix and PatriciaMine  Figure 6  Execution time graphic Ö MR-Radix and PatriciaMine B  Utilised memory comparison The objective of the study of utilised memory was to investigate whether a manipulation of multi-relational patterns caused a need for a bigger quantity of this resource Fig. 7 shows a graphic comparison in relation to utilised memory in the application of the algorithms on the SIVAT base Note that utilized memory was similar with both algorithms for most of the support values. Nevertheless, for the lower support values, is this case 1%, the Patricia Mine needed a larger quantity of memory. This behaviour is related to the number of nodes generated by the respective algorithms in the different support configurations, as can be seen in Table II According to Table II, for a support value equal to 1 the PatriciaMine generated 18,435 more nodes than MRRadix. This difference is explained by the necessity of having to join tables which causes the generation of a higher number of frequent items and, consequently, a higher number of nodes in the Patricia-trie. On the other hand, for higher support values the PatriciaMine algorithm shows less memory use than MR-Radix. This results from the fact that the traditional algorithm theoretically handles more simple patterns which come from a single table This characteristic should be related to the results relative to the execution time of the algorithms. Even though the MR-Radix uses a slightly higher use of memory with certain support values, due to the manipulation of multi-relational patterns, its execution time remains substantially lower when compared to PatriciaMine  Figure 7  Utilised memory graphic Ö MR-Radix and PatriciaMine TABLE II  N UMBER OF N ODES IN THE SIVAT  B ASE T REE  Algorithms  Support 1 5 10 20 30 MR-Radix 40426 24272 16266 10473 5580 PatriciaMine 58861 21670 14545 9287 5865  Still analysing the utilised memory graphic in Fig. 7, it can be seen that the algorithm PatriciaMine has a more vertical growth curve, indicating that the need of memory space intensifies faster as support values reduce. On the other hand, the MR-Radix algorithm has a more conservative curve, which shows an interesting characteristic, because the increase in demand of frequent items does not result in a significant growth of utilized memory VI  C ONCLUSION  The comparative study confirmed the efficacy and efficiency of the multi-relational MR-Radix algorithm for use in relational databases, in terms of execution time and utilized memory. This algorithm was analysed with comparisons to the traditional PatriciaMine algorithm which showed that multi-relational mining has, in fact, a better efficiency as it avoids costly multiple table joining operations. Moreover, the multi-relational approach does not show semantic losses, not like the traditional algorithms that can induce errors or inaccuracies during the joining of tables Thereby, this work presents, as an original contribution the MR-Radix algorithm which has a performance of confirmed efficacy of the multi-relational approach A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  Project financed by CAPES R EFERENCES  1  R.

      niasup 1ni1}asupminconf{maxasup  a i 1ii i  For example: we can see from Table 2, the support of [1 is 4/6, and the support of [1 **] is the greatest in the all items, so its MIS value is its own support 2/3. From this calculation, we can draw the support of various items and items among layers in Table 3 IV. APPLICATION EXAMPLE We use the form of a hierarchical structure to encode the user purchase information in table 1, express the value in the corresponding with the various items hierarchical encoded of the TID by information granulation, and calculate the support corresponding to each item encoded by the hierarchical structure, which are shown in table 2. Through the definition of multiple minimum supports based on Granular Computing and the minimum support derived form the various items calculated in Table 2,we can calculate minimum supports corresponding to each item and level-items and show  in Table 3 The entire mining process of multi-level association rules is start at the search of is high-level frequent itemsets. Each item has a minimum support by definition 2. Search the transaction data in table 2 to find the frequent itemsets which meet the minimum support in same layer and multiple layers, while record them in table 4. For example, we calculate the multiple minimum support of [1 **] and [2 **] is1 / 3, sup \([1 **] [2  111100 ? 100101 which meet the minimum support 1 / 3. therefore, [1 **] and [2 are combined as frequent itemset. To extract the frequent itemsets repeatedly, and filter the candidate itemsets which does not meet the minimum support. Finally all the frequent 2 


itemsets are shown in table 4. While no further increase in levels, the entire search process will end Then we find frequent 3 - itemsets from all the frequent 2 itemsets in table 4 which meet the multiple minimum support of definition 2, and filter out the candidate itemsets which does not meet. Repeatly extract the frequent 3  itemsets, until the entire search process is completed, the results is shown in table 5 The generation process of frequent itemsets of multi-level mining is as follows TABLE II.

MIS \([MIS \([12 2 12 *] and 2 frequency down-generating search space of frequent itemsets V. CONCLUSIONS This paper presents a multi-level association rule mining method based on binary information granules operations and multiple minimum support constraint, with hierarchical encoding and binary granular computing of information granules operation to acquire frequent itemsets at intra level as well as inter level. We give a new definition of support and confidence based on binary information granules. And combined with the definition of multiple minimum supports we effectively restrained the generation search space of frequent itemsets, and found new rules implied in the scarce data items, achieved association rule mining of multi-layer including cross-layer. We got more meaningful rules, and avoided the generated useless rules from the high frequency data items. At last, the method is applied to mining agricultural information association rules, which has been proven to be effective and practical REFERENCES  1] Agrawal R, Imielinski T, Swami A.

of the proposed approach are described. A simulation dataset with 64 items and 10000 transactions were used in the experiments. The dataset followed the exponential distribution. The initial population size P is set at 50, the archive size is set at 30, the crossover rate pc is set at 0.8, and the mutation rate pm is set at 0.001. The parameter d of the crossover operator is set at 0.35 according to Herrera et al.s paper [14] and the set of minimum support values is {3 4%, , 13%}. The experiments were first made for demonstrating the evolution of the Pareto fronts by the proposed approach. The evolution of the Pareto fronts of chromosomes in the archive along with different generations by the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 1 From Fig. 1, we can observe that the solutions were distributed on the Pareto fronts and the final solutions after 500 generations were better than those in different generations. Besides, we can also found that the derived solutions on a Pareto front are trade-offs between the two objectives. It thus depends on the user preference to decide which solutions on a Pareto front are desired. The experiment was then made for comparing the final Pareto front of chromosomes in the archive of the proposed approach with the previous approach [2], and is shown in Fig. 2  250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 Suitability To tal N um be r o f L 1

Comparison results of final Pareto fronts between the proposed approach and the previous approach  From Fig. 2, it is easily to know that the Pareto front derived by using the proposed approach is better than the previous one.  From the experimental results, we thus can conclude that the proposed approach is not only effective in finding an appropriate set of solutions, but also can provide different options to users for further analysis VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS The SPEA2 adopted a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method to derive better Pareto solutions 25]. In this paper, we have utilized it to propose a more sophisticated multi-objective approach to find the appropriate sets of membership functions for fuzzy data mining. Two objective functions are used to find the Pareto front. They are minimizing the suitability of membership functions and maximizing the total number of large 1-itemsets respectively Experiments on a simulation dataset were also made to 


show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach is effective in finding an appropriate set of solutions. Further, the experiments also show that the proposed approach can derive better Pareto front than the previous one [2]. In the future, we will continuously enhance the multi-objective genetic-fuzzy approach for more complex problems REFERENCES 1] C. C. Chan and W. H.

n-dimension data cube\( I1  I k Support=sup_count/total_count 2 3 4. Performance Analysis Example 2 Lets talk about a practical problem just like the status of sales. Assume that we will mine the association rules involved 4 dimension attributes of sales, the minsup=25%. First of all, using OLAP technology to build a 4-D data cube and the 4 dimension attributes are: time location, item, and supplier. For location dimension which contains area, country and so on, we choose province level We use brand level for item dimension, company level for supplier dimension. Time dimension can be divided as Q1 1-3 4-6 7-9 10-12 location\(P1,P2,L1,L2 York, item\(B1,B2,B3,B4 C1,C2,C3 sales data cube can be generalized like this Graphic 2: The 4-Dimension Data Cube of Sales The details of this sales data cube are in the table follow: The amount of cells is 100 Location Time Item Supplier Count Cell-1 P1 Q1 B1 C2 5 Cell-2 P1 Q3 B1 C1 2 Cell-99 L1 Q3 B1 C1 3 Cell-100 L2 Q4 B1 C3 11 Table 2: The details data table of sales data cube We use original Apriori_Cube Algorithm to find frequent predicate set with minsup_num= 25%*100=25 According the data table we calculate that sup_count of every member of dimension L is \(P1:8, P2:5, L1:1, L2:24 and also T, I, S. So there is the process Graphic 3: The processes of old algorithm As we know, through comparing with the minsup_num dimension location has no one frequent 1-predicate set, so that there have no frequent 4-predicate set in the output by the original algorithm. But users are interested in the Candidate 1-Predicate set L T I S P1 P2 L1

But this time, users require that different members from dimension item can exist at the same time So we redo this mining process by the improved Algorithm Graphic 4: The processes of improved algorithm At last, we got the frequent 4-predicate set which the users are interested in, and then can format the rules 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size 


of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.
