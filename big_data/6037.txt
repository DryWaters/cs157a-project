Sequence Pattern Discovery of Events Caused by Ground Fault Trips in Power Distribution Systems Oscar A. Quiroga, Joaquim Melendez, Sergio Herraiz and Jorge Sanchez Abstract In this paper, sequences of events registered in power distribution systems are analysed using pattern sequence discovery algorithms. The events considered in the study are basically voltage sags generated by homopolar faults and registered by power quality monitors installed in the secondary of transformers in distribution substations. The events registered in a measuring point have associated the time of occurrence and the list of increasing-time ordered events corresponds to a sequence. The aim is to discover existing temporal patterns or episodes, that occur sufficiently often along that sequence Sequence pattern discovery algorithms are used to discover those frequent episodes. Then, frequent episodes are used to obtain association rules that describe relationships between time spans of successive events. The method has been tested with data from gathered in different substations I. INTRODUCTION The failures of components in power distribution systems can have a great impact on the reliability and continuity of electricity supply to the customers [1]. Some faults are caused by conditions external to the network operation accidents, weather conditions, animals, etc produced due to degradation of components such as wires insulators, surge arresters, etc. The last, can be analysed as predictable events of the power system produced by a degraded behaviour of some components [2]. Different methods and strategies to predict the performance of the network in fault conditions and to identify disturbances associated to possible failures at an early stage are being proposed recently [3], [4] and [5]. This work is also in this direction and proposes the use of sequence pattern discovery algorithms to characterise sequences of events frequently occurred in the power system for its further analysis Events are phenomena which only happen once in a while and can be described by parameters as depth and duration voltage sags also to include the time between consecutive events in the description \(all of these parameters in stochastic sense  Voltage events \(interruptions, transient overvoltage and voltage sags 


sags are used n this work. Origin of voltage sags is variate but they can reflect faults occurring in the power distribution system [1] and are characterised by a reduction in the supply voltage magnitude \(depth after a short period of time \(duration O.

Consequently pattern sequences described by those faults can be diverse. In case of auto-extinguishing faults, the number of successive events generated will be lower than when there is a permanent damage according to the number of times that the protection system operates \(opening and reclosing fault. Typically those events are being registered in huge databases containing rich information describing network operation and performance. So, in the paper we explore the possibility to exploit this information for forecasting failures and improving knowledge about electricity networks The aim is to automatically identify sequences of events associated with the same fault. Then, the existence of these sequences permits to compare protective system actuation in several substations of power system. Table I shows typical reclosing settings \(automatic and manual coordination strategies underground lines. Reclosing strategy depends on the line to protect; in this case there are four options for reclosing to the same number of line types as shown in the bottom of the Table I. Then, the goal consists in applying pattern discovery algorithms for finding the frequent time spans between successive events and to associate them with possible fault 


trips. Then, those frequent episodes can be used to verify the consistency of settings of the protection system with respect to those described in Table I. In this work, the frequent episode discovery framework proposed in [6] has been used to discover those temporal patterns where frequent episodes are temporal patterns that occur sufficiently often along to a single long sequence. Once such frequent episodes are known, association rules [7] can be obtained to predict the apparition of future events, with a minimal confidence level At this moment, these prediction rules are useful to obtain a simple representation of how protective system is performing in order to assist process understanding and further work is being conducted to obtain failure forecasting rules A.

Table II exemplifies the representation of successive events recorded in the database for a measurement point Each logged event has three main attributes: t begin is the date of occurrence of the event; devent is the duration of the event; pevent is the depth of the voltage sag generated by the event and corresponds to the percentage that the rms voltage value decreases during the event II. RELATED WORK Development of automatic strategies for dealing with power quality monitoring problems \(disturbance recognition and classification, failure analysis and forecasting, fault location, etc An extensive review and formulation of problems related to power quality, focusing primarily on voltage sags and interruptions is reviewed in [1]. Incipient fault detection and analysis of failures is a recent topic of great interest for the development of predictive maintenance policies of the electrical system. For example, in [2] abnormal and intermittent variations of voltages and/or currents are studied to early recognise the apparition of those incipient faults. The idea of analyzing the evolution of incipient faults is introduced in [2] and [8]. The idea is to isolate parameters that can predict failures of components. Artificial intelligence method to predict and detect faults at an early stage in power systems 1ENDESA DISTRIBUCION is used in [3]. ANNs are employed to monitor the states of some components in power networks, such as switchgear and transformers with the aim of to detect and alert the operator before a catastrophic fault actually occurs. Fault distribution modeling for the stochastic prediction of voltage sags in power networks are developed in [4] and [5] with the goal of predicting the performance of the power network under transient conditions. A fault diagnosis model, based on data 


mining of sequences of events \(SOE high-voltage transmission line systems \(HVTLS in [9]. SOE is a log that records the signals and alarms produced by the protection systems and the proposed model makes use of spatio-temporal characteristics contained in the SOE logs. Fault diagnosis of power systems identifies faulty components based on the real-time alarm information occurred in accidents The approach in this paper is different because it focuses only on voltage events. Sequence pattern discovery algorithms will be used with this purpose. Pattern discovery in sequential data has been widely applied in different fields \(financial series, alarms in communication networks sequences of queries in databases, sequences of customer transactions, etc in power systems. The common goal in those domains is to automatically discover interesting patterns according to different criteria [10]; but depending on the nature of the data, the identification of patterns can follow different approaches. For example, if the dataset consists of a collection of sequences containing different items, the task may be to discover ordered subsequences of items that occur in many of these sequences \(sequential patterns [11 if the dataset consists of a unique and extensive sequence the task may be focused on discovering temporal patterns that occur many times throughout the sequence \(frequent episodes [6 data from assembly lines in manufacturing plants [12] and to analyze neurobiological data [13] under some explicit time constraints with respect to the original approach. Another exiting approach is based on the assumption that in an event sequence there are events at each time slot in terms of various intervals \(hours, days, weeks, etc must satisfy more complex representation [14 The most suitable approach for this work is to consider episodes in event sequences. Two algorithms called WINEPI and MINEPI were developed for frequent episodes discovery 6 proposed to extend previous algorithms for episode mining from complex sequences \([14 the problem of recognizing episodes in sequences of voltage events under certain adaptation we will explain later 


A. Search Episodes According to the terminology developed in [6], given a set E of event types, an event is a pair \(A, t a type of event, A ? E, and t is its time of occurrence The event type can contain different attributes. A sequence of events s can be expressed as \(s, Ts, Te 137 A1, t1 A2, t2 An, tn ti ? ti+ 1 for all i = 1, ..., n? 1, Ts is the beginning time of the sequence and Te is the ending time of the sequence being Ts ? ti < Te for all i = 1, ..., n The objective is to find within the sequences all the frequent episodes of a particular class. The events in an episode must occur close enough, being the user who decides how close must be the events to be part of an episode. This decision is made by defining a time window. A time window is an event sequence w = \(w, ts, te te > Ts, and w consists of pairs \(A, t ts ? t < te. The time span te?ts is the width of the window called win. A window can be seen as a slice of an event sequence and, then, an event sequence can be viewed as a sequence of partially overlapped windows. According to the previous definition, the first and last windows on a sequence extend outside the sequence, so that the first window contains only the first time point of the sequence, and the last one contains only the last point. With this definition an event close to either the beginning or the end of a sequence is observed in the same number of windows as an event in the middle of the sequence An episode is a collection of partially ordered events occurring together. The frequency \(fr number or fraction of windows where the episode occurs The user must specify the minimum frequency \(min fr consider an episode as frequent. Frequent episodes may be of several classes: serial episodes, when events occur strictly in that order in the sequence; parallel episodes, where the relative order of events in the sequence is not restricted, and non-serial and non-parallel episodes, which can be seen as a combination of serial and parallel episodes. Fig. 1 shows an example of an event sequence and the different classes of episodes represented as directed acyclic graphs. The episodes are built iteratively, starting from events and subepisodes 


which also must be frequent. It is defined that an episode is a subepisode of ? if the events of ? also belong to ? in the same partial order of ? and the events of ? are connected to all events of ? that are not in ?. An example of this type can be seen in Fig. 1 B. Association Rules According to [7], the problem of finding association rules falls within the purview of databases mining, also called knowledge discovery in databases [15]. Association rules describe the connections between events in a given sequence and are obtained from frequent episodes [6]. For instance if the episode ? showed in Fig. 1 is a subepisode of ?, and occurs in 5% of windows, i.e. fr in 4% of windows, i.e. fr that after appearing events A and B in a window, there is a possibility of 0.8 to obtain the event C in the same window The fraction fr  and can be interpreted as the conditional probability that the entire episode ? occurred in a window if a subepisode ? has occurred in it Fig. 1. Event sequence and classes of episode III. PATTERN DISCOVERY IN SEQUENCES OF EVENTS As mentioned above, concepts of the algorithm WINEPI are used to discover frequent episodes in the time span between successive events monitored at the same point of measurement in the power network. Our initial interest is related with serial episodes found in the sequence of events A. The Considered Features of Events The sequence of events consists of registers of voltage sags, monitored at the same point of the distribution network during a period of time. These registers should be sorted by their dates of occurrence. Elapsed times between successive events are calculated in order to create a new sequence consisting of the time spans between successive events. Next the values of the sequence of time spans are discretized to form the sequence of nominal values. Then, the frequent episode algorithm will be used to find the frequent time spans. Other attributes of events are not considered in this work. Table III shows the intervals used to discretize the time spans based on those listed in the Table I \(intervals highlighted 


The time window definition has been slightly modified to consider a fixed certain number of successive events instead a fix time. Only serial episodes with occurrence frequency fr min fr by the user are searched. Next, those frequent serial episodes found, are reinterpreted as association rules that describe the relationship between events. Only association rules with a confidence \(conf min conf IV. TEST OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTION As it has been commented before, the database has records of events registered at different points of the network \(transformer substations the proposed methodology are presented in detail for one of these monitored points in the system and then the most relevant results from the analysis of all data points are summarized Table IV shows some of the consecutive events measured at one point of the distribution network. The events are duly organized and classified according to the proposed 138 TABLE III INTERVALS OF CLASSIFICATION TIME SPAN BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE EVENTS time span type intervals 1] t?1 s 2] 1 s ? t ? 10s 3] 10 s ? t ? 20s 4] 20 s?t?50 s 5] 50 s?t?100 s 6] 100 s?t?5 min 7] 5 min?t?10 min 8] 10min?t? 30min 9] 30 min?t? 2 h 10] 2 h?t? 5 h 11] 5 h?t? 1 day 12] 1 day?t? 2 days 13] 2 days ?t? 5 days 14] 5 days ?t? 15 days 15] t?15 days solution. The first column \(index registers in the sequence according to the events occurrence 


date, t begin, which is showed in the second column. The third column displays the duration of the event and the fourth column, interval, show the lapse times between successive events. Lapse times are calculated by subtracting the beginning time of the event \(column 2 date of the previous event \(column 2 + column 3 column of the table contains the time span type assigned to the interval according to Table III. The complete sequence of events \(lapse times only appears information related to the index and the event type. There are 50 events and 11 event types. Considering a window with a width, win, equal to 5 events, a minimum frequency, min fr, equal to 0.15 and a minimum confidence min conf , equal to 0.5, there are three frequent episodes of length 2, which are shown in Table V Table V also shows the frequency \(support subepisodes and episodes. This information is needed to construct association rules. Episode ?1 relates events due to the same fault. This episode appears in the sequence of events due to faults that causes multiple events \(minimum 3 events due to same fault reclosing protection system occurs frequently. ?2 indicates that often the difference in time between consecutive events or faults is several days. ?3 related events occurred with a time difference of a few hours, these events indicate manual operations of the protection system for the normalization of a failure \(events due to same fault self-extinguishing. Fig. 2 shows the frequent serial episodes found in the event sequence \(Table V Table VI shows the rules found with confidence greater than 0.5 from frequent episodes shown in Table V. In general the rules show the relationships among events more clearly than the frequent episodes on their own. The first rule shown in Table VI indicates that if two events have a time span less than 1 s, one may expect with a confidence of 0.75 that there will be a third event within 50 s to 100 s following the second one. Similarly, the second rule indicates that if two TABLE IV CHARACTERIZATION OF EVENTS FOR A MEASUREMENT POINT index t begin devent timespan\(s ms

Rules represent connections between events and allow the prognosis for the future development of similar events Results show that, for the analyzed sequence of events, frequent episodes contain about 50% of all the events recorded at that point in the network. Likewise, association rules 


relate approximately the 34% of the events, which enables the forecast of new events that are the same type as those contained in the rules. In a similar way to the presented case we analyzed 62 different measurement points with a total of 6300 events occurred in the distribution network over 2 years TABLE VI ASSOCIATION RULES AND THEIR CONFIDENCE rule conf  1]?

The parameters used to extract the association rules are win = 5, min fr = 0.15 and min conf = 0.5. The summary showed in Table VII indicates that the ranges of occurrence of events in each measurement point presents different behaviours and, therefore, it is necessary to examine separately the sequences of each measurement point for a successful development of a valid prediction. The results show that it is possible to build rules to relate time spans between successive events which give an estimate of time lag for the appearance of a new event. Although it is not possible to relate all the events of the sequence, the knowledge of network behavior is improved, and takes advantage of power system information available in databases. Finally, different values of win min fr and min conf were tested to find frequent episodes 


and association rules. The result show that increasing win larger episodes can be found, while increasing min fr and min conf the amount of frequent episodes and rules will be minor, since the requirement for selection increases Similarly, it was found that using WINEPI methodology, the frequency of an episode is proportional to the width of the window. The appropriate values of min conf and min fr are defined taking into account criteria such as sequence length, type events frequency and the confidence threshold that the user wishes to assume. It is advisable to test different values of min conf and min fr V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS The proposed methodology suggests a new approach for failure analysis in power distribution system. The aim of the solution is the forecast of faults, which is analyzed in the domain of temporal data mining and, in particular, the discovery of patterns starting from the registers of events The proposed solution is able to extract useful information about the behaviour and evolution of the faults in the electrical system, as a first step in the exploitation of event sequences recorded in power distribution systems, for the prediction of future failures Future work should continue with the search of episodes in sequences of events to discovery patterns related with failures in components and to exploit other information contained in the events recorded besides the elapse times between events e.g., the depth of voltage sags during the fault, etc. Next use this information from a predicting point of view, to anticipate future failures VI.
