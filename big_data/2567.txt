Developing a Scientific Im age Retrieval System wi th Prediction Capability  Li-Jen Kao Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering Hwa Hsia Institute of Technology Taipei, 23568 Taiwan lijenkao@cc.hwh.edu.tw Chung-Fu Lu Department of Computer and Communication Engineering Taipei College of Maritime Technology Taipei, 11174 Taiwan peter@mail.tcmt.edu.tw  Abstract Observing scientific images allows scientists to have better understanding on Earth. For example, remote 
se nsing image s ar e applie d to h e lp monitor i ng oc e a n and c limate  change. These images will be st ored in database and may be retrieved later for reference purpose. The possible retrieval methods may be to give keywords or a query image to the system to get desired images. However, scientists sometimes might want the scientific image system be smart, that is, they want the system to present some images th at can predict future variations Currently, the retrieval methods can not achieve the previous requirement. This paper proposes an intelligence scientific image retrieval system based on cont ent-based image retrieval. While retrieving, this system can ex ploit the spatial relationship between the objects in query image, and then retrieve images that their spatial semantic are similar to the query image Moreover, the spatial association rules are also mined and are 
then used as a basis for retrieving additional images for prediction purpose. The experiments demonstrate that the images retrieved by the proposed system are more accurate, and the system can also predict the future variations Keywords—content-based image re trieval, spatial association rules mining I   I NTRODUCTION  Scientific images such as remote sensing images are collected at an ever-increasing pace and are made available to the public. One can build a database system to store scientific images and retrieve them later for research reference Traditional keyword-based queries and content-based image retrieval technology are two common methods to retrieve images. In traditional image retrieval, users want the retrieved 
images are very close to the queries; however, this is not enough for scientific image retrieval. While retrieving scientific images, users may even want the system to provide prediction information. Currently, the mentioned retrieval methods can only get images that are similar to the queries but could not provide prediction information. In order to get effective scientific image retrieval results, the retrieval technology must be improved. The method of keyword-based queries is not suitable since it cannot be used for more elaborate queries. In this paper, content-based image retrieval technology is thought an adequate way to retrieve scientific images There are several studies that are proposed for contentbased image retrieval strategies [9 ese strateg i es u s uall y  
use low-level features such as color, texture and shape to calculate the similarity between images. In order to retrieve extra images that can provide prediction information, this paper develops a scientific image retrieval system that contentbased image retrieval and inter-transaction association rules mining methods are employed to achieve the above goals Before retrieving images, our proposed system will use a spatial reference model to help to build a spatial transaction database. Next, the inter-transaction association rules algorithm is applied to get spatial variation patterns While querying images, the system retrieves images based on low level features and objects’ spatial relationships extracted from query image. Next, the system will get additional images according to the mined variation patterns for 
future variation trends prediction. The experiments reveal the retrieved images are more li ke the query image since the spatial semantics are considered during retrieval The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows Section 2 describes the problems of traditional content-based image retrieval. Section 3 introduces our proposed algorithm and experimental evidence is prov ided in section 4. At last section 5 concludes this paper II  R ELATED W ORKS  A  Content-based Image Retrieval Advances in multimedia technologies have led to huge 
archives of images in diverse applications such as medicine remote sensing, and entertainment applications. To exploit the full benefit of the explosive growth of image data, there is an urgent demand to develop efficient techniques for storage browsing, indexing and retrieval In recent years, automatic indexing and retrieval based on image content has become more desirable for developing large volume image retrieval  m p l es of content-based image retrieval are QBIC \(Query by Image Content VisualSEEK by Columbia University In content-based image retrieval, color, shape and texture are the main features both humans and computers used to recognize images. Most cont ent-based image retrieval techniques will compute and stor e each image’s feature vector 
in the image database. While retrieving, a query image is given and the feature vector of the qu ery image is computed and then is taken to be compared with the feature vector of each image stored in the image database. An image is retrieved if its feature vectors are similar to the feature vectors of query image Weighting Euclidean distance is used to measure how a certain image closes to the query image 000 000\020\000 i iii tqTQ 000Z  1

where Q is query image and q i is low level feature of Q  T is a certain image in database and t i is low level feature of T  w i is the weight factor B  Scientific Image Advances in technology have enabled scientist to collect scientific data and scientific image from observations and simulations at an ever-increasi ng pace. Data analysis tools or image processing systems become very important to scientist In order to describe our proposed scientific image retrieval system, Argo images are downloaded and used as our experimental data in this paper. Argo is a global array of 3,000 free-drifting profiling floats that measures the salinity and temperature of the upper 2,00 0 m of the ocean h e monthly ocean salinity and te mperature images are made freely available to members of the International Argo Project and the national contributing programs http://www.argo.ucsd.edu, http://argo.jcommops.org\. 1 shows a monthly salinity image, and a monthly temperature image downloaded from Argo For the scientist to benefit from these scientific images collecting capabilities, it is becoming clear that semiautomated techniques, such as the ones in data mining, must be applied to find the useful information in the data. Data mining helps extract the spatial semantics in images and define a spatial transaction database which allows spatial association rules to be discovered and hence enhance the retrieval effectiveness C  Spatial Transactions Inter-transaction association rules mining [4 i s  employed for discovering spatial variation patterns. However association rule mining algorithms assume that a finite set of disjoint transactions are given as input to the algorithms [3  and there is no explicit finite set of transactions in an ocean image. This study adopts the strategy proposed in  w h ere the spatial transaction is defined around the instances of a special reference feature. Taipei is chosen as the reference site and concentric circles are used to define neighboring regions to the reference site. Fig. 2 shows this reference centric model The salinity or temperature varia tions are extracted first from each image. The variations with in the concentric circles are treated as a single transaction The concentric circles are also used to annotate the location of the salinity or temperature variations. The sub-zones defined by the concentric circles repr esent different distances and directions to the reference site. For example, sub-zone A2 is in the east-northeast sector far from Taiwan. In fact, the concentric circles model helps not just defining a single transaction but a spatial transaction III  S CIENTIFIC I MAGE R ETRIEVAL AND M INING S TRATEGY  A database is built to store Argo ocean salinity and temperature images. In this pa per, salinity or temperature variation is called an object and will be cut from image according to its color. In order to annotate the location of each object, a reference model, a set of concentric circles, is applied to each image before objects are cut. Thus, each object’s spatial information is maintained, and a spatial transaction is obtained. The spatial transaction attributes are quantitative and need to be mapped to several intervals. Following are the steps to get salinity and temperature variation patterns A  Quantitative Attribute Transformation First, each quantitative attribut e needs to be transformed into binary attributes B  Frequent Inter-transaction Itemsets Discovery Next, the inter-transaction items and frequent intertransaction itemsets can be found by applying apriori-like algorithm. One can find the detail s of the apriori-like method in [5  C  Variation Patterns Generation After frequent inter-transaction itemsets being discovered the salinity and temperature varia tion patterns can be generated D  Scientific Image Retrieval Previous sections describe how to build the image database and its corresponding spatial transaction database. This section describes the process of how to retrieve the scientific image The objects \(salinity and temper ature variations\o be extracted from query image accord ing to their color before retrieval works starting A set of concentric circles is applied to the query image the same time to help annotate location to objects cut from query image. Now, the object spatial location is its coordinate sin,cos 000T 000T ii rryx 000  may be the inner circle radius or the outer circle radius  i r 1 r 2 r 000T is the angle to x axis From above descriptions, an object can be represented by 000\013 000\014 yxc  where c is the color of the object x and y are the coordinate of the object Assume an object q in the query image is represented by its feature vector 000\013 000\014 qqq yxcq  000 and 000\013 000\014 ttt yxct  000 is an object in an image. Euclidean distance is used to measure the distance between these two objects   tq color cctq 000\020\000 3   tqtq location yyxxtq 000\020\000\016\000\020\000 4 where color tq  is color distance and location tq  is the location distance between two ob jects. Two objects are similar if their color and location ar e close enough. That is, two objects are similar if the colo r distance is less than a predefined threshold and location distance is less than threshold  color T location T The target image in a database is similar to the query image if the total number of similar objects is greater than the threshold For example, there ar e six objects in the query image and the threshold is set to 60%, and the target image is similar to query image if at least four objects in the target image are close to the objects in the query image image T

The above descriptions illustrate how the system retrieves images according to the quer y image’s color feature and objects’ spatial location. The following example explains how to get extra images to predict future variation trends Example. Assume there are total n objects 000  cut from the query image 000 000 n ooo  21 Step 1. Choose one object each time and the variation pattern that its antecedent part is will be selected. For example, assume is the selected object, then all the variation pattern has the form will be selected. The consequent part Y may be any possible objects i o i o i o Yo i 000 Step 2. Repeat step 1 until each object in 000 is checked  n ooo  21 Step 3. Get 2, 3, 4, ..., and n objects and select all variation patterns that their antecedent pa rts that match the selected objects Step 4. Repeat step 3 until all combinations of object pairs are checked  Step 5. Based on the selected variation patterns, list the images according to the conseque nt part of the pattern. For example, if is the selected pattern, the images match the consequent part Y 11 Yo 000 1 will be retrieved IV  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION  This research downloaded ocean salinity and temperature images from 2001/01 to 2007/12. An image database was built comprising these images. An object is defined as either a salinity variation or a temperature variation and one can get all the objects in a certain image acco rding to their color. A set of concentric circles was used as a reference model as it allows objects’ location information can be easily defined. That is, the location information was annotated to its corresponding object The same monthly salinity and temperature variations are defined as a single transaction While getting salinity and temperature variation patterns the maxspan window size is set to 6 months. The minimum support is set to 25%, and the minimum confidence is set to 70%. Table I shows part of the discovered inter-transaction association rules. For exampl e, the rule, H1SRL\(0 A2SRL\(3\, means that if salinity rose from 0.05 psu to 0.15 psu in the area that is in the west-south sector near Taiwan then salinity will rise from 0.05 psu to 0.15 psu in the east sector far away from Taiwan the next 3 months The experiment adopted salinity image of January 2007 as the query image. Fig. 3 shows that there were a total of 8 variations cut from the query image. The threshold of measuring the color distance be tween objects is set to 5 is set to 200, and was set to 60%. Fig. 4 shows partial results of image retrieval. Only images that both color and spatial semantics are simi lar to the query image were retrieved. One can see that th e object “salinity rose little SRL\nd in H1 sub-zone in Fig. 3. According to the salinity variation pattern “H1SRL\(0\>A2SRL\(3\the system can retrieve images to predict future salinity variations Fig. 5 shows that the extra salinity image of 2007/04 was retrieved according to the variation patterns color T location T image T V  C ONCLUSIONS  As we can see that if the spatial semantics are not considered during retrieval, the system will get a lot of images that are similar to the query im age according to colors. In this case, users have to manually browse the retrieved images which is inefficient. And the most important thing is if the system cannot provide information of future variation trend, it is much harder to monitor the ocean environment. Therefore inter-transaction association rules algorithm is employed to discover salinity and temperature variation patterns that are used to obtain additional images for prediction purpose. The experiments show that images similar to the query image in both color and spatial semantics are retrieved. Additional images are also retrieved fo r prediction usage. These two results makes retrieval system more valuable R EFERENCES    Argo Project Introduction.

association mining The Likelihood Ratio Test fails to extract features also belonging to common vocabulary and it makes the extraction dependent on the feature position in the sentence leading to low recall The dBNP and bBNP based methods yield low recall due to the fact that the product features do not occur with the article the in front of them very often The Association Mining approach returns all frequent nouns which decreases precision Our results suggest that the choice of algorithm to use depends on the targeted dataset If it consists of mainly on-topic content the results of Table 10 indicate that the Association Mining algorithm is better suited for this task due to its high recall If the dataset consists of a mixture of onand off-topic content our results suggest that the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm would perform better due to its ability to distinguish and 002lter out the off-topic features For future work we plan to extend the Likelihood Ratio Test methods especially the dBNP based approach by other determiners such as a or this  which should increase the recall of this method Another possibility which we will investigate regards the BNP patterns The current Likelihood Ratio Test approach is not capable of dealing with discontinuous feature phrases for example in 5 the quality of the pictures is great the feature would be picture quality  This problem could be addressed by introducing wildcards in the BNP patterns We will also investigate whether there are any methods in order to calculate an optimal threshold for the candidate feature extraction in order to increase the recall of the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm We plan to investigate whether a deeper linguistic analysis e.g with a dependency parser can improve the feature

a frequency constraint and according to the structure of the dataset These proposals are all based on a global analytical model i.e an interesting approach that needs however to develop complex and speci\036c models As a result they cannot be easily extended to handle complex conjunctions of constraints to incorporate different symbol distributions or different semantics for pattern occurrences To the best of our knowledge no method has been proposed to estimate the number of patterns satisfying a constraint while avoiding to develop a global analytical model Our approach requires only to know how to compute for a given pattern its probability to satisfy the constraint this can be obtained in many situations and it remains ef\036cient in practice by adopting a pattern space sampling scheme 6 Conclusion Using constraints to specify subjective interestingness issues and to support actionable pattern discovery has become popular Constraint-based mining techniques are now well studied for many pattern domains but one of the bottlenecks for using them within Knowledge Discovery processes is the extraction parameter tuning This is especially true in the context of differential mining where domain knowledge is used to provide different datasets to support the search of truly interesting patterns From a user perspective a simple approach would be to get graphics that depict the extraction landscape i.e the number of extracted patterns for many points in the parameter space We developed an ef\036cient technique based on pattern space sampling that provides an estimate on the number of extracted patterns This has been applied to non trivial substring pattern mining tasks and we demonstrated by means of many experiments that the technique is effective It provides reasonable estimates given execution times that enable to probe a large number of points in the parameter space Notice that domain knowledge is also exploited here when selecting the distribution model Future directions of work include to adapt the approach to other pattern domains and to different constraints Another interesting aspect to investigate is the use of more sophisticated sampling schemes e.g that could b e incorporated in the approach when more complex syntactical constraints are handled e.g a grammar to specify the shape of the patterns Acknowledgments This work is partly funded by EU contract IQ FP6-516169 Inductive Queries for Mining Patterns and Models and by the French contract ANR-MDCO14 Bingo2 Knowledge Discovery For and By Inductive Queries We thank Dr Olivier Gandrillon from the Center for Molecular and Cellular Genetics CNRS UMR 5534 who provided the DNA promoter sequences References  J F  Boulicaut L De Raedt and H  M annila e ditors Constraint-Based Mining and Inductive Databases  volume 3848 of LNCS  Springer 2005  C  B resson C K e ime C F a ure Y  Letrillard M  B arbado S San\036lippo N Benhra O Gandrillon and S GoninGiraud Large-scale analysis by SAGE revealed new mechanisms of v-erba oncogene action BMC Genomics  8\(390 2007  L  C ao and C  Z hang Domain-dri v e n actionable kno wledge discovery in the real world In Proceedings PAKDDÕ06 volume 3918 of LNCS  pages 821–830 Springer 2006  G  D ong and J  L i Ef 036cient mining of emer ging patterns discovering trends and differences In Proceedings ACM SIGKDDÕ99  pages 43–52 1999  F  Geerts B  G oethals and J  V  d en Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans on Database Systems  30\(2 2005  U  K eich and P  A  P e vzner  S ubtle motifs de\036ning the limits of motif 036nding algorithms Bioinformatics  18\(10 2002  S  K ramer  L De Raedt and C  Helma M olecular f eature mining in HIV data In Proceedings KDDÕ01  pages 136 143 2001  L  L hote F  Rioult and A  S oulet A v e rage number of frequent closed patterns in bernouilli and markovian databases In Proceedings IEEE ICDMÕ05  pages 713–716 2005  I  M itasiunaite a nd J.-F  B oulicaut Looking for monotonicity properties of a similarity constraint on sequences In Proceedings of ACM SACÕ06 Data Mining  pages 546–552 2006  I Mitasiunaite and J F  Boulicaut Introducing s oftness i nto inductive queries on string databases In Databases and Information Systems IV  pages 117–132 IOS Press 2007  I Mitasiunaite C Rigotti S Schicklin L  M e yniel J F  Boulicaut and O Gandrillon Extracting signature motifs from promoter sets of differentially expressed genes Technical report LIRIS CNRS UMR 5205 INSA Lyon France 2008 23 pages Submitted  G Ramesh W  M aniatty  a nd M J Zaki F easible itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proceedings ACM PODSÕ03  pages 284–295 2003  F  Zelezn  y Ef\036cient sampling in relational feature spaces In Proceedings ILPÕ05  volume 3625 of LNCS  pages 397 413 Springer 2005
