This paper describes our early efforts\nto integrate the processing power of the FPGA with the ARM\nprocessor inside the Xilinx Zynq SoC. An eight-slave Zynq-based\nHadoop cluster is built and a customized hardware accelerator\nfor a standard FIR filter is implemented to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of hardware acceleration. The Xillybus is used for\ncommunication between the ARM processor and the FPGA\nfabric, achieving a bandwidth of 103MB/s. The Hadoop cluster\nis proved to be linearly scalable with different input sizes and\nnumbers of slaves. Overall, the cluster achieves a 3.3-fold speedup\ncompared to a native pure software implementation on a single\nARM processor and about a 20% improvement compared to an\nARM-based cluster without hardware accelerators.\nI INTRODUCTION\nThe interest in ARM-based servers [1] among industry and\nacademia has been growing rapidly in recent years since power\nhas become the main design concern for data centers and\nother high-performance computing clusters. Though ARM-\nbased servers are preferable for workloads with high levels\nof throughput and I/O without a lot of processing, they are\nconsidered not applicable for compute-intensive workloads due\nto the low computing power of the ARM processors. Increasing\nthe computing capability of ARM processors while keeping the\nenergy consumption down is essential to extending the market\nof ARM-based servers.\nThe Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable Soc [2] is a\nnew heterogeneous computing platform developed by Xilinx.\nIt integrates a dual-core Cortex A9 ARM processor and a Field\nProgrammable Gate Array \(FPGA designed to enable extensive system-level differentiation,\nintegration, and flexibility through hardware software, and\nI/O programmability. Like ARM processors, FPGAs are low-\npower devices compared to x86 CPUs However, FPGAs\ncan outperform CPUs in some applications, such as image\nprocessing, due to the inherent parallelism. Incorporating the\ncomputing capability of the FPGA into the ARM processor\ncan be a potential solution to improve the performance of the\nARM-based servers in workloads with processing tasks that\nwork well in FPGAs.\nHadoop [3] is a framework that allows for the distributed\nprocessing of large data sets across clusters of computers using\nWe acknowledge Xilinx, CMC and NSERC for the funding and material\nprovided for this project\nMapReduce programming models. It is becoming increasingly\nimportant for cloud computing and big data offerings. As\nHadoop is designed to work with commodity hardware, it is\nan ideal framework for ARM-based servers to deal with big\ndata processing workloads.\nA MapReduce library is developed in [4] to support FP-\nGAs and graphics processing units \(GPUs execution and\nload-balancing. FPMR [5] is another MapReduce framework\non FPGA that hides the task control synchronization and\ncommunication away from designers. It implements an on-chip\nprocessor scheduler to maximize the utilization of computation\nresources and better load balancing. In the MapReduce frame-\nwork in 6], each worker node consists of a CPU-based worker,\nwhich runs the major communications with other nodes and\nan FPGA-based worker to accelerate the computation process.\nEthernet is used for communication between the CPU and the\nFPGA in the same worker node. Our design differs from these\nwork by using an ARM-based system designed for low power\nconsumption with tightly-coupled on-chip communication be-\ntween the ARM and the FPGA in a single device.\nThis paper details our efforts to build a Hadoop cluster us-\ning the Zynq chips on commodity and low-cost ZedBoards [7].\nCustomized hardware accelerators are added to increase the\ncomputing capability of the ARM processors. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first ARM-based Hadoop cluster\nincorporating hardware accelerators.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. A brief\nintroduction to Hadoop is given in Section II. Section III gives\nan overview and parameters of the system we have built. A\ndetailed description of the hardware and software design on the\nZedBoard is presented in Section IV. The evaluation results of\nthis initial system are shown in Section V. Section VI presents\nthe conclusion and Section VII gives our future work.\nII. HADOOP BACKGROUND\nThe Apache Hadoop software library [3 is a framework\nthat allows for the distributed processing of large data sets\nacross clusters of commodity hardware. The major components\nof the Hadoop library are the Hadoop Distributed File System\n\(HDFS MapReduce framework [8].\nHDFS is designed for storing very large files with stream-\ning data access patterns by using large block size to minimize\nthe cost of seeks. The blocks of a file are replicated for fault\ntolerance across HDFS. HDFS has a master/slave architecture,\nas shown in Figure 1. An HDFS cluster consists of one\n978-1-4799-2198-0/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE\n?450?\nNameNode\n1 2 2 3\nreplication ...\nDataNode 1 DataNode 2 DataNode n\nFig. 1: HDFS Architecture\nSwitch\ncpu Zed Zed Zed...\nMaster Slave Slave Slave\nFig. 2 


System Overview\nsingle NameNode that manages the file system namespace\nand regulates access to files by clients, and a number of\nDataNodes that manage storage attached to the nodes that they\nrun on. Both NameNode and DataNode are software processes\nto manage the HDFS. The NameNode knows the DataNodes\non which all the blocks for a given file are located and that is\nhow Hadoop minimizes data transmission across the network\nby moving programs to data instead of data to programs.\nMapReduce is proposed by Google [9] as a linearly scal-\nable parallel programming model for the ease of massive data\nprocessing and is the programming model used in the Hadoop\nframework. A MapReduce job usually splits the input data\nset into independent chunks that are processed by the map\ntasks \(mapper input to reduce tasks \(reducers input data set is first split into many <key, value>\npairs, each of which is referred to as a record. The mappers\nwill operate on the generated <key, value> pairs and generate\nnew <key, value> pairs as intermediate results. The reducers\nthen work on the intermediate results and produce new <key,\nvalue> pairs, which will be the output of the MapReduce jobs.\nHadoop Streaming [3] is an Application Programming\nInterface \(API MapReduce that allows clients to write their\nown mapper and reducer function in languages other than\nJAVA Hadoop Streaming takes executables compiled from\nany language as mappers and reducers. When used in text\nprocessing, each row of the input data set is considered as a\n<key, value> pair, where the key is the position of the row\nin the file. Since the C language is still preferable for low-\nlevel I/O operations Hadoop Streaming is used in this work\nto invoke the executables compiled from C programs.\nIII. SYSTEM DESIGN\nFigure 2 shows a high-level overview of the Hadoop cluster\nused in this paper. Instead of a pure ARM-based server, a\nhigh-performance CPU system is employed as the master node.\nThe master node is responsible for running the NameNode of\nHDFS, which maintains the file system tree and the metadata\nfor all the files and directories in the tree, and the job tracker\nthat schedules tasks running on the slaves and ensures load-\nbalance. Since the NameNode is a single point of failure\nand both maintaining the file system tree and tracking tasks\nrequire relatively larger memory than the memory required in\nslave nodes, a more reliable CPU with large main memory is\npreferable to a low-power ARM processor. Although the CPU\nin the master node can be configured to share the computation\nworkloads by virtualizing the hardware, all the workloads are\nrun on the ARM-based slave nodes in this work. The CPU\nsystem used in this work is an Intel\(R TM running at 3.3GHz with 4GB DDR3 memory. The storage\nmedia in the master node is a 1TB hard disk drive and the\nOperating System is 64-bit Ubuntu 13.04.\nEach slave node in the cluster is a ZedBoard from Xil-\ninx [7 The ZedBoard has a Xilinx XC7Z020 Zynq SoC,\nwhich integrates a dual ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore running\nat 667MHz and an Artix-7 FPGA with 85K logic cells and\n560KB Block RAM. The 512MB DDR3 main memory on the\nZedBoard is connected to the Processor Subsystem \(PS to\nthe ZedBoard, the storage media is an 8GB Class 4 SD card,\nwhich has a write speed of about 4MB/s and a cached read\nspeed of 328.36MB/s and a buffered disk read of 19.18MB/s.\nAs the speed of the SD card is an order of magnitude slower\nthan a typical hard drive, the storage system of the ZedBoard\nis likely to be the bottleneck in such a cluster. Each ZedBoard\nsystem runs a Xillinux operating system [10], which is a\nLinux distribution based upon Ubuntu LTS 12.04 for ARM.\nThe X server is disabled in this work to minimize memory\nconsumption of the operating system and a 512MB swap file\nis implemented as the virtual memory in each slave node.\nAs Hadoop is built on commodity network infrastructure, a\n100Mbps Netgear switch is used to connect all the nodes in the\ncluster. A bandwidth of 94Mbps is observed using Iperf [11]\ntest. A maximal throughput of 664-666Mbps to a server is\nsupported for the ZedBoard using a Gigabit switch [7].\nIV. HARDWARE ACCELERATOR\nThe ARM processor and the FPGA on the Zynq SoC\ncommunicate with each other through several AXI buses across\nthe border. Xillybus [10] is an IP core serving as a bridge\nbetween PCIe or AXI bus and an arbitrary number of FIFO\ninterfaces.\nFigure 3 shows how the FPGA interacts with the ARM\nprocessor on a Zynq SoC. The interfaces to the application\nlogic on the FPGA provided by the Xillybus are standard\nFIFOs. For instance, data written to the lower application\nFIFOs in Figure 3 will be sensed by the Xillybus IP core\nand then transmitted to the ARM processor through the AXI\nbus between the ARM processor and the Xillybus IP core.\nIn this work, two 32-bit by 512 FIFOs, one slave port and\none master port, are connected to the customized hardware\n?451?\nXillybus Ltd. www.xillybus.com\nExpress bus as the underlying transport, as well as ARM-based processors, interfac-\ning with the AMBA bus \(AXI3/AXI4 the FPGA only needs to interact with stan-\ndard FIFOs, which are part of the application logic.\nFor example writing data to the lower FIFO in the diagram above makes the Xillybus\nIP core sense that data is available for transmission in the FIFO’s other end. Soon,\nthe Xillybus reads the data from the FIFO and sends it to the host, making it read-\nable by the userspace software. The data transport mechanism is transparent to 


the\napplication logic in the FPGA, which merely interacts with the FIFO.\nOn its other side, the Xillybus IP core implements the data flow utilizing the AXI bus,\ngenerating DMA requests on the processor core’s bus.\nThe IP core is built instantly per customer’s spec, using an online web interface. It’s\nrecommended to build and download your custom IP core at http://xillybus.com/custom-\nip-factory after walking through the demo bundle flow described in this guide.\nThe number of streams, their direction and other attributes are defined by customer\nto achieve an optimal balance between bandwidth performance, synchronization, and\ndesign simplicity.\nThe application on the computer interacts with device files that behave like named\npipes. The Xillybus IP core and driver on the host make the connection, streaming\ndata efficiently and sensibly between the FIFOs in the FPGAs and their respective\ndevice files on the host.\nThis guide explains how to rapidly set up the Xillinux distribution including a demo\nXillybus IP core, which can be attached to user-supplied sources or sinks for real\napplication scenario testing. The IP core is “demo” in the sense it’s not tailored to\nGetting started with Xillinux for Zynq-7000 EPP 4\nFig. 3: Xillybus Overview [10]\naccelerator, running at 100MHz. The ARM to FPGA stream\nis through a generic 32-b t AXI interface while the FPGA to\nARM tream is thro gh a high-perform nce AXI port. The\nXillybus is configured for synchronous I/O, which means data\nis read from the FPGA’s FIFO only when there is a request\nfor data from the host in the form of a read system call.\nExperiments shows that the Xillybus can achieves 103MB/s\nin synchronous I/O tests on the ZedBoard. An obvious boost\nis observed in uni-directional tests with 186MB/s as the writing\nspeed nd 162MB/s for the eading sp ed.\nAs an exampl accelerator for the ZCluster, a Finite Im-\npuls Respo se \(FIR  An FIR filter\nis a widely-used way to filter a signa by conv lving the signal\nin the time domain with the impulse response as follows:\ny[n] = b0x[n] + b1x[n? 1] + ...+ bNx[n?N ] \(1 and represent the value of\nthe desired filter impulse response at time = Tsample ? i. A\nlow-pass FIR filter with N = 51 is implemented on the FPGA.\nThe FIR is pipelined to achieve one output sample per cycle\nat 100MHz The input to the FIR filter is from the slave FIFO\nport from the Xillybus, while the output from the FIR filter\nwill be written to the master FIFO port to the Xillybus.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nFor now, the bitstream file for the hardware accelerator\nmust be loaded before the system boots up. After compiling the\nhardware accelerator with the processor system and Xillybus IP\nCore, the generated bitstream file is used to create the system\nboot file and will be loaded by the first stage boot loader to\ninitialize the FPGA before the Xillinux is booted.\nThe input data set to the FIR is a number of ASCII text\nfiles. Each row of a text file represents a signal series and is\ngenerated randomly. The file size is approximately 0.23M per\n40960 samples. All the files are copied to the HDFS by the\nmaster node. The time for the data transfer from the storage of\nthe master node to the HDFS is not included in the results, as\nin reality the files can be stored in the HDFS directly without\nbeing stored in any local file system.\nA. Hardware Acceleration Result\nThe first set of experiments is designed to measure the\nperformance of the hardware accelerator. Since running a\nTABLE I: Hardware Acceleration for FIR\nData Size ARM ARM + FPGA Speedup\n4,096,000 12s 5s 2.4\n40,960,000 117s 49s 2.4\nTABLE II Hardware Consumption\nOccupied Resource Resource Available Occupied Percentage\nLUTs 3,881 53,200 7%\nFFs 4,651 106,400 4%\nRAM36 0 140 0%\nRAM18 10 280 3%\nDSP 63 220 28%\nHadoop program includes all the data transmission across the\nnetwork and other overhead, the native executables are used\nin this experiment. For comparison, a carefully optimized C\nprogram for the same FIR filter without hardware acceleration\nis implemented for the ARM processor. Note that in this\nexperiment all the output to the stdout is disabled to avoid\nslow I/O to the console or to the SD cards. The files are fed\nto the stdin using the cat command in Linux.\nTable I shows the experimental result of the hardware\naccelerator. For both 4,096,000 and 40,960,000 data sizes.\nThe ARM+FPGA system achieves about a 2.4-fold speedup\ncompared to the ARM processor alone. Note that the FPGA is\nrunning at 100MHz while the ARM processor is at 667MHz.\nFor the performance of the pure FIR filter, the FPGA is ex-\npected to achieve an even greater speedup as all the operations\nare fully pipelined on the FPGA. The result includes the\nprocess of getting input from stdin and converting ASCII text\nto integers, which is done on the ARM processor.\nThe hardware consumption of the current implementation\nis presented in Table II. The system includes two AXI buses,\none full Xillybus, one Xillybus-lite that is designed for simple\nregister mapping access, the FIR filter and a VGA core. Since\nthe FIR filter core mainly consumes DSP blocks rather than\nlogic slices, the logic overhead of such a hardware framework\nfor accelerators is about 7% of the LUTs and 4% of the FFs\nin the FPGA chip. The Xillybus is highly configurable and\nmore hardware consumption is expected if more interfaces to\nthe application logic are configured.\nB. Experiments on the Hadoop Cluster\nIn the second experiment, the scalability of the Hadoop\ncluster is tested by varying the number of slaves. The input\ndata set is 100 files with 40,960 samples per file. For such small\nfiles, the actual computation time is not significant, compared\nto the Hadoop framework that includes creating new mappers\nfor each file on the 


slaves, streaming the file from the HDFS to\nthe stdin of the slave and writing the output of stdout to a file\nin the HDFS. This experiment is mainly designed to examine\nthe work flow of the Hadoop framework.\nFigure 4 shows the execution time for different numbers\nof slaves. The difference between the one-slave cluster and\nthe two-slave one is not significant in terms of the execution\ntime. This is due to the overhead of the Hadoop scheduler in a\nmulti-slave system and the file transfer across the network. For\na one-slave cluster all the files are guaranteed to be ready on\n?452?\nFig. 4: Execution Time vs. Number of Slaves\nTABLE III: Data Size vs. Execution Time\nData Size File Size \(MB s 238 567\nthe local storage, because there will always be a replication\nof each file in each node. For a two-slave cluster, some of\nthe files may have to be transferred from other nodes to the\nlocal storage system Starting from the three-slave cluster, the\nlinearity of the Hadoop cluster is observed, with the six-slave\ncluster and eight-slave cluster running about twice as fast as\nthe three-slave and the four-slave clusters, respectively. This\nis because the files are distributed across all the nodes in the\ncluster and each slave can be scheduled to process files stored\nin the local storage. For a larger number of slaves, a smaller\nproportion of files will be stored in the master node, reducing\nthe chance of data transfer required It is expected that with\nlarger numbers of slaves than eight, the linearity of the Hadoop\ncluster will be better.\nThe third experiment is to test the Hadoop cluster with\ndifferent input sizes. Three file sizes are used in this experi-\nment, as shown in Table III. In the FIR filter application, the\noutput size is the same as the input size. However, HDFS is\nknown to be slow for writing and for most Hadoop applications\nthe generated files will be much smaller than the input files.\nTherefore, the output sample to HDFS is disabled in this\nexperiment. All the measurement results in Table III are an\naverage of three runs and 16 files are used as the input data set.\nSurprisingly the Hadoop cluster runs faster on the 23MB data\nset than the 2.3MB one This is because the HDFS achieves a\nbetter load-balance with the 23MB file size as it is closer to\nthe block size of the HDFS. Since it takes only five seconds\nto process 4,096,000 samples on each slave, the overhead of\nrequesting data from a remote node or serializing another\nmapper to a busy node will be significant. For the 238MB\nfile size, the execution time is almost linearly scaled to the\n23MB file size, indicating the influence of running the Hadoop\nframework is becoming smaller.\nTABLE IV: Comparison of Cluster Performance\nSamples per File ARM ARM+FPGA Speedup\n4,096,000 78s 63s 1.24\n40,960,000 676s 567s 1.19\nTable IV presents a comparison between the Hadoop clus-\nter with and without the hardware accelerators. The hardware\naccelerated cluster achieves almost a 20% improvement com-\npared to the pure software cluster. The speedup is smaller than\nthat in Table I, since the overhead of the Hadoop framework\nis the same for both clusters and is included in this result.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThis paper presents the first implementation of an ARM-\nbased Hadoop cluster using the ZedBoards. A hardware accel-\nerator for an FIR filter is implemented on the FPGA, which\nachieves a 2.4-fold speedup compared to the pure software\nimplementation on the ARM processor The Hadoop cluster\nis demonstrated to scale linearly with different numbers of\nslaves. The eight-node cluster achieves a 3.3-fold speedup\ncompared to a native software implementation on a single\nARM processor and an improvement of about 20% compared\nto an ARM-based cluster without hardware accelerators.\nVII. FUTURE WORK\nCurrently the bitstream file for the FPGA is integrated into\nthe boot file. Later multiple bitstream files can be stored on the\nSD card and loaded dynamically to program the FPGA through\nPCAP for different hardware accelerators. Since the interfaces\nof the accelerator are fixed, High-Level Synthesis tools can be\nused to generate the bitstream files from the standard C code.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Bernstein Research.

Before we continue with the\nevaluation of UNI-ALIGN, we present in Table III the runtime\nand accuracy of all the variants of BIG-ALIGN for aligning\nmovie-genre graphs with varying sizes and permutations with\nnoise level 10%. The parameters used in this experiment\nare  = 10?5, and ? = 0.1. For BIG-ALIGN-Basic, ? is\nconstant and equal to 10?4, while the correspondence matrices\nare initialized uniformly. This is not the best setting for all\nthe pairs of graphs that we are aligning, and it results in\nvery low accuracy. On the other hand, BIG-ALIGN-Skip is\nnot only 350× faster than BIG-ALIGN-Points, but also\nmore accurate. Moreover, it is ? 2× faster than BIG-ALIGN-\nExact with higher or equal accuracy. The speedup can be\nfurther increased by skipping more updates of the gradient\ndescent steps. Overall, the results show that a naive solution\nof the optimization problem, such as BIG-ALIGN-Basic, is not\nsuf?cient, and the optimizations we propose in Section III are\ncrucial and render our algorithm ef?cient.\nC. Evaluation of UNI-ALIGN\nTo evaluate our proposed method, UNI-ALIGN, for aligning\nunipartite graphs, we use the Facebook who-links-to-whom\ngraph [25], which consists of approximately 64K nodes. In this\ncase, the baseline approaches are readily employed, while our\nmethod requires the conversion of the given unipartite graph\nto bipartite. We do so by extracting some unweighted egonet4\nfeatures for each node \(degree of node, degree of egonet5,\nedges of egonet, mean degree of the node’s neighbors As\nbefore, from the initial graph we extract subgraphs of size\n4As a reminder, egonet of a node is the induced subgraph of its neighbors.\n5The degree of an egonet is de?ned as the number of incoming and outgoing\nedges of the subgraph, when viewed as a super-node.\n\(a Higher and left is better runtime\n\(in seconds / logscale small markers medium markers big markers b Lower is better in seconds scale.\nFig. 6: Accuracy and runtime of alignment of unipartite graphs. \(a red points accurate and faster than all the\nbaselines for all graph sizes. \(c red squares the baseline approaches, followed closely by Umeyama’s\napproach \(green circles or equivalently, 264-6K edges per noise level accuracy vs. runtime plot in Fig. 6\(a

Among the suggested approaches\nare genetic, spectral, clustering algorithms [20 decision trees,\nexpecation-maximization [16], graph edit distance [21], sim-\nplex [2], non-linear optimization 12], iterative HITS-inspired\n[5][28]. Notice that all these works are designed for unipartite\ngraphs, while we focus on bipartite graphs.\nOne of the well-known approaches is Umeyama’s near-\noptimum solution for nearly-isomorphic graphs [24]. The\nmethod solves the optimization problem minP||PAPT ?B||\n\(where P is permutation matrix weighted\ngraphs with the same number of nodes. The Hungarian al-\ngorithm [19] is employed at the end to ?nd the node corre-\nspondences. The constraint that P is doubly stochastic matrix\nis imposed in [26] and [29 where the proposed formulation,\nPATH, is based on convex and concave relaxations. Ding et al\n[10] recently proposed a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization\n\(NMF applies an iterative algorithm to ?nd the orthogonal matrix\nP with the node correspondences.\nBradde et al. [7 propose distributed, heuristic, message-\npassing algorithms, based on Belief Propagation [27], for\nprotein alignment and prediction of interacting proteins. In-\ndependently, Bayati et al [3] formulate graph matching as an\ninteger quadratic problem, and also propose message pass-\ning algorithms for aligning sparse networks. A sparse and\nweighted bipartite graph, whose edges represent the possible\nnode matchings between the two graphs is required by these\nalgorihms. The use of the full bipartite graph was proposed\nearlier by Singh et al 22].\nIn all these works, the graphs that are studied are unipartite,\nwhile we focus on bipartite graphs, and also propose an\nextension of our method to handle unipartite graphs.\nVII. DISCUSSION\nThe experiments show that BIG-ALIGN solves ef?ciently a\nproblem that has been neglected in the literature: the alignment\nof bipartite graphs.\nGiven that all the efforts have been targeted at aligning uni-\npartite graphs, why matching bipartite graphs deserves being\nstudied separately? Firstly, bipartite networks are omnipresent:\npeople like webpages belong to online communities, access\nshared ?les in companies, post in blogs, co-author papers,\nattend conferences etc. All these settings can be modeled\nas bipartite graphs. Secondly, although it is possible to turn\nthem to unipartite and apply an off-the-shelf algorithm, as\nshown in the experiments, knowledge of the speci?c structural\ncharacteristics can prove useful in achieving better quality\nalignments. Lastly, this problem enables emerging applica-\ntions. For instance, one may be able to link the clustering\nresults from different networks by applying soft clustering on\nthe input graphs, and subsequently our method on the obtained\nnode-cluster membership graphs.\nAlthough the main focus of our paper is bipartite graph\nalignment the latter inspires an alternative way of matching\nunipartite graphs, by turning them to bipartite. Therefore we\nshow how our framework can handle any type of input graphs,\nwithout any restrictions on its structure.\nFinally, is our approach simply gradient descent? The\nanswer is negative; gradient descend is the core of our algo-\nrithm, but the projection technique, appropriate initialization\nand choice of the gradient step, as well as careful handling\nof known graph properties are the critical design choices that\nmake our algorithm successful \(as shown in Sec. V, where we\ncompare our method to simple gradient descend BIG-ALIGN-\nBasic class of real graphs, bipartite graphs. Our\ncontributions can be summarized as follows:\n1 introduce a powerful primitive with\nnew constraints for the graph matching problem.\n2 an effective and ef?cient algo-\nrithm, BIG-ALIGN, based on gradient descent \(APGD optimization problem with careful\nhandling of many subtleties. We also give a generalization\nof our approach to align unipartite graphs \(UNI-ALIGN 


UNI-ALIGN are superior to state-of-the-art\ngraph matching algorithms in terms of both accuracy and\nef?ciency for bipartite as well as unipartite graphs.\nFuture work includes extending our problem formulation\nto subgraph matching by revisiting the initialization of the\ncorrespondence matrices.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis material is partially supported by the National Science Foundation\nunder Grant No. IIS1017415 and IIS-1217559, the Army Research Laboratory\nunder Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-09-2-0053, and Defense Ad-\nvanced Research Projects Agency \(DARPA information in this\ndocument does not necessarily re?ect the position or the policy of the Govern-\nment, and no of?cial endorsement should be inferred.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
