HNNP – A Hybrid Neural Network Plait for\nImproving Image Classi?cation with Additional Side Information\nRuth Janning, Carlotta Schatten and Lars Schmidt-Thieme\nInformation Systems and Machine Learning Lab ISMLL schmidt-thieme}@ismll.uni-hildesheim.de\nAbstract—Most of the arti?cial intelligence and machine\nlearning researches deal with big data today. However, there\nare still a lot of real world problems for which only small and\nnoisy data sets exist. Hence, in this paper we focus on those\nsmall data sets of noisy images Applying learning models to\nsuch data may not lead to the best possible results because of\nfew and noisy training examples. We propose a hybrid neural\nnetwork plait for improving the classi?cation performance of\nstate-of-the-art learning models applied to the images of such\ndata sets. The improvement is reached by \(1 using additionally\nto the images different further side information delivering\ndifferent feature sets and requiring different learning models,\n\(2 common structure. The proposed hybrid neural network\nplait architecture reached in the experiments with 2 different\ndata sets on average a classi?cation performance improvement\nof 40% and 52% compared to a single convolutional neural\nnetwork and 13% and 17% compared to a stacking ensemble\nmethod.\nKeywords-image classi?cation; convolutional neural network;\nmultilayer perceptron; hybrid neural network; side informa-\ntion small data; noisy data;\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMany problems treated in arti?cial intelligence and espe-\ncially in machine learning nowadays concern big data like\nfor instance data collected from social networks or consumer\ndata. However, there are still also many real world problems\ndelivering less data than desired for learning approaches\nand sometimes this data are additionally very noisy. In this\npaper we focus on those small noisy data sets, or on small\ndata sets of noisy images respectively. Those data sets come\nfor instance from problems in biomedicine, like cutaneous\nmelanoma identi?cation \([13 resonance imaging \([9 14 of\nradar like detecting re?ections of buried objects in ground\npenetrating radar images \(see [6], [7], [8 recognizing\nvolcanoes or craters on synthetic aperture radar images of\nthe surface of planets like Mars or Venus \([15], [16], [19],\n[3 time consuming recording of the\nimages as well as the need of manual labeling. Most of\nthose data are not publicly available. Furthermore, in many\ncases it is unavoidable that the recording method or the\nambiance induce noise into the data. It suggests itself to use\nsupervised learning methods for the classi?cation task of\nthe images in such data sets. However, applying supervised\nlearning methods to small data sets usually delivers not the\nbest possible classi?cation performance. The reason is less\nbroadness in training because of too few training examples in\nthose data sets. Noise within the data is a further disturbing\nfactor. Hence, the question arises, how to improve the clas-\nsi?cation performance of a learning model applied to such\ndata. Very powerful state-of-the-art supervised learning tools\nfor classifying images are convolutional neural networks see\ne.g. [10], [18 of a convolutional\nneural network as well as of ensemble methods applied to\nsmall data sets of noisy images The performance improve-\nment is reached by incorporating additional side information\nin two different ways 1 feature sets for the training and requiring different\nlearning models, \(2 models\ninteractively within one common structure with additional\nimproved side information. This approach results in a plait\nof hybrid neural networks \(?g. 1 real data sets from the\n?eld of radar. In the experiments with this 2 data sets the\nproposed hybrid neural network plait \(HNNP convolutional neural network and by 13%\nand 17% compared to a stacking ensemble method \(see sec.\nIV RELATED WORK\nThe most famous problems convolutional neural networks\nare used for are handwritten digit classi?cation and face\nrecognition.

A more recent\nconvolutional neural network for digit recognition with a\nsimpler and shallower architecture is proposed in [18 The\ncombination of neural networks to ensembles is investigated\ne.g. in [17] and an investigation of stacking or stacked\ngeneralization, can be found e.g. in [20]. A combination of\nmore than one convolutional neural 


network is proposed in\n[4], where a committee of 7 convolutional neural networks is\nused and the outputs are averaged. Different kinds of feature\nsets are used in [5], where 6 feature sets are trained by\nmultilayer perceptrons. The outputs are merged by using\nanother multilayer perceptron. The concept of using side\ninformation is also applied for clustering approaches \([23 22 In [23] a dis-\ntance metric using similarity information is learned and used\nfor clustering with side information. The approach in [22]\nlearns a Mahalanobis distance metric from side information\nfor data clustering and classi?cation. Our work combines\nthe above mentioned approaches by using a committee of\na convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptrons,\ndifferent feature sets and additional side information. How-\never, for our approach different kinds of neural networks\nwith adapted architecture are retrained interactively within\na plait structure using additional side information gained\nbefore and during the retraining for a further improvement.\nIII. THE HYBRID NEURAL NETWORK PLAIT\nAs mentioned above, the proposed hybrid neural net-\nwork plait \(HNNP side information: \(1 2 retraining the neural networks applied to this feature\nsets interactively. Point \(1 neural\nnetworks are used for the different information sources. The\ndifferent information sources are on the one hand the original\ninformation source – the pixel values of the image – and on\nthe other hand sources of additional side information.

A convolution layer adapts\nthe concept of local receptive ?elds by mapping overlapping\nareas of the original image to smaller neighboring areas\nof the feature maps in the following layer. The weights\nfor the convolutions are shared, i.e. they are the same in\nevery single feature map. A subsampling layer reduces the\ndimensionality by mapping several neurons of a feature\nmap to one neuron of a smaller feature map in the next\nlayer. These kinds of layers serve as a kind of local feature\nextractor. The fully connected layers after the convolution\nand subsampling layers on the other hand serve as a trainable\nclassi?er. By considering the concepts of local receptive\n?elds, shared weights and spatial subsampling, cnns ensure\nto some degree shift, scale, and distortion invariance. In [18]\na simpli?ed cnn, which omits the subsampling layers and\nuses only convolution layers, was proposed and evaluated.\nThe cnns used for our approach are based on this architec-\nture \(?g. 2 convolution layers, but for\n25\n... ...\n...\n...\n...\n... ...\nL0\nL1\nL2\nL3\n...o0\ncnn o1\ncnn oN\ncnn\nFigure 2 Architecture of a simpli?ed convolutional neural network.\nIt is composed of four layers L0, L1, L2, L3, where L0 is the input\nlayer fed with the image, L1 is a convolution layer followed by a fully\nconnected layer \(L2 and the output layer L3.

With other words, each network learns\nto which degree it may trust the former classi?cation of\neach of the other networks. The number p + 1 of plait\nlayers is a hyper parameter. It can easily be estimated\nheuristically as it corresponds to the number of sequential\nlayers which decrease the classi?cation error during the\ntraining phase. If the classi?cation error no longer decreases,\nthe plait construction is stopped. In our experiments in sec.\nIV for instance p had the value 2, i.e. the HNNP had 3\nlayers. As the training and testing within one plait layer\ncan be parallelized, the time complexities ttrain\(HNNP ttest\(HNNP complexities of\nthe one neural network nnmax within the plait which has the\nhighest time complexity for training and testing.

How to consider the single classi?ca-\ntion decisions of the single neural networks, to come to one\ncommon classi?cation decision, is learned by nn0 similarly\nto the stacking approach. The difference to simple stacking\nis that HNNP retrains the involved neural networks within\nseveral layers with additional improved side information.\nIV. EXPERIMENTS\nTo evaluate our HNNP approach, we applied it to 2\ndifferent real data sets. The ?rst data set \(sec.

The data were\ncollected by the Magellan spacecraft from 1990–1994 to\nobtain a mapping of the surface of Venus by means of SAR\ntechnology \([15], [16 The classi?cation task in this data\nis the identi?cation of volcanoes. For both data sets we used\nthe same experimental settings: our HNNP approach is com-\npared to the ?ve baselines cnn, nn1, nn2, majority ensemble\nand stacking ensemble. cnn is a single convolutional neural\nnetwork \(sec.

Furthermore, we\nchose a data split of 5 for a 5-fold cross validation and hence\ncarried out ?ve different experiments with every data set.\nA. The Ground Penetrating Radar Data Set\nThe GPR data set consists of 10 radargrams. From these\nradargrams we got 2707 manually labeled examples – gained\nby a modi?cation of a clustering approach \(GamRec, [6],\n[8 shaped areas within an image\n– composed of 1166 hyperbola and 1541 noise examples. In\nthe archived example set we identi?ed 5 different hyperbola\nand 5 different noise types with different shapes. Hence,\nevery example is assigned to one of 10 classes to respect\nthe different shape types \(see ?g. 4 ensemble were trained with this 10 classes in\nour experiments. The 2 main classes \(hyperbola, noise were\nconsidered only in the end by counting examples assigned\nto class 0, . . . , 4 as hyperbolas and examples assigned to\nclass 5, . . . , 9 as noise. For stacking ensemble and HNNP\nalso every network was trained with the 10 classes except\nthe subsequent multilayer perceptron nn0. nn0 distincts only\nbetween the 2 main classes Although the ?nal results are\nbinary, the 10 subclasses are needed for training to reduce\nthe large intra-class variance within the 2 main classes, as it\ncannot be covered by the small amount of train examples.\nThe average sizes of train and test set for the 5 splits are\n2166 and 541. Additionally to the images we have chosen\n2 further information sources: statistical information \(input\nfor nn1 speci?c information \(input for nn2 cluster pixels occurring in one of 16 areas of\nthe cluster image \(partitioned by a 4 × 4 grid the\nother hand the numbers of cluster pixels with 0, 1, 2, ... or\n8 neighbors, resulting in 25 features. The domain speci?c\ninformation delivers 8 features concerning the GPR image\nand the original clusters found in this image.\nB. The Synthetic Aperture Radar Data Set\nFor the SAR data set we have chosen 5 images of the\nMagellan data set.

classi?cation decision. The stacking ensemble in\ncontrast learns how – with which weighting – to interpret\nthe outputs of the involved networks. Hence, in table III\nwe compared HNNP only with the state-of-the-art neural\nnetwork cnn and the stronger stacking ensemble. Table III\nshows that on average HNNP reached an error reduction\nof approximately 40% and 52% in comparison to the cnn\napplied to the GPR and the SAR data set and an error\nreduction of approximately 13% and 17% in comparison\nto the stacking ensemble. HNNP performs better than the\nstacking ensemble, as stacking corresponds to only one\nlayer of networks whereas HNNP contains several network\nlayers for retraining, in which also the single networks learn\nhow to consider the classi?cation decisions of the other\nnetworks. The networks within the plait perform better after\nretraining and commit their improved classi?cation result\nto the networks in the following layer. In this way, the\nclassi?cation error is more and more improved over the\nplait layers until the classi?cation skills of the networks are\nexhaustively merged. The results of our experiments show\nthat for the considered data sets stacking ensemble is not\nsuf?cient and a retraining in plait layers delivers further\n28\nclassi?cation improvements. In summary, we compared our\napproach to ?ve baselines, each of which was outperformed\nby HNNP. Especially in comparison to the state-of-the-art\napproch cnn and the stronger ensemble method stacking\nHNNP reached a signi?cant error reduction.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we addressed the problem of applying\nlearning models for classi?cation to small noisy data sets.\nWe presented a hybrid neural network plait architecture\n\(HNNP which is able to improve the classi?cation perfor-\nmance in such data sets in comparison to applying a single\nconvolutional neural network or ensemble methods to them.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work is co-funded by the EFRE project AcoGPR.\nREFERENCES\n[1] K.

FINAL REMARKS\nIn this paper we presented an approach for supporting the\nenergy-aware adaptation of business processes at design time\ndriven by an optimization problem that takes into account both\ninfrastructural, applicative, and environmental standpoints. In\nparticular, the adaptation actions available to the application\ndesigner rely on the de?nition of variants for the tasks com-\nposing the business process.\nThis approach is now heavily based on the assumption that\nmonitored data about previous executions are available, and\ninformation able to give the values for the interesting metrics\nare all included in this knowledge base. For future development\nof our approach, we aim to relax this assumption, trying to\nunderstand if we can infer the values of the metrics in case\nthe data needed to compute them analytically are not present.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work has been supported by the ECO2Clouds project\n\(http://eco2clouds.eu activity of the 7th Framework\nProgramme under contract number 318048.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Greenpeace, “How Clean Is Your Cloud?,” tech. rep., 04 2012.\n[2] A.

PARTITIONING SCHEME \nIn this section, we describe some additional details of the \npartitioning schemes. For a given n nodes and P processors, \nwe create P partitions Vo, V1 , . . .  Vp-1 . The processors are \nlabeled as 0, 1 ,  . . .  P - 1. Partition Vi is processed by pro­\ncessor i. For each scheme, we need to know i of nodes in each partition, and iii Below we show how to calculate them for the three \npartitioning schemes. \nA.1 Uniform Consecutive Partitioning UCP assigned to the par­\ntitions. \nPartition size: The sizes of the partitions are almost equal. \nLet B = I f5 l Then, the size of a partition is either B or \nB -1. \nPartition range: Partition i includes the nodes from iB nto \(i  + I III J . \nA.2 Linear Consecutive Partitioning \(LCP par­\ntitions, and the number of nodes in the partitions are mod­\neled by arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d a+\(P- l are partition pal'ame­\nters. At the end of this section, we discuss how a and d are \ndetermined. \nPartition range: Partition i has the nodes from L;:? \(a+ \njd 2a+\(?-1 a + jd i + 1 2a?id 1 .  \nFinding processor rank: Given a node u ,  we need to \nfind the partition i such that u E Vi, Node u satisfies the \nfollowing inequality: \ni-I \nl 2a + \(i - l i + 1 2a id 11 pa­\nrameters a and d are determined using the number of nodes \nn and the number of processors P. Parameter d 


is the slope \nof the straight line y = a + dx, where y represent the num­\nber of nodes in the processor with rank x = i. We calcu­\nlate d by finding two points on this straight line. Putting \ni = 0 and i = P -1 in Eqn 10, we can compute nl and \nnp- l .  Then, the number of nodes in the first processor is \nnl - no = nl and the number of nodes in last processor is \nnp - np- l = n - 1 - np- l .  Hence, we have \nNow, we have \nd = \nn - 1 np- l - nl \nP \n. \nP- l \n2 2a + \(P - l P - l Round Robin Partitioning \n\(12 partitions, the number of nodes is almost \nequal for all partitions. Similar to UCP scheme, the size of \na partition is either I f5 l  or I f5 l  - 1. \nPartition range: For round robin partitioning, partition i \nhas the nodes i, i + P, i + 2P, . . .  i + \(B - l parti­\ntion i is determined by i = u mod P. \nComputation load: The expected number of request mes­\nsages received for node k is \(Hn- 1  - Hk see Lemma 3.4 load \nfor node k is CL\(k Hn- 1  - Hk with partition Vi = {j Ij \nmod P = i} is PL\(i Hn- 1  - Hk + b CL\(k1 k2 i l i2 between the loads of two processors is \nPL\(O P -1 Hn- 1  - Hk + b Hn- 1  - Hk + b kEVp_ l  \nS \(Hn- 1  + b 1 V0 1 - l Vp- 1 1 l i = 0, \nkEVrl kEVp_ l  \nL Hk < L Hk + Hn , \nk EVp_ l  kEVrl \nand thus, PL\(O P -1 log n nOtherwise, \n1 V0 1 - l Vp- 1 1 = 1, \nL Hk S L Hk ,  \nk EVp_ l  k EVo \nand thus, PL\(O P -1 O\(log n

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration.

The measurement range is important to defme \nthe 5th or 6th degree polynomial used to convert the 8-bit \ndigital words in telemetry back to analog telemetry so the \ntelemetry processing and display system can accurately \ndisplay the biological and engineering diagnostic \ninformation to ground personnel for analysis. \n1 7  \nTable 3 .

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
