1 Background 
Cloud Computing is a kind of implementation vir the Internet anytime, anywhere and on-demand access to a shared resource pool of computing model. Shared pool of resources includes computing facilities, storage devices, and applications and so on 1  NIST defines four types of cloud computing deployment models: public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud and community cloud 2  In a hybrid cloud model, basic IT resources belong to different institutions, organizations or individuals. Different 
institutions, organizations or individuals may have different resource management strategies, different types of resources and services used. In order to eliminate these isomers, the establishment of a comprehensive and complete resource management model to manage the hybrid IaaS cloud platform inside and outside of basic IT resources configuration, flow and integration, is very necessary  In recent years, compared with the use of private cloud or public cloud alone in the problems of utilizing cloud services efficiency, convenience and elasticity, people have begun to realize hybrid IaaS cloud platform has a natural advantage Hybrid IaaS cloud environment, however, there are still many problems need to be resolved, such as when basic IT resources allocate flow in different institutions, organizations or individuals ,it faces with the problem of resource scheduling 
This paper adopts AHP model to solve basic IT resource scheduling strategy problem under the hybrid cloud environment, and introduce the SLA mechanism to ensure the QoS of the user 
 
Basic resources in the cloud computing is heterogeneous geographically distributed, especially in the hybrid cloud platform, this heterogeneous degree is more deeply, but  cloud computing need to integrate these resources through virtualization technology to deliver services to outside Therefore, the mechanism on the basics of the principle of operational research is an effective solution to the scheduling problem. Such dynamic ,coordinate mechanism is appropriate for cloud resource. Resource scheduling is a NP problem, and a

operation and laws of the market, have the different roles in cloud computing deals respectively defined as cloud resource providers, consumers, and the cloud bank \(CB\ which come from one or more different cloud \(private cloud , public cloud or community cloud\under the premise that retain their own characteristics, framework by standardized or proprietary technology to bind together to form the overall, so that the best interests of all parties involved to get,  a hybrid cloud architecture. The resource transaction management model is mainly divided into the following five layers: physical resource pool, service level agreement \(SLA\l, risk resistance resource scheduling, pricing strategy. The following will mainly introduce CB-SLA pool and resource scheduling 1 9 
 
CB-SLA pool To make the cloud bank born can provide more high quality 
IT services than other cloud model, how to guarantee QoS is the most important and it urgent need a good solution. SLA is the best tool to describe QoS parameters, which involves the level of availability, service capabilities, performance, operation and other service attributes, such as bookkeeping. Cloud Bank SLA is designed using a formal way to capture service agreement in a cloud bank environment   All of the information described above can be measured and converted to the standard available information by CB-SLA system. In the cloud banks, SLA system is no longer just the traditional sense of a tool to protect the quality of service, but rather an information conversion, collection, sorting and delivery systems. CB-SLA is an essential part of the cloud bank

and supports the other components in the cloud banks properly and smoothly running  2 9 Resource allocation In the field of distributed computing, how to effectively schedule resources between computing nodes and at the same time gurantee QoS is a traditional problem. For this NP-hard problem, currently there is not a universal solution that applies to all distributed scenario. In order to meet the demand of resource consumers, this paper adopts the resource scheduling strategy based on AHP model to effectively conveniently schedule basic computing resources in the cloud bank environment Resource providers are also known as resource producers and the requestors of initiating resources and service requirements are called resource consumers in the cloud bank environment. Cloud bank model components include consumers, resource user agent \(CCA\ cloud bank \(CB\, the resource provider agent \(CRA\ producers CCA accept the resource application task from consumers upload the task to the cloud bank, and instead of consumers and cloud bank to establish the SLA agreements. These SLA agreements need to include the task ending time, QoS attributes and other parameters. CRA accept the task application that producers put its own resources into the cloud bank, and quantify and pricing, then instead of producers signed SLA agreements with the cloud bank, and utilize the SLA agreements registering resource price, resource execution efficiency and the waiting time of resource scheduling and other parameters into the cloud bank In the big environment of cloud bank, the SLA agreement is established between resource consumers and the cloud bank These SLA agreements need to include the task ending time QoS attributes and other parameters. The SLA agreement is also established between resource producers and the cloud bank utilizing the SLA agreements registering resource price resource execution efficiency and the waiting time of resource scheduling and other parameters into the cloud bank. The resources are also producers SLA agreements with cloud banks to establish and use SLA agreement will perform resource prices and resource efficiency and resource scheduling parameters such as the waiting time when registered into the cloud bank. So how to utilize these parameters, allocate the best resource for the user, to achieve the optimal combination matching, and on this basis, make the total task ending time shortest? Here we present AHP model Analytic Hierarchy Process Model \(referred AHP\ is a simple, flexible and practical multi-criteria decision making model, proposed by an American operational researcher professor T.L.Saaty in the early 1970s. The decision problem is divided into three levels: the object layer 0, criterion layer C solution layer P. Each layer has a number of elements, the relationship between the elements of each layer is connected with the straight line. Though mutual comparison we can determine the weight of each criterion to the object, and the weight of each solution to each criterion. The above two sets of weights are integrated to determine the weight of each solution to the object, to select the maximum weight value as the best solutions of the object. AHP let qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis combine to complete the above steps, the quantitative results are given to the decision problem  Below is a selection model of tourist sites: how to choose the best destination in three destinations according to scenery fees, housing, diet and other factors The AHP model can also be used for resource scheduling in cloud computing According to the SLA agreement of resource consumers and parameters of the CPU, memory, disk storage, bandwidth I/0 devices, determine the preference relationship of resource consumers to each parameter \(preference data given below is changed from qualitative into quantitative nd acco rding to the SLA agreement of resource providers, determine the preference relationship of the virtual computing node preference relationship to each parameter. Then establish AHP model Regard resource consumer demands as the object layer O Regard the parameter CPU, the memory, storage disks bandwidth, I/O device as the criterion layer C. Regard the virtual computing nodes   as the solution layer P Then for the object to find the best solution, that is scheduling the best resource for the userês needs First, according to the preference relations, conduct pairwise comparison between the elements of the criterion layer Comparing adopts the relative scale to build a pairwise comparison matrix compare the importance of each criterion    for the object O   At this point the matrix A is both a pairwise comparison matrix and a positive reciprocal matrix. The weight vector of to O is determined by matrix A The can be obtained however 7, so the matrix A is inconsistent. Solution for our re quirements, allow A inconsistent but need to meet the inconsistent allowable range Following let us investigate the case of fully consistent Suppose \002 002 002 so that 002 can be obtained

Fig.2  Tasks completion time comparision 
DataCenterBroker realize resource discovery and information interaction, is the core of the simulation scheduling, the proposed algorithm is implemented mainly in DataCenterBroker Experimental environment: utilize random simulator to get  form A, assigned tasks to five virtual computing nodes, change the number of tasks from 10 to 100, record the task completion time \(ms\ and compare with known GA algorithm Comparing two kinds of resource scheduling strategies, the results is shown as below As can be seen from figure 2, this paperês method makes the task completion time shorter. It shows that the AHP model is a good resource scheduling strategy In the cloud computing business model, the user's QoS has become extremely important, so to ensure the user's QoS, meet userês requirements, is a long-term solution of cloud computing The AHP model presented in this paper not only has the advantage of the natural ensuring userês QoS, but also has the advantage of distributed concurrent operation. Regardless of how many tasks, parameters, virtual computing nodes, task execution only can be divided into two steps under the AHP model. The first step is to calculate the weight time-consuming and the second step is the combination weights time-consuming Due to the structured paired comparison matrix is not ordinary matrix, it has great flexibility and regularity, simplifying the calculation, making the time complexity of algorithm greatly less than which will greatly reduces the task execution time. The AHP model also has the advantages of a clear structure and solving the problem of qualitative. Although maybe there are some gray reasons, causing preference relations deviation, generally speaking, the AHP model is an ideal resource scheduling strategy This paper is supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China 2010 \(No.61063044\ and by the laboratory in Software Engineering of Yunnan Province under Grant \(No.210KS05\.
