Firstly defuzzify all expected outputs with regards to target stage 2,1        1 1 ni W WmW Adefuzz n j jA n j jjA i i i        4  where jWm is the centre value of expected interval of target stage in historical dataset. Secondly, the estimated effort is calculated by computing the weight average of defuzzification values. The weight here is confidence ratio of extracted rules as shown in Eq. 5 For example suppose we want to predict specification stage of a project. Consider prior stage is software plan phase and its effort value is located in 


the first interval \(EP1 following rules have been extracted EP1=>ES4 \(confidence= 0.932 EP1=>ES3 \(confidence= 0.843 EP1=>ES1 \(confidence= 0.78 Then corresponding Fuzzy sets that represent expected target stage based on previous rules should be defuzzfied. From this example we can observe that the input interval has many relations with target intervals i.e. EP1 has three significant relations with ES4, ES3 and ES2 in the specification phase. Therefore we need to take their impacts on the final estimate. The effort for specification phase stage is calculated as following      k i i k i ii confidencerule confidenceruleAdefuzz E 1 1   5 where k is the number of rules  15.000  1 5.0 0 0  43214    WmWmWmWm Adefuzz ES

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The dataset used in empirical validation came from ISBSG [24]. The obtained dataset contains effort records for six phases are: plan effort \(EP specification effort \(ES ED effort \(EB ET effort \(EI processing we attempted to select the most representative data, therefore we ignored the projects records that contain missing values Determining the possible number of intervals in each stage is carried out based on the distribution of effort data in each stage as shown in Figures 1 to 6 There is no clear mechanism for how to determine the 


perfect number of intervals therefore we attempted to study density of data for each stage separately. The performed analysis resulted in different number of intervals between stages. The obtained number of intervals reflects the density and range of data in each stage as shown in Table I. For Association rule mining the minimum support is set by 0.01 and minimum confidence is set by 0.8. These values have been carefully chosen to avoid too few rules that would occur if the confidence was very high The theme of this paper is to address the following arising issue: can project manager relay on prior effort records to predict next stage effort? To answer this question, the proposed model has been evaluated using jack-knifing method. We used 34 projects with complete effort records. The complete procedure of experiment is described below 1. Project number i is removed from data set as test project \(i.e. for which the stage estimate is required 2. The proposed procedure applied on the remaining projects 3. Making prediction for the test project, and MRE and residuals of test project is recorded 4. Project i, which had been removed from the data set is added back Table II and Table III depict the results obtained by our proposed approach compared to exponential regression where target stage is regarded as dependent variable and all pervious stages as independent variables Table II we can observe that all outputs tend to be under estimation. Three out of five stages producing good estimate are specification, building and testing while design stage produced better results compared to implementation stage \(which produced the worst stage effort estimation in terms of MMRE related to that the ISBSG is scattered as result of collection from different worldwide companies. The effort records have complex structure in which there is no consistent structure for all effort records. Based on MdMRE we can observe that our approach in most of stages produced comparable estimation accuracy with maximum 30.2% in implementation stage

The best estimation accuracy was obtained in building stage, which also corroborates our findings that best estimation accuracy was in building stage. The negative values in Bias criterion show underestimation. It is acknowledged that MMRE is unbalanced in many validation circumstances and leads to overestimation more than underestimation. In our case, we found that MMRE leads to underestimation in most stages. This is may be related to the absence of systematic scheme between all prior effort records   253   Figure 1.

MMREs of our approach have been reduced by at least 35.05 and at most 93%. Biases have been reduced by at least 3.5% and at most 159%.We have to bear in mind that the length of interval plays important role in estimation accuracy, thus, when the universe of discourse is partitioned into several equal intervals, the distribution of data should be taken into account. Moreover, we should remove the extreme values because they affect interval partitioning, thus, estimation accuracy Figures 7 to 11 show comparison between proposed approach and exponential regression in each stage by using Boxplot. The Boxplot [17] offers a way to compare between estimation models based on their absolute residuals. The Boxplot is non-parametric statistics used to show the median as central tendency of distribution, interquartile range and the outliers of individual models [17]. The length of Boxplot from 


lower tail to upper tail shows the spread of the distribution. The length of box represents the interquartile range that contains 50% of observations The position of median inside the box and length of Boxplot indicate the skewness of distribution. A Boxplot with a small box and long tails represents a very peaked distribution while a Boxplot with long box represents a flatter distribution. The prominent and common characteristic among these figures is the spread of absolute residuals for our approach is less than spread of exponential regression which presents more accurate results. The larger interquartile of exponential regression indicates a high dispersion of the absolute residuals. The Boxplot revealed that the box length for our models is smaller than exponential regression which also indicates reduced variability of absolute residuals. The median of our model is smaller than median of exponential regression which revealed that at least half of the predictions of our model are more accurate than exponential regression 254  Figure 7. Boxplot of absolute residuals for the specification stage  Figure 8. Boxplot of absolute residuals for the design stage   Figure 9. Boxplot of absolute residuals for the building stage Figure 10. Boxplot of absolute residuals for the testing stage   The lower tails of our model is much smaller than upper tail which means the absolute residuals are skewed towards the smaller value Figure 11 illustrates the reason of why prediction of implementation stage in our approach produced the worst accuracy. The reason related to the existing of outlier. Although one project is considered as an outlier the MMRE is easily influenced with that project Based on the obtained results, we can observe that 


exponential regression gave bad accuracy. The reason may relate to the structure complexity of prior effort records. There is no correlation between all prior stages and target stage To ensure that the results obtained are not by chance we investigated the statistical significance of the proposed approach using Wilcoxon sum rank test for absolute residuals as shown in Table IV. In this test if the resulting p-value is small \(p<0.05 statistically significant difference can be accepted between the two samples median. The residuals obtained using the proposed approach were significantly different from those obtained by exponential regression Suggesting that, there is difference if the predications generated using the proposed approach or exponential regression and based on the accuracy comparison in Tables II and III we can safely conclude that our proposed method outperformed exponential regression for stage effort estimation Figure 11. Boxplot of absolute residuals for the implementation stage  VIII. CONCLUSIONS Some of software projects are failed due to the absence of re-estimation during software development which results in huge gap between initial plan and final outcome. Even with good estimate at first stage the project manager must keep update with project progress and should be able to re-estimate the project at any particular point of project in order to re-allocate the proper number of resources. The objective of this paper was to check whether the prior effort records can 255 be used to predict stage effort with reasonable accuracy or not. The obtained results revealed that using association rule and Fuzzy set theory lead to significant improvement in stage-effort estimation and give project manager an evolving picture about project progress. Comparing our approach with exponential regression showed that there is a considerable potential in estimation accuracy. As part of future plan, we 


intend to expand this work to involve some interesting features in each stage prediction and evaluate it on many datasets   REFERENCES  1] F. Ricardo, N. Ana, M. Paula, B. Gleidson, R.

encountering a related term, i.e. IC\(c e intuition behind the use of the negative likelihood is that the more probable a term to appear, the less information it conveys. All these features show that Jiangs measure tends to be more general and more appropriate for evaluating nontaxonomically related terms. Indeed, a high score of the relatedness measures suggests a strong relationship between terms Nevertheless, all relatedness measures have limitations because they assume that all the semantic content of a particular term is modeled by semantic links in WordNet Consequently, in many situations, truly related terms obtain a low scores even though their belongings to a certain category of tags, e.g., jargon tags Additionally, when measuring the quality of an automatically knowledge acquisition results, the typical measures used in Information Retrieval are Recall, Precision and F-Measure. However, computing Recall and F-Measure requires the availability of a Gold Standard. Hence, we will only compute the Precision which speci?es to which extent the non-taxonomic relationships is extracted correctly. In this case, the ratio between the correctly extracted relations i.e., their relatedness measures is greater than or equal to a minimum threshold, and the whole number of extracted ones is computed. Thus, we have Precision Total correctly selected entities Total selected entities 12 http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-Similarity 13 A term refers to a tag subject or a tag object C. Evaluation of non-taxonomic relationships Only a percentage of the full set of non-taxonomic relationships \(89 is caused by the presence of non standard terms which are not contained in WordNet and, in consequence, cannot be evaluated using WordNet-based relatedness measures. Fig. 5 depicts the evaluation results of the extracted non-taxonomic relationships against their relatedness measures High relatedness score \(88 17% of the extracted relationships, as most of terms are strongly related with respect WordNet Null Scores were obtained for 5% of the extracted 


relationships. Analyzing this case in more detail, we have observed that the poor score is caused in many situations by the way in which Jiangs distance metric works. This latter completely depends on the distance between two terms based on the number of edges found on the path between them in WordNet. In consequence this measure returns a value that does not fully represent reality. For example, on the one hand, Jiangs distance metric returns a null value for the relationship between insurance and car, even though the ?rst is a commonly related to the second, i.e., car involved insurance Finally with a minimal Jiangs distance metric threshold, set to 46%, the computed precision of correctly extracted relationships candidates is equal to 68.8 An example of extracted non-taxonomic relationships is depicted in Table V where each relation describes the subject tag, e.g., tool, the predicate, e.g is being developed within, and the object tag, e.g mesh. Fig. 4 represent a fragment output of the extracted ontological structure where each concept de?nes a set of similar and synonym tags and labels, i.e., mentions has been, revealed, caused and is created with describe the predicates of the non-taxonomic relationships between terms Due to the limitations observed by the automatic evaluation procedure and the lack of gold standards containing non-taxonomic relationships, we have examined the extracted non-taxonomic relationships from a linguistic point 377 Top space      distance     quad great     groovy nifty caused address      addresses extension      quotation   reference  references extensions        referenz     source      refrence sources    rfrences    quotations research    search     searching searchs open-source     open_source

This qualitative evaluation can bring some interesting insights about the kind of results one can expect Invalid relations are extracted: Even though a relation such as music cities skill is considered as correct one since tag subject, tag object and predicate are correctly extracted. From a semantic point of view, this relation has no meaning. Hence, a higher precision is expected Figure 5.

obtained results VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK The extraction of non-taxonomic relationships from folksonomies is to the best of our knowledge is the least tackled task within ontology building from folksonomy. This is why there is a need of novel and general purpose approaches covering the full process of learning relationships. In this paper, we introduced a new approach called NONTAXFOLKS that starts by pre-processing tags aiming at getting a set of frequent tagsets corresponding to an agreed representation Then, they are used to retrieve related tags using external resources such as WordNet. Thanks to the particular structure of triadic concepts, it allows grouping semantically related tags by considering the semantic relatedness embodied in the different frequencies of co-occurences among users, resources and tags in the folksonomy. Thereafter we introduced an algorithm called NTREXTRACTION for extracting non-taxonomic relationships between pair of tags picked from the triadic concepts. In summary, our approach uses several well known techniques \(such as formal concept analysis or association rule discovering the social bookmaring environnement in order to propose a new way of extracting labeled non-taxonomic relationships between tags. Currently, we are investigating the following topic concerning the discovered predicates between two terms. Indeed, in order to avoid relationships redundancy and thus a redundancy in the builded ontology. One can try to classify them into prede?ned semantic classes, detect synonyms, inverses, etc. A standard classi?cation of verbs could be used for this purpose, adding additional information about the semantic content, e.g., senses, verb types, thematic roles, etc., of predicates relationships 378 REFERENCES 1] J.
