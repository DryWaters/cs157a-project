providers. Finally, the De-\npartment of Defense was excluded as a stakeholder, based on\ninformation constraints. It is anticipated that national security\nstakeholders will be included in later classified variants of this\neffort.\nPreviously, stakeholders network models were used to iden-\ntify the relative priority of stakeholders. These models com-\npute the value delivery to NASA by stakeholders \(including\npotentially indirect paths network topology stakehold-\ners self-identified need strength. These models have the\nadvantage of not explicitly requiring a prioritization of stake-\nholders, instead producing this prioritization as an output.\nThe model described in this paper will initially use a prioriti-\nzation among stakeholders, and will later evolve to compute\nstakeholder prioritization as a function of the network model.\nThe list of stakeholders is provided in Table 1. A three\npage stakeholder questionnaire was developed in order to\npopulate the needs and satisfaction functions of the model,\nas well as to elicit potential other needs. Quantitative survey\nquestions focus on data rates, latency, data volume per day\n\(for each of science, housekeeping and forward services tracking services and accuracy required. Additionally,\nqualitative questions are asked, including the stakeholders’\nrelative priority of network FOMs \(such as data rate, quality\nof service, data integrity, etc as well as their opinion of\nwhether any of their requirements will drive or strongly\ninfluence the architecture.\nTo date, interviews have been conducted with nine stake-\nholder representatives, with data collection on going. In\naddition to these nine representatives, extensive consultation\nwith existing TDRS operators has been conducted, as proxies\nfor some of the stakeholders.\n6. TRADESPACE MODELING\nArchitectural decisions\nA SCAN architecture is modeled as the set of architectural\ndecisions presented in Table 2. Thus, in order to fully\n5\ndefine an architecture, it is necessary to choose one option\nfor each of the decisions shown in Table 2. In the rest of\nthis subsection, each of these decisions is described in more\ndetail.\nOrbit and constellation design—The selection of the orbital\nparameters of the spacecraft, as well as the constellation\nparameters in case of a constellation, will largely determine\nthe coverage of the constellation i.e., the frequency and\nduration of accesses that can be provided to users in different\norbital positions. It will also drive cost for several reasons:\n1 constellation\n2 achieve that orbit\nfrom a given launch site\n3 especially on orbit altitude, due to the varying effect\nof atmospheric drag, radiation, magnetic field illumination\nconditions and so forth on the design of the spacecraft \(see\nSection 6 for more details orbit is perfectly defined by six parameters which can take\ncontinuous values; therefore there are in theory an infinity of\ndifferent orbits. For the purposes of this architecting tool,\nonly four families of orbits are considered, at least at this\nstage: Low Earth Orbit \(LEO GEO MEO HEO families of relatively similar orbits, a set\nof paradigmatic orbital parameters needs to be assumed for\neach one in order to make computations with them. These\nparameters are provided in Table 3.\nIn addition to the orbital parameters, it is necessary to de-\nfine the constellation parameters. For LEO orbits, the tool\nassumes constellations of np planes of identical a, e, i, and\n?, evenly distributed in ?, and ns satellites per plane evenly\ndistributed in mean anomaly. For the purpose of this piece of\nanalysis, only 1 ? np ? 4 and 1 ? ns ? 4 are considered.\nThis yields a total of 4 options for orbit type, and 16 options\nfor constellation design, i.e 64 unconstrained options for\norbit and constellation design, of which 12 are non-sensical\nbecause it is not possible to have np > 1 for GEO.\nDesign of communication payloads—The payload selection\ndecision concerns the selection of the band and the types - and\nnot the number - of communications payloads. The ”type” of\npayload refers to the type of architecture implemented: bent-\npipe vs circuit-switched vs packet-switched. The importance\nof this distinction depends strongly on specific characteristics\nof the traffic \(e.g. its burstiness but the three options will be part of the tradespace\nfor this study.\nThe band of the payload is important because it fixes most\nof the performance: data rates are largely driven by band\nselection. For example, high data rates beyond 512Mbps\nare only achievable by high bands \(i.e. Ka or beyond be important, as frequency\nallocation is severely controlled by international organisms.\nThe payload selection decision has 2Nbands?1 options, where\nNbands is the number of bands that are being considered.\nHence, for S-band, X-band, Ku-band, Ka-band, V-band, and\noptical, we have 63 options.\nPayload-to-spacecraft allocation—The payload-to-spacecraft\nallocation decision concerns the allocation of the payloads to\nspacecraft, and therefore it depends on the payload selection\ndecision \(one cannot allocate payloads to satellites unless the\npayloads have been selected

For example, for a\ncertain architecture with three payloads selected \(S-band, Ka-\nband, optical 3 5 options for\nthe payload-to-spacecraft allocation decision, namely:\nA1\(3 sats optical}}\nA2\(2 sats 2 sats 2 sats Ka}}\nA5\(1 sat 1 problem is mostly related to the cost of the archi-\ntecture, and it is unlikely to affect its performance beyond the\nfact that payload have to share resources from a common bus,\nwhich they can do up to a certain level where the design of the\nbus becomes too costly or simply infeasible. The absence of\npositive and negative interactions between payloads \(beyond\nthose due to limitations of resources on the spacecraft characteristic of communication systems, which does not\nhold in general for other systems. For instance, in Earth ob-\nservation satellite systems, strong positive synergies or neg-\native interferences often appear between instruments which\nmay play a key role in the payload-to-spacecraft allocation\nproblem [19].\nContract modality—The payloads and buses of the current\nTDRSS architecture were procured from commercial sup-\npliers and they are operated by NASA. In this approach,\nNASA retains most if not all of the control on the design\nand operation of the payload and the spacecraft. On the\nother hand, they have to pay for the whole cost of developing\nand fabricating the spacecraft \(payloads and buses them.\nSince then, alternative schemes have become available. The\nmost notorious example is the ”hosted payloads” approach,\nin which a spacecraft owner sells fractions of their space-\ncraft resources \(mass, power volume, data rate usually years, with programs such as Iridium\nNext [20]. The reasons for its popularity are obvious: the\nhosted payload owner must only pay for the payload and a\n”service fee” that accounts for a fraction of the spacecraft\ndevelopment, fabrication, integration, testing, and launch\ncosts. This ”service fee” can be a function of a number of\nparameters including, but not limited to, the mass, power,\nand dimensions of the hosted payload. On the other hand,\nthe hosted payload owner \(i.e., NASA in this case control over the design and operation of the spacecraft.\nExactly what part of the control is lost, and how costly is\nthis ”service fee” is still an open question as the first hosted\npayload contracts have only been signed in the last few years.\nThe concept of hosted payloads is an instance of a cost shar-\n6\nTable 2 Architectural decisions\nDecision Range of values # options\nPayload band selection Any combination of the following: S-, X-, Ku-, Ka-, V-band\nand optical\n2Nbands ? 1 = 63\nPayload type selection bent-pipe vs circuit-switched vs packet-switched 3\nPayload-to-spacecraft allocation All the possible partitions of Ninstr instruments into 1 ?\nNsat ?

Canonical orbit parameters\nOrbit Semimajor axis\na\(km deg deg deg anomaly\n?\(deg abstraction that can be generalized. This abstraction is as\nfollows: let a proxy for the lifecycle cost of a communications\nconstellation consists of payload cost, bus cost, launch cost,\nand operations cost. Then, the classic NASA procurement\napproach corresponds to a scheme where payload cost, bus\ncost, launch cost, and operations cost are all entirely paid\nfor by NASA. Analogously, the hosted payloads approach\ncorresponds to a scheme where NASA pays entirely for the\npayload cost, but only for a fraction of bus, launch, and\noperations cost. It is conceivable that other contract modal-\nities can be devised that are hybrids of these approaches as\nsuggested in Table 4. In particular, there are 42 = 16 different\npossible contract modalities, although arguably only a subset\nof these are plausible options. For example, it is unlikely\nthat NASA would fully pay for the development of a next\ngeneration TDRS payload and bus and then let it be launched\nand operated by an external entity, however similar in nature\nthis could be to what has happened in the Earth observation\nrealm between NASA and NOAA.\nAfter conversations with communications experts at NASA,\nit was decided to keep only options 0: 100% procurement, 7:\nhosted payloads, and 15: 100% commercial in the tradespace.\nThe details of how the ”service fee” is computed for all\noptions \(except for option 0 for which the service fee is 0\nby definition enumerating\nall the possible architectures defined by the decisions and\noptions outlined in the previous section. If we consider the\nsets of options identified for each decision, the architectural\ntradespace is thus simply defined by the Cartesian product of\nall these sets.

architectures for\nthe SCaN program can be automatically enumerated and\nevaluated using this tool.\nPerformance model\nThe performance model intends to capture the ability of the\nnetwork to satisfy a set of stakeholders given their relative\nimportance and expected missions. It aims to \(a network and \(b structure of the performance model.\nModeling the network topology— The first step to model\na space relay network is understanding the movement of\nboth backbone nodes and end users over a representative\nperiod of time. This information is needed so as to define\nthe contact opportunities between them and therefore assess\nwhen a particular path between an origin and a destination is\navailable.\nThe performance model uses STK9 in order to simulate the\nmovement of both the space and ground segment. For each\nconstellation, the following parameters can be input:\n\(1 plane.\n\(2 3 satellite identifiers on the STK\ndatabase \(SatId1, ..., SatIdN 3 constellation of satel-\nlites by directly importing their orbital information from the\ndatabase \(\(1 2 are ignored 1 2 spacecraft both in latitude and longitude.

Structure of the performance model\nstations. In this case, one can input their Earth coordinates or\ntheir STK database identifier.\nOnce all the nodes of the network have been put in place,\nthe next step is to define the FOV of their antennas. This\nis done by appending sensors to each satellite and ground\nstation and specifying their conical angle with respect to the\nnadir or zenith direction. Choosing between the nadir and\nzenith orientation is generally not trivial and depends on the\nrelative position of the two communicating nodes. The model\nsolves that problem by letting STK compute the four possible\ncombinations \(two for the transmitting antenna and two more\nfor the receiving antenna that\nindicates the contact times between pairs of network nodes.\nThese are parsed into a three dimensional binary matrix C ?\nMNxNxT where N indicates the number of network nodes\nand T the number of simulated time intervals \(or snapshots t, t+ ?t]. In turn, ?t is computed as\n?t =\nTotal simulation time = ?T\nNumber of time intervals = T\n\(3 also used to compute the distances for contacts\nbetween nodes on the network. This information is used\ntogether with the communication payload transmitting power,\nmodulation, coding and data rate as well as the antennae gain\nand G/T in order to calculate an estimate for all the link\nbudgets. The result is again a binary three dimensional matrix\nLB ? MNxNxT that indicates if a particular link is viable at\na given time interval. For communication payloads that do\nnot have a specified transmitting frequency and bandwidth, a\nset of RF spectrum rules are used in order to determine them.\nTheir goal is to encode the current ITU and NTIA regulations\nso as to ensure that a communication link is only possible\nif a given frequency band has some amount of bandwidth\nallocated for a particular type of link.\nOn the other hand, a set of rules is used in order to assess the\ncommunication links that are logically viable. For instance, a\nrelay system based on a bent-pipe architecture like TDRSS\ndoes not have intersatellite links regardless of the relative\nposition between spacecrafts. However, since both C and LB\ntake only into consideration physical and RF/optical param-\neters, they might validate links between spacecrafts that are\nin field of view of each another and close enough to satisfy\nthe link budget equations. In order to prevent that, the link\nrules determine what links are logically viable between two\nnodes of the network. The output of these rules is a two\ndimensional binary matrix LL ? MNxN where LLij = 1\nindicates that link from node i to node j is logically viable.\nThis LL matrix is repeated for all time intervals in order to\nobtain LL ?MNxNxT .\nFinally, once matrices C, LB and LL have been computed the\noverall network topology can be directly inferred as NT =\nC&LB&LL. This matrix will take into account the orbital\nmechanics of the nodes, the physical layer of the network and\nlogical restrictions of the architecture so as to indicate the\nviable links at each time interval. As a result, it will capture\nthe network topology at any instant in time.\nModeling the network schedule— The communication re-\nquirements for a particular mission depend both on its con-\ncept of operations and the demanded services As an exam-\nple, an Earth observation mission might require a science data\n8\nreturn service that intends to use three 5 minute contacts per\norbit in order to return a total data volume of 200 GB/day.\nAlternatively, the International Space Station might require a\nvideo service four times a day with a duration of 15 minutes\neach 


contact.\nIn order to accommodate all the expected customers, a re-\nlay network has to determine how to optimally allocate its\nresources. This can be done through a scheduling algorithm\nthat indicates what users and services will be supported at\na given moment in time. This schedule is built taking into\nconsideration at least three parameters:\n• The network topology, i.e. what links are available at each\nmoment of time. This information has already been computed\nand is stored in the matrix NT.\n• The user and service priorities. They will indicate what\nusers and services are more important and therefore must be\nscheduled first. This information is an input to the model.\n• The concept of operations for a particular user and service:\nnumber of contacts, data volume to return per contact, mini-\nmum time between contacts. This information is an input to\nthe model.\nThe current performance model has an especially built-in\nheuristic algorithm to emulate the scheduling process. Its\nhigh level structure is shown in figure 2.\nIt is assumed that a sorted list of required contacts is available\nat the start of the algorithm. This list is indexed through k and\nhas the high priority jobs in the first positions. Therefore, if\nthe scheduler tries to iteratively satisfy jobs in a descending\npriority order \(k=k+1 snapshot t the network status must be\ncomputed. This is done by determining the amount of time\nthat all links will be available and multiplying it by their\ncurrent capacities. The result of this computation is a matrix\nDV capturing the data volume that can be returned given\nthe current topology of the network. The link capacity\nused for this computations is not the nominal value but the\nremaining data rate given the connections that are already\nbeing supported. In other words, links that are physically\nviable but cannot support more services because they are\nalready saturated are automatically neglected.\nOnce the network status has been computed, the next step is to\ntry to schedule as many jobs as possible. The algorithm will\nuse a shortest path algorithm to find a viable path between\nthe user being serviced and a ground station of the network.\nIn order to do so, a metric for costing a link Lij must be\nspecified.\nCost\(Lij 0} \(4 result, a telemetry\nservice will always be routed through a set of low data rate\nlinks while a science return service will use a high data rate\ncommunication path. On the other hand, if a link does not\nhave enough capacity to support a contact \(Cost\(Lij Cost\(Lij Heuristic scheduling algorithm\nWith this approach, a service with a viable path from the user\nto a ground station is automatically selected for schedule.\nWhen that happens, three main actions take place:\n Information regarding the instant times during which a\nparticular job has been served gets stored. This information\ncan be later processed to graphically represent the obtained\nschedule for any user of the network.\n• The capacities of the links on the selected path decrease\nby the service data rate. It is assumed that there is no chan-\nnelization of the link bandwidth and therefore the amount of\nretractable data rates is not discretized.\n• Links that were previously viable become unfeasible due\nto beam pointing constraints. These links are only invalidated\nfor the duration of the scheduled contact.\nModeling the network traffic— The current performance\nmodel neglects the burstiness of the traffic that flows through\n9\nthe network. In fact data rates to support a service are always\ncomputed as averages in this model.\nRb =\ndata volume\ncontact time\n\(5 rate \(CBR information.\nA more realistic approach would consider that each service\nhas different traffic characteristics 21] presents a com-\nprehensive study on video, voice, telemetry and command\nservices on past NASA missions Its results indicate that\nthe data rate for supporting these services can in fact be\nmodeled through gamma distributions. A similar conclusion\nis presented in [22] for IP traffic over space networks. It\nalso presents an analytic solution for determining the gain\nof using packet-based architectures that statistically multiplex\nthe incoming traffic.\nIncorporating these result to the performance model will be\ndone in future versions of the tool. They will allow to increase\nthe accuracy of the heuristic scheduler and ensure that link do\nnot get overloaded due to the traffic burstiness. They will also\nallow to numerically assess the differences between packet\nand circuit-switched architectures.\nComputing the architecture benefit—Once the network sched-\nule has been computed, determining the benefit of the archi-\ntecture can be easily done through a two step process.\n• The fraction of successfully scheduled contacts is com-\npared to the expectations of each mission through the require-\nment satisfaction rules. They encode the satisfaction that the\nuser has given the performance of the system. As an example,\nan Earth Observation mission that can only schedule 50 of\nits desired contacts might be completely unsatisfied because\nhalf of the collected data cannot be returned.\n• The satisfaction of all missions are aggregated for the\nobjectives and stakeholders through the value aggregation\nrules. They compute the weighted sum of the user, objective\nand stakeholder satisfaction in 


order to assess the benefit of\nthe whole architecture. The relative importance or weights\nfor the value aggregation rules must be known beforehand\nand are an input to the model.\nCost model\nThe goal of the cost model is to provide an estimate of the\nlifecycle cost of an architecture \(i.e., a set of constellations\nand ground stations particular differ-\nentiating between different contract modalities, \(procurement\nvs hosted payloads vs 100 commercial cost, operations cost, and\nprogram overhead. Some of these are further divided into\nnon-recurring and recurring costs, as illustrated in Fig. 3.\nPayload Cost—Payload cost is only incurred when the con-\ntract modality is procurement or hosted payloads. If a 100%\ncommercial approach is taken, payload cost is set to zero,\nas it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by the\nprovider. Payload cost is the sum of a non-recurring cost\nand a recurring cost. When these values are not provided by\nFigure 3. Lifecycle cost breakdown\nthe user, they are estimated using CERs that utilize payload\nmass m and number of channels n as independent variables.\nThe CERs are taken from the USCM8 model [23] and are\nprovided below.

If a 100% commercial approach\nor hosted payloads approach are taken, bus cost is set to zero,\nas it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by the\nprovider. Bus cost is the sum of a non-recurring cost and a\nrecurring cost. When these values are not provided by the\n10\nuser, they are estimated using CERs that utilize subsystem\nmass as the independent variable. The CERs are taken from\nthe USCM8 model [23] and are provided below. All values\nare in FY2010$k.\nCbus,NR = 110.2mdry \(9 10 is the devel-\nopment cost including the cost of fabricating a qualification\nunit and Cpayl,R is the cost of fabricating the first flight\nunit. The standard error of the estimate \(SEE 114-5127kg is 47%. The SEE of Equation\n10 inside the domain 288-7398kg is 21%. Total cost for\ndevelopment and fabrication of N identical buses is computed\nas illustrated in Equation 8, with a learning factor of 95%.\nNote that the computation of bus cost depends on the dry\nmass of the spacecraft. This can be provided by the user,\nor it can be estimated by the spacecraft design module, which\nis described later in this section.\nLaunch Cost—Launch cost is only incurred when the contract\nmodality is procurement. If a 100% commercial approach\nor hosted payloads approach are taken, launch cost is set to\nzero, as it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by\nthe provider. Launch cost is given by the sum of the costs of\nlaunching all constellations in the architecture. Computation\nof launch cost for a constellation is based on the assumption\nthat, given a constellation of P planes and S satellites per\nplane, P < NL < PS launches are necessary to launch\nthe constellation, i.e., at least one launch per plane \(in\nother words, satellite engines are not sized to do inclination\nchanges after injection by taking into account both\nperformance and geometrical considerations.\nIn particular, a database of launchers is available to each\nconstellation. This database is shown in Table 5. Note that\nthe data concerning performance is provided in terms of the\n3 coefficients of a quadratic function of the orbit altitude.\nIn other words, if the entry of the table for a certain orbit\ntype \(e.g., LEO polar  then the\nperformance at altitude h can be computed as :\nperf\(h 11 computed as follows:\nNL = max{NL,mass, NL,vol, NL,dim} \(12 required\ngiven the total spacecraft mass and the performance of the\nlaunch vehicle to the desired orbit NL,vol is the minimum\nnumber of launches required given the total spacecraft vol-\nume and the volume of the launch vehicle; NL,dim is the\nminimum number of launches required given the sum of the\nmaximum dimension of all spacecraft and the height of the\nlaunch vehicle:\nNL,mass = d\n?NS/C\ni=1 mwet,i\nperf\(lv, orbit 13 14 15 spacecraft in the constella-\ntion, mwet,i, voli, and dmaxi are the wet mass, volume,\nand maximum dimension respectively of spacecraft i, and\nperf\(lv, orbit the volume, and the height respectively of\nthe launch vehicle. Once the number of launches has been\ncomputed launch cost is simply given by the product of\nnumber of launches and launch cost.\nGround segment cost—Ground segment cost is the sum of a\nnon-recurring cost and a recurring cost. When these values\nare not provided by 


the user, they are estimated using CERs\nthat utilize location of the facility, the number of spacecraft,\nand spacecraft lifetime as independent variables. The CERs\nare taken from [23] and are provided below. All values are in\nFY2010$k.\nCground,R = Cground,NR + Cground,Rt\(yr loc n$\nm2\n m2 0.5\n$M\nS/C/yr\nNS/Ct\(yr 16 loc construction cost in different locations, A is\nthe floor area of the facility in m2, and t\(yr lifetime\nin years. The values of the adjustment factor are taken from\n[23].\nService fees— Service fees are only applicable for hosted\npayloads and 100% commercial approaches. In these cases,\nthey can replace payload bus, launch, or ground segment\ncost. Service fees for the hosted payloads approach are\ncomputed as a fix quantity \(10$M resources such as volume, mass, power, data rate, or a\ncombination thereof. Service fees for the 100 commercial\napproach are computed as a fixed quantity \($2k spacecraft design module can be by-\npassed by choosing to assign a commercially available bus\ninstead of designing a bus. While the standard bus approach is\ncloser to reality, the spacecraft design module provides more\ndistinction in lifecycle cost between different architectures,\nand therefore it is chosen as the primary operating mode of\nthe tool. The spacecraft design module is an iterative module\nthat provides a subsystem-level design of the spacecraft bus\nincluding a very rough configuration of the spacecraft from\nthe payload requirements.Assumptions concerning the differ-\nent sub-modules in the spacecraft design module namely the\nbus selection module and the four steps of the process shown\n11\nTable 5.

These values were\nadapted from [25].\nThe ?Vdeorbit is computed assuming that LEO spacecraft are\ndeorbited using atmospheric drag, and all other spacecraft\nare deorbited using solar radiation presure. For drag-based\ndeorbiting

The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators. The mass\nof the sensors is driven by the attitude knowledge accuracy\nrequirement acc \(Equation 26 satisfy by the momentum storage h required \(Equation 27 26 27 that acc can vary depending on the architecture, as the\npointing requirements of a high gain antenna, or an optical\npayload, are very different from those of a low gain antenna.\nConcerning the momentum storage h, it is assumed to be\nsized to counter the different disturbance torques produced by\natmospheric drag, gravity gradient, solar radiation pressure,\nor the Earth’s magnetic field. Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload.

For instance, the mass of the ADCS depends\non the mass of the spacecraft, which obviously depends on the\nmass of the ADCS. Thus, a set of convergence criteria need\nto be defined. The convergence criteria used by the tool are\ndescribed in Equation 31:\n|mdry,i+1 ?mdry,i| < 10kg 31 the current status of the MIT archi-\ntecture study for the SCaN system.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
