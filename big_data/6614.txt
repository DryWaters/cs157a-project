Hybrid Approach for Database Intrusion Detection with Reactive Policies 
204 Database systems are the important assets of the information system infrastructure in most organizations. The databases may contain invaluable sensitive information and unauthorized transaction could cause a lot of harm. In this paper, we proposed a Hybrid Reactive Database Intrusion 
Detection System that detects known as well as new database intrusions. We used an improved Apriori algorithm for mining association rules from the user behaviour. It analyses the associations between various parameters of the user activities This improved Apriori algorithm is considered to make the data mining process faster. Reactive policies are adopted for the detected intrusions. These policies are created based on the severity of an intrusion and an appropriate response is generated for the users who performed intrusive activity. This approach enhances the database security by generating more 
selective and more sensitive rules, and by providing faster decision, faster performance

I NTRODUCTION  Database security has become very essential as there are several ways which can breach the traditional security systems such as firewall. Further the possibility of intrusion from the insider has emerged as large threat. It is very difficult to detect such attacks. In such situation intrusion detection system works fairly well.

Detection system finds the intrusions based on the user activities as explained in [1  Basically, intrusion is an illegal activity performed against the privileges assigned and database is more vulnerable to the intrusions like brute force attack, SQL injection attack, privilege escalation tru sio n  Detection Systems are designed to find out such intrusions They are mainly classified as: anomaly vs misuse detection systems and passive vs reactiv  T h e an o m al y detection system detects the novel attacks whereas the misuse detection system uses the signatures of the known attacks to find out the intrusions. In other category, the passive detection systems simply detects the intrusions and 
send an alert whereas the reactive system  detects as well as reacts to the intrusions to stop them The proposed system is designed to detect such intrusions by using a hybrid detection model that comprises of anomaly as well as misuse detection techniques. It is also designed to react to such intrusions based on the reactive policies [5  T h e p r o cess o f  d e tectio n o f in tru s io n is b a sed  on observation of user activities of a database.

It is only capable of detecting the known attack and this approach produces less false alarms. The system of a s  introduced an approach for DIDS based on anomaly detection based on event sequence clustering. The sequence clustering is only capable of detecting intrusion sequence. It monitors the activity sequence of the users and the change in sequence is predicted as an intrusion.

Data mining 
 S YSTEM A RCHITECTURE  The proposed model consists of the components as shown in the Figure 1. It starts with the database user login. Further the activities of the users are monitored, then the data is pre processed and converted to a suitable format. Improved apriori algorithm is used to filter out rare patterns. The model is accomplished with a response model at the end     Figure 1.  System Architecture for HRDIDS  The model shows the directional flow of the proposed work. It starts with the user login into the database Database is having several users and each user is defined with username and password for authorization. Intrusions start from the login itself e.g. brute force attack. The database is having many user with different privileges assigned to it. Every authorized user should work according to the privileges; if it does any activity which does not come under its privilege will be treated as intrusion Every user which is logging in into database is monitored and its activities are stored in a log file. Every activity in the log file is processed to convert it into a required format This log generates the information of the users\220 activities Operation ID for each operation is defined and log is classified between users with its parameters The preprocessed data is placed in a specific format and the data mining is applied on the preprocessed data set. An improved apriori algorithm is applied as a data mining technique. The algorithm generates the association rules for the given data. These rules are formed on the basis of support and confidence parameter of the apriori output. A threshold is defined which will classify the normal rules and the strong rule. If an association generates support confidence which are above threshold; such rules are classified as strong rule and stored in the rule set  Data mining process generates the rule set and a normal behavior rule set is prepared from the training data set. This normal behavior rule set is used for the anomaly detection model. The new rules generated are compared to the training dataset and if it does not find the match to normal behavior, the rule is considered as the anomaly or intrusion Alongside to the anomaly detection model, we also have a misuse detection model. Misuse detection model have rule set of attack signatures, every time a rule is generated, it is compared to the signature stored in the data set. If it finds the match in data set then it defines it to be intrusion otherwise rule is forwarded to anomaly detection model The anomaly detection works on that and finds out whether it is normal or intrusive log The logs declared to be abnormal or intrusive are attended with the response. A threshold is defined and this will decide reaction to the intrusive user. A severity threshold is decided for each reactive action. Reaction will depend on the severity of intrusion  The important components of the HRDIDS are discussed below

Data Mining is very useful for market-basket applications to analyse the trends of market. Association rule mining is very popular and useful technique in extracting patterns in a large database; it is a very well researched technique. Large datasets are observed which contain items that frequently occur with each other and a threshold level is defined; if the 
The very first step in designing the DIDS is to collect the logs of user activity. The information regarding the user activity should be collected properly and need to be processed properly. Pre-processing of collected logs is done This is done by collecting the user activity in a proper format. This format consists of attributes of a user and its corresponding activity. Each activity is identified by an operation ID and operation status ID 
A distributed Intrusion detection system in n t r odu ced the influence of different data storage modes on detection algorithms. There are a number of approaches available which are specific to Network intrusions that are based on the data mining techniques.Hu Zhen Bing opos ed a  NIDS using known attack signatures. This approach has been utilized for network intrusion detection system not for the DIDS. A pattern based IDS [15 is a NIDS t h at m o n ito r s  packets on the network using sniffers and detects the network intrusions using CIDF \(Common Intrusion Detection Framework\.

It scans the database to verify the support of candidate frequent itemset Misuse and Anomaly detection are the two measure techniques used for IDS. Misuse detection is also known as signature based detection. Misuse detection technique is used for known attacks whereas Anomaly detection is based on finding the unknown attacks. Misuse detection is unable to detect the zero day attack and hence anomaly detection is employed in our system alongside the misuse detection Both techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages: Misuse detection technique has already defined attack patterns so rate of false alarms is less, but it detects only known attacks. On the other hand anomaly detection technique detects novel attacks but the rate of false alarms is high

Apriori algorithm is the best known algorithm for mining association rules in a large database and gets the association rules which are hidden in the database. For generating the association rules Apriori have to scan the database several times to generate the frequent itemsets 
percentage of threshold is crossed for certain association, a strong rule is generated. These rules can be very useful for deciding future trends and in our case; this will give us exact strategy of intruders. One of the very popular techniques in association rule mining is Apriori algorithm. Apriori algorithm gives us the important associations and gives us association patterns that can be very useful for detecting the intrusions We are using data mining technique to find out the associations in a user activity. Each activity is monitored with several attributes and corresponding associations are observed. One of the most popular data mining approaches is to get frequent itemsets from a transaction dataset and derives association rules. Apriori algorithm generates the associations that are hidden in the operations 1

If the support values are larger than the probabilities of support of user sets is considered as frequent itemset

To overcome these drawbacks, we have to reduce the time taken by the Apriori algorithm to generate the frequent itemsets and the candidate itemset. The improved Apriori algorithm os es a m e t h od th at w i ll redu ce t h e number of scan done on the database and consequently reduces the time taken by the Apriori to generate the association rules. This method is based on calculating support values on their probability. Initially support values are obtained using the first scan. Next scans are not done in actual, instead using a probability model, support values are estimated. Likewise we can avoid having large number of scans This process reduces the time taken by the scans and fastens the process. Following steps shows the process  
Apriori is an algorithm for obtaining frequent itemsets using candidate generation [17  Let the set of frequent itemsets of size k be Fk and their candidates be Ck. Apriori scans the database and searches for frequent itemsets of size 1 by accumulating the count for each item. It collects those that satisfy the minimum support requirement. It then iterates on the following three steps and extracts all the frequent itemsets 1. Generate Ck+1, candidates of frequent itemset of size k 1, from the frequent itemset of size k 2. Scan the database and calculate the support of each candidate of frequent itemsets 3. If support of itemsets satis\002es the minimum support requirement, then add them to Fk+1  Finally the candidate frequent itemsets are mined and association rules are produced The above process describes the generalized way used in this improved Apriori algorithm. The process includes calculating the probabilities of support of the frequent itemsets based on the probabilities of 1-itemset

Upon finding the intrusive logs of a user, that user is defined as intruder. Each such user will be entertained with a response policy which is based on the severity of the intrusion. Severity of an intrusion will be defined on the basis of intrusive activity done by the user Response policies are designed to respond to the intrusive behaviour according to its level of intrusion. The response actions are executed by the response system to address the intrusions. The policies will work upon ON {Event} IF Condition} THEN {Action} principle. Depending on the severity of the intrusion following policies are defined   TABLE  I  R ESPONSE POLICIES       The low severity actions may log the anomalous details or send an alert but it will not prevent the intrusion Aggressive actions are applied for high severity actions Such actions are capable of preventing the intrusion proactively by dropping the request, disconnecting the users or denying them from using necessary privileges  IV denotes the number of normal events detected as abnormal

improved Apriori algorithm. A threshold is defined for Support & confidence for each rule, if the rule has parameter values above threshold, then the rule is considered a strong rule. These rules give the normal behaviour of the users  
Test phase is the most important part of IDS. The decision of an audit log being intrusive or normal is taken in test phase. We capture both normal as well as abnormal activities of the users and we test these activities with the normal patterns which we have identified during the training phase     Figure 3. Test Phase  As shown in Figure 3, current data \(audit log\ is matched with trained rule base in case of anomaly detection process If the process uses signature based intrusion detection technique then current data is matched with the updated rule base consisting of all previous intrusive signatures

The database user activities of 5 days are monitored and a rulebase representing the users\220 normal behaviour is generated by applying the improved apriori on the transaction log. The initial support value considered is 10 and confidence as 25  TABLE  II  P RE PROCESSED LOG         The pre-processed log contains the details of all normal transactions. The ResourceID represents the database accessed and OperationID represents operation performed on the database by the user. Every database is assigned a ResourceID, e.g. 30 represents Library database. And operationID 2 represents the \220update\220 operation The normal rulebase represents the rules generated after applying the improved apriori algorithm on the preprocessed log. These rules show the normal behaviour of the users E.g. \217w^31 
in the high severity intrusive activities, we have those abnormal transactions which have crossed the attack frequency of 75%. Here we are not letting the user to continue with the intrusions any more and we are suspending that user. The user will not be able to perform any kind of operation on the database .The user can get back the access of the database only if the administrator change the status of the suspended user to a active user 
For every abnormal event a reactive policy is applied We ignored initial 25% attempts of the intrusive users by simply logging the transaction just to reduce the number of false alarms. Next 25% attempts were noticed by sending the alert messages about the intrusive activity. If the frequency of the intrusion exceeds the threshold 50%, it comes under moderate severity activities and if we found any intrusion with this range, we are aborting the transaction there itself Existing

 So we have two rulebases: normal which represents normal user\220s pattern and misuse which contains the patterns of the abnormal behaviour. Table III shows few of the generated patterns through the abnormal events. The rules represent the abnormal behaviour of the users  The current transactions are tested against these two rule sets. The current activity is first matched with the misuse rulebase to check whether it is matching with the known abnormal condition. If it is not a known intrusion, then it is matched with the normal pattern to check whether it represents a normal activity. If not, then it is a novel attack and it\220s pattern is updated in misuse rulebase 98.50 99

processing. We call these file data sources and table data sources respectively. Our data sources pane has functionalities to create either table or file data sources by uploading a chosen CSV file, as shown in Figure 11   Figure 12. View Creation Fu nctionality \(left\ in operation \(right  3  Data Source Attachment Each data attach-point has a specific minimum schema  expectation to be able to make use of the data source attached. The minimum schema expectation makes some attributes mandatory. For example, a demographic data source is required to have a CustomerID attribute that uniquely identifies each customer.  It may have any number of additional attributes; for example, in the unsupervised segmentation workflow, any additional attribute of a customer is used by the clustering algorithm to measure the similarity between customers. Often, the minimum schema attribute names may not exactly match the customers attribute names. For example, the customer may use CustID to uniquely identify a customer whereas the attach-point may be expecting CustomerID. We have incorporated a view creation facility that helps the customer to create a non-materialized view by mapping the attributes in her data source to those expected by the minimum schema. Once such a view is created, it appears as another data source, and can be chosen from the drop down list of data sources. Figure 12 shows how view creation functionality gives the user the option to pick an attribute from her source to the minimum schema attribute, in this case ID, CUSTID, TRANSACTIONDATE, and TOTALPRICE 4  Downloading Results We implemented the workflow execution as an asynchronous operation, where the user finishes the setup uploading data, attaching data sources, choosing the workflow to be executed\d clicks on submit. When the results are ready, the web application alerts the user and provides a link to download the results file V  R ELATED W ORK  Literature related to our work may be broadly classified under three heads: \(1\loud Computing for Services, \(2 Analytics Services, and \(3\orkflows for Analytics  Cloud Computing for Services Cloud computing is the umbrella term used to denote the delivery of computing as a service rather than as a product. Cloud computing provides shared resources, software and information to computing devices as a utility over the network. It has become widely popular over the last few years and has been assessed to be no less influential than any of the previous trendsetting technologies [13   T h o ugh m a n y o b s ta c l e s to the u s a g e o f  cloud computing have been identified in e s a me report emphasizes that the utility of cloud computing is likely to outweigh its disadvantages. Cloud computing provides many advantages such as elasticity and transference of over-provisioning and under-provisioning risks. Forecas u g g e s t th at clou d co m p u t i n g  w oul d  grow at a very fast rate over the next few years.  Cloud computing has been used for a variety of tasks such as parallel data mining d g raph an al y tic s 16   Analytics Services Though popular analytics engines such as SAS, SPSS and R started off as stand-alone applications that need to be installed on a server to be used, recent trends suggest that commercial analytics engines are not far off from delivering full-fledged analytics capabilities on the cloud. Predixion Software 13 and Zementis 14 offer scoring of any PMML 15 model over the cloud, whereas SAS has started to offer many of their functionalities over the cloud  How ev er, to th e bes t of ou r k n o w l edg e, th ere h a s been  a very limited work on providing powerful analytics functionalities over the cloud that can readily be used without requiring considerable expertise in analytics and the specific tool to be used  Workflows for Analytics The main novelty of the solution proposed in this paper rests in the usage of configurable and extensible multi-workflows to make it easy to use analytics despite limited technical know-how. Analytics workflows themselves are not novel and are the primary means of using SPSS \(with the SPSS Modeler component\wever, a typical SPSS workflow is designed to be used by personnel who understand the semantics of typical data mining operations. In particular, SPSS provides a fleet of functionality that is powerful enough to be used across domains, and is not specific to the scenario in which it may be deployed. For example, the semantics of the CustID field is unknown to a generic clustering operator, and under a default setting, the clustering operator would use the CustID field also for clustering leading to the undesirable results of    13  http://www.predixionsoftware.com/predixion  14  http://www.zementis.com  15  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language

grouping customers with numerically close CustIDs together. We eliminate the need to explicitly specify the exclusion of such attributes, by folding in the semantics of attributes such as CustID \(among others\to the prepackaged workflows. In a pre-packaged workflow for customer segmentation, the fact that CustID needs to be excluded in clustering would already be already preconfigured. The customer can thereby focus on configuring other parameters that are likely to affect business such as number of clusters in the outp ut or the rules to use in designating customers as high-value or low-value. The concept of multi-flows, where a single template workflow can instantiate many possible workflows, has not been developed in prior literature to the best of our knowledge VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Analytics, despite its apparent utility in improving business has not been adopted widely. The main deterrents include the large upfront cost of procuring computing infrastructure and the cost of setting up an in-house analytics team of statisticians and business analysts. Such costs are so high that many small and medium businesses cannot afford traditional analytics solutions, especially in the developing regions of the world due to a spectrum of other deterrent factors that we have outlined. Many such deterrents may be effectively eliminated by the delivery of analytics services on the cloud. In this paper, we propose configurable pre-packaged multi-flows flows that span multiple workflows\ to deliver analytics services on the cloud towards helping to improve analytics penetration Multi-flows bundle together related workflows enabling users to explore and exploit related functionality by making minor configuration changes. We illustrate how changes to workflow configurations may be made easily without any in-depth knowledge of the various operators involved. Our multi-flows are easily extensible to non-disruptively include new functionalities in response to the changing needs of a customer \(or a changing customer base We described a survey of Indian retail players that helped us identify \(and validate our assumptions of\e primary obstacles to analytics penetration in the sector; we also analyzed the major analytics needs of such businesses. We illustrated that many such common analytics needs may be effectively captured within a small number of workflows We developed a fully-functional system that implements the chosen multi-flows for the retail sector. We detailed the various features of the system, the multi-ness of the flows in the system, and example configuration settings that can be used to fine tune specific multi-flows. Through generous usage of screenshots, we illustrated the ease of use of our system; we expect that such enhanced convenience of usage will aid penetration of analytics into new customer bases  Future Work We are exploring further enhancements to improve ease of use of analytics solutions on the cloud including an automatic mapping of attributes in data sources to attach-points by exploiting the data type and distribution Also, making analytics widespread would necessarily involve addressing some of the problems that are applicable to cloud computing in general. These include concerns about data privacy in the cloud and the loss of control of the computation elopin g techn iqu es  to eff ecti v el y an d  provably anonymize of data without affecting the results of specific operators such as clustering or classification is an interesting direction to pursue A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Abhishek Subramanian, Neethu Suresh Shubhendu Aggarwal and Varun Srivastava for efforts in implementing the system and performing market surveys VII  R EFERENCES  1  Todd Morrison, Retail chain uses in-house analytics team to run SAP BusinessObjects, TechTarget Search SAP, 4 th March, 2011 http://searchsap.techtarget.com/news/2240033086/Retail-chain-uses-in-houseanalytics-team-to-run-SAP-BusinessObjects  2  Rakesh Agrawal, and Ramakrishnan Srikant, Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases,  VLDB 1994, Chile 3  How to structure a business analytics team http://mybusinessanalytics.blogspot.in/2011/09/business-analytics-teamstructure.html Retrived March 2, 2012 4  MA Rappa, The utility business model and the future of computing services IBM Systems Journal, 43\(1\ 2004 5  Brian Hayes, Cloud Computing, Comm.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
