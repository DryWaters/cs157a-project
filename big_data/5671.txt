Due to a lack of resources and accurate assessment tools, it remains a challenge for many instructors to identify students errors during their English reading process. In order to co pe with this problem, this paper applies a data mining technique to identify the studentsê error patterns. From the database of students errors, studentsê error patterns and their association rules were discovered through generalized association rules By using the techniques proposed in this paper, instructors will be able to acquire important and useful information about studentsê English reading comprehension pr oblems in a more efficient way Keywords Data mining; Generalized association rules, Cumulative sentence analysis \(CSA glish reading comprehension Engineering students  1  Introduction 1.1  Background For engineering students, English reading comprehension ability is crucial in academic settings and their future career. In order to absorb fundamental knowledge in textbooks and deepen prof essional knowledge in their workplace, it is essential for engineering students to read in English fluently. Several researchers have emphasized the importance of English in engineering education   2   F o r  example, it was pointed out th at English is the major international language of sci ence community which enables the students to acquire professi onal knowledge through reading texts in English [1   Som e authors also stresse d t h at engineering students should be equipped with specific English skills which will become valuab le resources in their   However, there are still a considerable number of engineering students struggling wi th reading in English in Taiwan. Some authors have attributed engineering students reading difficulty to vocabulary knowledge and proposed lexical instruction [4 5 In L2 research, Al d e rson states that the knowledge of syntac tic structure plays a significant role in second language reading  S h iot s u a n d W e ir a l so demonstrated the relative contribu tion of syntactic knowledge to L2 reading comprehension performa Hence if teachers can identify studentsê sentence analysis problems, it would be easier to help students to cope with their reading comprehension difficulty. Nevertheless, the evaluation of studentsê syntactic knowledge during reading process remains a challenge in classrooms due to a lack of resources time or assessment tools  In order to enhance studentsê reading comprehension ability, numerous e-learning systems have been developed Recently more and more researchers are aware of the potential of data mining techni que in e-learning.

  identifying studentsê different levels of vocabulary, grammar and reading abilit  1.2   Purpose of the study  The results of previous studies indicate that the data mining technique is an attractive approach to provide a solution for iden tifying engineering st udentsê reading comprehension di fficulties. Hence, this paper presents a Cumulative Sentence Analysis \(CSA\-learning system in which each studentês correct reactions and errors during their reading process can be recorded [14 n t h e paper adopts a core data mining technique, association rule to identify the patterns of stude ntsê reading comprehension errors. The system developm ent and data mining processes are described below 2  CSA reading approach   In the framework of CSA, reading comprehension is regarded as a problem, which belongs to a hierarchy of units and sections. The resolution to each problem, i.e. the comprehension of a sentence consists of six steps. For example, the analysis of the example sentence C++ comes with libraries of predefined functions that you can use in your programs can be described in the following steps   Step 1. Id entify finite verbs A finite verb is a verb base form which may be combined with Ös for 3 rd person or past tense form. In the example sentence the finite verbs are comes and use   Step 2. Find key words Key words mean conjunctions or relative pronouns that sepa rate dependent and independent clauses. In the example sentence the key word is that   Step 3. Separate clauses In this step, the goal is to identify each clause in the sentence. There are two clauses in the example sentence      Step 4. Identify the s ubject and main verb pairs  This step is to find out the subject and main verb for each clause In the example sentence, the subject and main verb pairs are  C++ comes and you can use   Step 5. Add words stepwise The analysis in this step can be illustrated as follows, where newly-added words are in bold typeface   Clause 1: C++ comes with libraries of predefined functions Clause 2: that\(=functions can use in your programs  Analysis Clause 1: C++ comes with libraries of predefined functions S+V C++ comes  E: C++ comes with libraries  E: C++ comes with libraries of predefined functions  Clause 2: that\(=functions can use in your programs  S+V you can use  E that\(=functions you can use E: that\(=functions\ou can use in your programs   Step 6 Translate the sentence into Chinese. The translation of the example sentence is èC   In the CSA system, students only need to click buttons to process each step except step 6. The clicked words will turn into different colors. Students can check the correct answers provided in the system. The reading materials were adapted from çAbsolute C  h e stude nts ha ve received explicit CSA on-line reading instruction   3. Experimental design   A total of 184 freshmen of information engineering department at a university in southern Taiwan were selected as the experimental sample. These students had studies English for at least 6 years since junior high school. The age of the students ranged from 18 to 20. The CSA on-line English instruction lasted for 12 weeks, 2 hours a week. After 12 weeks of instruction, an assessment was administered to register the studentsê responses during their reading process Figure 1 presents the flow chart of the research method  The material for the assessmen t was compiled from 7 general sentence patterns identified in the course textbooks 1\ple sentences; \(2\om pound sentences; \(3\plex sentences; \(4\pound-complex sentences, \(5\entences with relative clause modifying subject, \(6\sentences with relative clause modifying object and \(7\a dependent clause serving as a noun. A pool of 109 sentences was constructed for the assessment, from which the system randomly selected 3 sentences for each pattern of sentence      69 Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Guilin, 10-13 July, 2011 


    Therefore the students were required to answer 21 multiple-choice questions by using CSA approach. From reviewing the errors produced by the students in the previous semester, frequent error types were found in each step. These frequent error types were ran domly selected as distracters in each item. For each item, the students had to choose one correct answer among 4 or 5 choi ces. Table 1 shows the error type-item mapping     4.  Analysis and results The major purpose of this paper is to find out the error patterns of reading comprehension among the subjects, i.e the frequency of error occurrence at each step in CSA and possible associations among the error patterns. These combinations can be identified through association rule mining. From the frequent ite m set of the database, further combinations of association rules can be identified. In this study, Generalized Association Ru was use d to m i ne the data in order to obtain th e confidence for the rules at different levels. In brief, an association rule can be expressed in the followi ng construct  IF error pattern X  THEN error pattern Y  confidence value = Z  The expression means whenever an item set contains X then the item set probably contains Y also. The rule confidence is defined as the percentage of items containing Y in addition to X with regard to the overall number of items containing X. Formula for calc ulating the confidence values is shown in formula \(1    1  100  item X rrence for Total occu d Y item X an rrence for Total occu confidence       To achieve the purpose of this study, this study used a free software, WEKA, which is developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. WEKA was selected as the mining tool, because it of fers functions to implement algorithms for classification, clustering, and associ ation rule mining, as well Table 1.

  as graphical user interfaces and visualization  For exploratory purpose, the mining of association rules was executed until level 4. Table 2 depicts the results of large itemsets of each step of CSA at level 1. Minimum metric of confidence was set at 50%. The number of cycles performed was 90 Table 2. Large itemsets at level 1  Occurrences Step 1 844 Step 2 783 Step 3 1452 Step 4 1271 Step 5 1551 Step 6 1811  The results indicated that the students made most errors in step 6, which is to select a Chinese transl ation of the target sentence, followed by step 5, adding words to each clause step by step. Both steps were considered most confusing for the learners of this study. Ta ble 3 shows the top 10 rule structures with the highest confidence  As indicated in Table 3, rule 1 has the highest confidence \(78 students produce errors in step 1, 4 and 5 they will have the highest probability to make mistakes in step 6. Errors in step 1 had the highest confidence to induce errors in other steps, such as in rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 10. It implies that if the stude nts produce erro rs in step 1 identifying the finite verb, then they most likely to produce errors in other step as well. However, error production is not sequential, i.e. errors in one step wonêt possibly induce errors in the subsequen t step. Furthermore, the order of the steps might be reversed. For example, in rule 8, error produced in step 2, 4 and 6 may lead to error production in step 3. The relationship between the steps was not as close as expected. It was predicted that if step 3 is wrong, then step 5 would be wrong as well, because if the student can not separate the boundary of clauses correctly in step 3, he might make the same mistake in step 5, which requires adding words in each clause of the sentence. Nevertheless, the confidence of the rule If step 3, then step 5 was not higher than 50 Upon the observation of the data collected, several findings can be induced as follows  1  If a student can not identify the finite verb, the subject and add words to correct position in each clause, then he would not understand the sentence correctly  2  If a student can no t identify the finite verb, and the key words, then he would not understand the sentence correctly 3  If a student can not separate the clauses correctly identify the subj ect and verb, and add word in correct position, then he would not understand the sentence correctly 4  If a student can no t identify the finite verb, separate the clauses, and adding words to each clause correctly, then he would not understand the sentence correctly  5  If a student can not id entify the finite verb, and the subject, he would not understand the sentence correctly 5.  Conclusions The major goal of this study was to identify error patterns of engineering students in reading English textbooks through data mining. This study proposes a new approach to use data mining to identify error patterns produced by engineering students during En glish reading process. We have successfully used generalized association rules to mine possible rules of association am ong studentsê errors produced at each step of CSA. The results indicate that it is convincing to use data mining to discover error patterns during students reading comprehension process, which therefore ensures the applicability of data mining in English reading instruction Traditional assessment of read ing compreh ension often utilizes tests in pencil-paper ve rsion, which only provides Table 3.

  information about students learning outcome. In the CSA system proposed in this study we can not only register every mistake made by the students during each step of sentence analysis, but also find out the combination of their error patterns through data mining, which offers more useful information for English reading instruction  Suggestions for future research include further development of the CSA system to allow users to take advantage of personalized feedback of their error patterns, as well as a recommendation system which provides exercises of each step in CSA. These im plementations should facilitate engineering studentsê ability to read materials of their professional field written in English. Furthermore, the system may also be applied to other e-learning courses, such as remedial reading courses or continuing education  Acknowledgements This paper is supported by the National Science Council Taiwan under contract numbers NSC 99-2410H-214-024  References 1  M.

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
