methods in the intelligent vehicle navigation. The information from the different sensors of vehicle GPS and DR integrated navigation system needs to be fused in order to implement the optimal evaluation of global states, because of the different measurements and their noise characteristics. Th e federal Kalman filter is designed to fuse GPS and DR information. Two local filters process GPS and DR data respectively, and the main filter is responsible for data fusion and reset to the local filters. The information fusion based on federal filter solves some key problems such as system unavailability, big accumulati ve errors with GPS or 
DR alone, and it makes the system’s global evaluation optimal. The simulation results show that the positioning accuracy and the credibility of the vehicle integrated navigation are much higher than that when GPS or DR is used alone Key words Information optimization, Fusion, Federal filter, Credibility, Positioning accuracy   1. Introduction  Researchers have attached more and more importance to the Intelligent Transportation System ITS\, of which many advanced sensor techniques 
electronics, information and system engineering are integrated 1 The real-time, high precision positioning of vehicles is an important branch of ITS. Global Positioning System \(GPS\applied widely because it can provide navigation and timing information quickly in all weather. However, GPS signals usually interrupt when the vehicles are sheltered from buildings bridges, channels, etc, and it results to navigation information unavailability. On the other hand, Dead 
Reckoning \(DR\ is an another widely used positioning technique because of its low cost, however, it cannot be used solely for long time due to its big accumulative errors 2 Currently, the integrated system combining GPS sensor with DR sensor is employed in the vehicle navigation. Consequently, the problems such as system unavailability, big accumulative errors with GPS alone or DR alone can be solved effectively. In addition, the vehicle positioning accuracy is improved greatly The information from GPS and DR sensors needs 
to be fused, because the measurements and noise characteristics of GPS and DR system are significantly different. Generally, there are two main fusion methods including the centralized fusion and the distributed fusion 3 In the centralized fusion, all sensor measurement information is transmitted to the data center to be processed and fused 4 Apparently, the outcome of fusion center is optimal because the original measuring data used by fusion center have no 
information loss. But its requirements for system bandwidth and computation speed are rather high, so it is difficult to be implemented in engineering. On the contrary, the federal filter presented by Carlson is a distributed filter. It can fuse multiple sensors information to gain the optimal global state evaluation 5 of which the variance up-limit technique and the uniform information distribution rule are adopted. Compared with the centralized fusion, the federal filter has many advantages such as its higher 
credibility, more convenient information distribution and quicker computation 6  In this paper, the information of GPS and DR is updated respectively on the basis of uniform state variables, and is fused by the federal filter. The positioning accuracy and credibility of the vehicle navigation system are improved greatly

2. Structure of inte grated navigation  2.1. System organization  Vehicle GPS/DR integrated navigation system is composed of a GPS system and a DR system. The system organization is given in Fig.1. It shows that the GPS system is composed of all-direction antenna satellite receiver, interface circuits, filter, and the DR system is composed of rate gyro, odometer, interface circuits and filter  Fig.1 Organization of vehicle GPS/DR integrated navigation system   2.2. Structure of federal filter  Both of the GPS and DR systems have a measuring system independently and capture their respective information. A two-level federal filter is designed to fuse the GPS and DR information, in which the main filter combines GPS and DR local filters. According to the information distribution principle, the federal filter can make the multi-sensor information fused optimally, and the system credibility is better. Ref. [7 demonstrated the fact that the global state evaluation by the federal filtering is as optimal as by the centralized filtering. The information fusion process of the federal filter used by GPS/DR integrated navigation is shown in Fig.2  Fig.2  Federal filtering structure   Where     i k k X      m k k X are the state valuation values of local filters and main filter respectively    i k k P     m k k P are the covariance matrixes of local filters and main filter respectively i  represents information distribution coefficient 2  1  i and 1 2 1       3.

Information fusion  The vehicle’s position evaluation data of the GPS local system and the DR local system are transmitted into the main filter, where they are to be fused Design the main filter, of which its information distribution coefficient is 0  m  namely 0   1      m k k P The main filter itself has no distributed information and no filtering calculation, however, it only fuses the local filters’ data. The process of information fusion is given as follows  4.1.

Simulation and analysis  In order to justify the information fusion algorithm based on federal Kalman filter in vehicle navigation the semi-physical simulation is designed and performed on the computer with Matlab software Suppose the initial velocity of vehicle is 10m/s, and 0  1    0    The initial value of system global state variable is  T 0 1 0 0 0 10 10 0 0   X  The sample interval is 1s and the simulation time is 500s. Other parameters are shown in Tab. 1  Tab.1  Parameter Settings  e   n   e   n      e q  n q   q  s q  1Hz 0.1m/s 2 0.1 Hz 20m 0.1 0 s 0.5m  GPS and DR positioning data are captured from a moving vehicle. Assume the detection probability and false probability of GPS receiver are 0.94 and 0.05 respectively, and its state is u1 The detection probability and false probability of DR system are 0.95 and 0.02 respectively, and its state is u2 The main filter selects the optimal fusion rule based on minimum false probability. The detection performance comparison with different poisoning methods is shown in Tab.2  Tab.2  System Detection Performance Comparison  Both DR GPS and abnormal GPS positioning alone DR positioning alone GPS/DR integrated positioning Detection probability 0.0010 0.0570 0.0470 0.8930 False probability 0.9310 0.0196 0.0196 0.0030 It shows from Tab.2 that the detection performance of integrated positioning system is the best when both GPS and DR work normally, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis above  In our simulations, the vehicle position is evaluated using GPS filtering alone and GPS/DR fusion filtering respectively, in order to justify the information fusion The variances of positioning error calculated by the two filtering methods are given in Tab.3.

 Fig. 6  North error with GPS/DR integrated filtering   From Tab.3, it is known that the positioning error of GPS/DR integrated filtering is reduced by approximate 150% to 180%, compared with GPS filtering alone, so the vehicle positioning accuracy is improved greatly. By further analysis, it is easy to find the following reasons: the main filter provides feedbacks to reset GPS and DR local filters, so the evaluation accuracy of GPS filter and DR filter is improved respectively, and in return, it makes the global state evaluation of the main filter optimal and the vehicle positioning accuracy improved From Fig. 3-4, it is easily known that the positioning error near 320s of GPS filtering alone changes greatly. It might have been caused by GPS signal interrupting, so the GPS/DR integrated filtering can avoid effectively the system unlock issue with a GPS alone system, which improves system credibility From the above analysis, we can conclude that the vehicle’s position evaluation based on GPS and DR information fusion has some advantages over the system with GPS or DR filtering alone  6. Conclusion  In summary, combining the GPS system with the low cost DR system, a vehicle integrated navigation system can avoid the system unlock caused by signal interrupt with GPS alone and big accumulated errors caused by gyro drift with DR alone. The federal Kalman filter is employed to fuse GPS and DR information, which makes the system’s global performance optimal. We design and implement the vehicle’s position evaluation based on GPS and DR information fusion, and it has the following advantages GPS system and DR system work independently When GPS or DR system breaks down, the brokendown system can be isolated from the main system The evaluation of main filter can be calculated by the other filter so that the main system continues to work normally  Because the main filter can provide feedbacks to reset the local filters, the evaluation accuracy of GPS filter and DR filter is improved respectively. In return it makes the global state evaluation of the main filter optimal GPS filter and DR filter calculating in parallel makes the system gain better real-time processing capability  References  1  Bishop R,  “A survey of intelligent vehicle application worldwide Proceedings of the IEEE intelligent vehicles symposium May 2000, pp.25-30 2  Zheng Chuanbiu, Tian Weifeng, Jin Zhihua, “Application of unscented Kalman filter in state estimation for land vehicle navigation system Journal of system simulation  vol. 17, no. 6, Jun 2005,pp. 1456-1458 3  Gharavi H, Ban K, “Multi hop sensor network design for wide band communications Proceedings of the IEEE August  2003, pp. 1221-1234 4  A.

 and start developing integrated systems again, or finding a method of migrating to a new generation of systems, which would support integration. Due to the rich source of information contained in them and to make development more manageable, the second option was chosen. Hence, in 2004 LGA_A started examining available solutions to meet the challenge for developing a standardised, flexible, integrated and homogeneous IT infrastructure. After reviewing these solutions, LGA_A took the decision to introduce ERP systems to solve their integration problems and provide better services. Also, LGA_A was aiming at integrating its business processes through an ERP solution. However, soon LGA_A realised that ERP systems cannot communicate with other packaged systems and have limitations, as they cannot exchange information with other vendor applications The insufficient nature of their IT infrastructure and the need for integration led LGA_A to revisit their strategies for developing integrated IT infrastructure. Thus, the top management formed an ambitious vision aiming at: \(a\abling integration internally and externally; \(b\ieving effective and efficient joined up government and \(c\abling electronic request and delivery of services. As a result, supporting the decision making process for EAI adoption. LGA_A did not take the decision to fully integrate the borough since such a solution had a high cost. SDE reported that the plan for developing an integrated IT infrastructure on a large scale was considered of high risk as there is no single integration technology or software package that supports the development of an integrated IT infrastructure and there is a lack of knowledge in LGA_A regarding on EAI solutions. This indicates that barriers like the lack of knowledge on EAI and the lack of a single EAI product that solves all integration problems, influenced their decisions As the plans for integrating LGA_A were not completely justified, its top management suggested a pilot to be run and evaluate its outcome. The pilot demonstrates that the integration is technically feasible, can deliver significant benefits to LGA_A and may assist in extracting relevant EAI barriers and risks. Such a decision is supported by the literature  G A _ A  h oped th at t h en central g o v e rnm ent would recognise the success and importance of the project and award it National Project status. As the decision was taken to adopt EAI solution for the pilot project and for other projects in future, the interviewees was asked to comment on whether what factors negatively and positively affected the EAI adoption process. HIT and SDM replied that   most vital negative factor was the silo mentality among our older staff members that resisted to such a change in the department this was also because there were insufficient technical skills and expertise to do integration and our staff lacked understanding of business integration for this reason we had to invest money to train our staff to build integration skills   The HIT also reported on positive factors   despite there were some problems but when systems integrated through EAI, the systems physically got better and everybody saw that the working conditions and our resources are improving i.e. performance as well as the systems improved. As a consequence of doing this the moral of the staff improved and communication and information sharing was enhanced   In the next section, the authors present the testing of research issues and highlighting the empirical results  4.1.

  4.2. Testing Research Issue 2 Adoption Lifecycle Phases  The interviewees were asked to comment and illustrate the importance of the aforesaid adoption lifecycle phases based on the EAI project. Initially all the interviewees agreed that these phases are very important. For example SDE reported that  yes these phases are very important with a perfect breakdown and we faced these phases in EAI project   Whereas, HIT reported that  proposal and adoption decision phases are vital and are the physical aspects whereas motivation and conception are not inevitably physical aspects unless you got a fairly refined strategic approach to what you want to do   SDM stated that before the motivation phase they also faced external driver phase in the project LGA_A was driven by some external influences e.g pressure from central government to improve their service delivery. Due to such influences, LGA_A was motivated to run a pilot project. In addition, the senior development support engineer and the HIT stated that they faced another phase before the proposal phase such as the discussion phase and the research phase respectively. After discussing on these phases with the interviewees, it appears that both have the same underlying meaning i.e  before adoption decision phase we may have research phase by research this we mean that we do some sort of discussions to run a pilot case study and this could be before the proposal phase. The reason to bring this phase before proposal is that if we need resources that actually enable us to do the pilot study, then we might need to take the decision to get the money to do it   After analysing all the interviews, the authors noted that external driver phase can be same as motivation phase. The reason is that an organisation may be motivated to take a step when it is either influenced internally due to some problem or externally through some stakeholders influence Whereas, the discussion or research phase may also be the same as proposal phase. The rationale is that in proposal phase e.g. the departments making decisions to adopt technology need to some sort of research and provide substantiated reasons for approval from the organisation based on the research, besides this the departments need to analyse their requirements and assess their capabilities for acquiring a technology Thus, the interviewees were asked to illustrate the importance of the adoption lifecycle phases. The importance of each phase is presented in Table 2  Table 2: Importance of Adoption Lifecycle Phases  Adoption Lifecycle Phases HIT SDE SDM Motivation  Conception  Proposal    Adoption Decision   4.3. Testing Research Issue 3 Mapping EAI adoption factors on adoption lifecycle phases  Before commencing on the mapping of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases, the interviewees were explained how to perform the mapping Thereafter, the interviewees were asked to map the factors influencing EAI adoption on different phases of the adoption lifecycle. The interviewees went through a rigorous thinking process and mapped the factors \(based on its influence\ each phase of the adoption lifecycle. Table 3 illustrates the results of the mapping of factors for motivation phase only The factors with less \(i.e. one interviewee supporting and other two not\ and no \(i.e. none of the interviewees supporting\ support are discarded. The reason is that these factors had less influence or did not influence on a specific phase. On the other hand factors with full \(i.e. all three interviewees supporting\ and moderate \(i.e. two interviewees supporting and third not supporting\ support are utilised for further empirical research  Table 3: Summarising the Factors with Full or Moderate Support on the Motivation Phase  Motivation Phase  Factors HIT SDE SDM PF Project Champion    Citizen s Satisfaction    Critical Mass    TF IT Sophistication    Data Security and Privacy    SP Top Management Support    Higher Administrative Authority    FF Return on Investment    OF Benefits    Size    Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 4.4. Testing Research Issue 4 Prioritising the importance of EAI adoption factors on the adoption lifecycle phases  Table 1 validates the factors using Miles and Huberman w h erea s, T a ble 3 illustrates th e  mapping of factors on the motivation phase of the adoption lifecycle. However, these tables do not illustrate the important of each factor on the adoption lifecycle phases. This section introduces AHP technique to prioritise the importance of factor influencing EAI adoption. Table 4 illustrates the global weights-based prioritisation of factors for example on only motivation phase \(due to the constraints on length of the paper, the authors did not include the prioritisation results of other three adoption lifecycle phases\ These weights are obtained by using the Expert Choice \(EC\ software and the conclusions drawn from them are the final results of the analysis of collective judgements provided by the panel of interviewees selected for LGA_A. The results presented in these tables do not mean that any factor is unimportant. It merely exhibits interviewees perceptions on the importance of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases  Table 4: Prioritising the Importance of Factors on the Motivation Phase  Prioritising Factors on the Motivation Phase Factor Categories Factors Prioritisation Result TF IT Sophistication 1\ 0.5963 SF Top Management Support 1\ 0.5963 PF Project Champion 2\ 0.5146 OF Benefits 3\ 0.4583 PF Citizen s Satisfaction 4\ 0.3568 OF Size 5\ 0.2083 PF Critical Mass 6\ 0.1293 TF Data Security and Privacy 7\ 0.0704 SF Higher Administrative Authority 7\ 0.0704 FF Return on Investment 8\ 0.0000  5. Discussions and Revision of the Model  According to the empirical findings, only two factors were not validated i.e. formalisation and evaluation framework. The reasons are: \(a\GA_A did not follow any formal procedure to assess EAI technological solution and \(b\ no evaluation framework was used to assess EAI technological solution but relied on the software vendor. Other factors have either directly or indirectly influenced the decision making process for EAI technological solution adoption. On the other hand, six new factors were identified such as \(a data consistence and project delivery timescale as internal pressure factors b stakeholder s pressure and competition as external pressure factors, \(c stakeholder s support as a support factors, and \(d central government grants  as a financial factor. Four new adoption lifecycle phases were also identified from the empirical findings from LGA_A: [\(a external driver and/or \(b driving force c discussion and/or \(d research phase  tern al driv e r or d r iv ing  f o rce ph a s e are prior to the motivation phase, discussion and or research phases are prior to the proposal phase whereas, adoption decision phase was also reported with a different term i.e investment phase. The findings illustrate that the role of factors, adoption lifecycle phases, mapping of factors and prioritising the importance EAI adoption factors on the adoption lifecycle phases had high importance during EAI adoption process in LGA_A Thus, the authors propose that while exploring EAI adoption in LGAs a\actors, \(b\ lifecycle phases, \(c\mapping of factors and \(d\oritising the importance of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases provides a deeper understanding of interrelationships within LGAs. In doing so, the revised proposed EAI adoption model may: \(a\ercome IT infrastructure limitations within LGAs, \(b\mprove the level of analysis and \(c\upport LGAs when adopting EAI  6. Conclusions  LGAs are complex organisations and are managed by the consent and rules set by the central government. They are influenced by other government authorities and ministries, and their IS adoption involve distributed decision-making based on a division of control and powers [17, 39   Conversely, private organisations have direct and undivided power over decisions and flexible management style with inter-departmental teams working in central coordination T h is  distinction illustrates that LGAs have a bureaucratic nature and are committed to outdated cultural values Such characteristics emphasize risk aversion and insist that structures enhance control rather than connected thinking with silos in LGAs, let alone between them reov er, each L G A dis p la y s  differences in the way: \(a\eir business processes are implemented to provide citizen services, and \(b makes its decisions that differs a lot from other private organisations h es e th eoris e d conceptions distinguish LGAs from other sectors EAI represents an attractive proposition to LGAs, since EAI offers the opportunity to leverage the systems into a seamless chain of processes and present a unified view of their information [12, 28  When such leveraging and presentation occurs, LGAs Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


  may capitalise on their opportunities offered by LGA initiatives \(e.g. e-Government\se then they may efficiently interact with their citizens and other stakeholders on a consistent basis w e v e r EAI is an emerging area within LGAs, thus, there remains an absence of theoretical models, which means there is still a case for the identification of factors that affect the decision making process for EAI adoption and identification of adoption lifecycle phases, with the development of empirically validated underpinnings argued, justified and presented in this paper. The authors sought to address the established voids by proposing a novel conceptual model for EAI adoption in LGAs. The model takes into consideration the parame ters that were identified in the normative literature as influencing factors and adoption lifecycle phases. The proposed conceptual model is novel as it includes: \(a\e model consists of a set of factors influencing EAI adoption in LGA_A and incorporates factors identified separately in previous studies. These factors are used for the developing an EAI adoption model in LGAs, \(b\e model incorporates adoption lifecycle phases Empirical findings illustrate that LGA_A passed through these phases while adopting EAI, \(c\e model assimilates the mapping of factors influencing EAI adoption in LGA_A on the adoption lifecycle phases, and \(d\e model incorporates the prioritisation \(importance\ EAI adoption factors in LGA_A on the adoption lifecycle phases The model can be used as a tool for decisionmaking to support LGAs and allow decision makers and researchers to understand and analyse EAI adoption. The concepts of the proposed model can be used for the adoption of inter-organisational IS since such systems should focus on integrated technologies and infrastructures. An interpretive, qualitative case study approach was selected to conduct this research It is not the intention of this paper to offer prescriptive guidelines to EAI adoption but rather describe case study perspectives that allow other researchers to relate their experiences to those reported. Hence, offering a broader understanding of the phenomenon of EAI adoption in LGAs Therefore, the lessons learnt are a result of the description provided and do not seek to be prescriptive. These lessons are summarised below Lesson 1 The practical implications of the mapping of factors on adoption lifecycle phases are  this process can support in better understanding the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs. This is vital as it can also support the managements  decision-making process while introducing EAI Lesson 2 Prioritising the importance of EAI adoption factors on adoption lifecycle phases can further enhance the decision making process in LGAs. During the mapping of factors, the importance of factors was not recognised Prioritising the factors can assist LGA officials in realising and understanding the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs Lesson 3 Findings on the mapping of factors and prioritising the importance of factors on adoption lifecycle phases reflect that each interviewee from LGA_A has relatively different conception while mapping the factors and prioritising the importance of factors on adoption lifecycle phases. This may also illustrate that within different LGAs interviewees understanding, knowledge and ability to comprehend the importance of factors may differ Lesson 4 Findings related to the mapping of factors and prioritising the importance of factors cannot be generalised as they may also differ from one LGA to the other Hitherto, the authors highlighted the individual elements of the contributions and research novelty presented in this paper. However, at the wider context this research aimed to enhance the technical decision making process while adopting EAI technologies in LGAs. This was achieved by proposing and validating a novel model \(Figure 1 for EAI adoption in the practical arena \(LGA_A The key beneficiaries are the decision makers and practitioners within LGAs, and researchers within the academic community. All of these benefit from the research in this paper as a guideline to analyse and understand EAI adoption in LGAs. In doing so this research work significantly contributes to the body of knowledge and practice in the areas of EAI and the local government domain by providing sufficient support to the decision makers in speeding up the EAI adoption process in LGAs   7.
