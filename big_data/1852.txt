S Nagabhushan KPIT Cummins Info. Pvt. Ltd Bangalore, India nagabhushanab@kpitcummins.com   Abstract the phonocardiography \(PCG\ provides a recording of the heart sounds. This information is diagnostically more important. Many disease of the heart cause changes in the heart sounds and additional murmurs before other signs and symptoms appear. Hence heart sound analysis by auscultation is the 
primary test conducted by physician to assess the condition of the heart. PCG signals or heart sounds have been studied extensively from past many years. Phonocardiography play an important role in cardiac care as they are non-invasive, non-expensive but accurate monitoring method for valves functioning, it is easily repeatable with no risk to the patient. However, heart diagnosis by auscultation requires high skills and experience of the listener 1 Heart fai l u re a n d stro k e c a u s e b i g b u rd en  on s o ci ety d u e to their high costs of care, lower quality of life and premature death PCG signal is one vital physiological signal that telemonitoring systems normally pay attention [2  We pr o p os e d a telecardiogarphy system for PCG data access and a new XML

The audio application services of mobile networks were used to transfer the XML based PCG data to the experts over mobile networks, and found that improved decision making with low cost in terms of bandwidth and complexity   Keywords-phonocardiography, telemedicine, telecardiography XML standards, biosignal processing, heart or cardiac sounds digital auscultations, DICOM, HL7 I  I NTRODUCTION  Telemedicine is the application of telecommunications and computer technology to deliver timely health services to those 
in need by the transmission of necessary expertise information among geographically dispersed parties, including physicians and patients,  resulting in improved patient care and potentially cost effectiveness. From the technology stand point, the telemedicine technology includes hardware, software, and medical equipment and communication networks Telemedicine can be implemented in two ways, one way is to store and forward concept which involves complication and storing of information relating to audio, video images and clips ECG, PCG, etc. The stored information in the digital form is sent to the expert for review, interpretation and advice at his/her convenience. The expert’s opinion can be transmitted 
back without any immediate compulsion on the consultant’s time during his/her busy professional schedule. The second way of telemedicine involves real-time exchange of information between the two centre simultaneously and communicating interactively. It may include video conferencing, interviewing and examining the patients transmission of the images of various anatomic sites auscultation of the heart and lung sound and a continuous review of various images. A typical telemonitoring system includes medical signal or images acquisition, data storing, data analysis, and data transmission subsystems. Thus a telemonitoring system needs to have sufficient data processing power and processing speed to handle the required high 
computation overhead. Recent release of iphone and the powerful mobile programming platforms such as J2ME, XML etc, and a mobile handset based telemonitoring solution has become possible. In this paper, we  propose  a  system for telecardiography for phonocardiography \(PCG\ signal monitoring, interpreting, representing and transmission system utilizing the cellular mobile transmission networks. This system has good extensibility and can easily incorporate other physiological signals to suit various telehealth scenarios. In order to ensure the interoperability and support further data mining and data semantics, a novel method is proposed using XML schema exclusively for PCG data exchange and 
monitoring over mobile devices. This XML schema is named as mPCG-xml. The PCG data in mPCG-xml format is tested over mobile devices as a preliminary study The organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2 some of the related work is discussed, ECG data record standards and their limitations for PCG records. In section 3 the features of PCG signal and PCG-XML schema, high-level implementation architecture with open standards are described We discuss the proposed model that includes mobile system architecture for remote PCG data access, transmission and 


      monitoring, XML schema for PCG data processing over mobile network using mPCG-xml in section 4. Concluding remarks are given in section 5 with future scope for study  II   ECG DATA RECORDS AND OPEN XML STANDARDS  From a signal perspective PCG is a time – series data with acoustical properties, the signal characteristic such as amplitudes, duration, frequency components noise and murmurs are very important for clinical investigations.  There are many standards for the representation of time series data for physiological signals such as electrocardiogram – ECG electroencephalogram – EEG, EOG and others. In particular ECG is the most common and extensively used health care and telemedicine applications. Now, we explore the possibility of using existing standards for ECG data format and record structure for phonocardiography records. In ECG record and standards such as MIT-BIH [5 use s fl a t fi l e st r u c t u r e ha s poor support for the analysis and cumbersome to apply for the phonocardiography records.  The Standard Communications Protocol for Computer-assisted Electrocardiography \(SCPECG\ [9  rel a tiv e l y  w e ll esta b lish e d f o r th e in t e r c h a n g e  encoding and storage of digital ECG data. The data level in the standard includes the ECG signal, patient demographics and ECG  administrative data, as well as measurement and interpretation results. But has limitations such as binary file format, poor annotation support and non-human readability Emerging standards such as Health Level Seven \(HL7\ for the electronic interchange of clinical, financial and administrative information among independent healthcare oriented computer systems is well received and adopted globally for the healthcare applications. The HL7 takes an integration approach focuses on synchronizing the databases of multiple application systems. As a de facto standard for the electronic exchange of clinical and administrative data, an HL7 message is able to represent ECG, waveform, measurements, a computer analysis of the waveform, and demographics data.  Some of the challenges and issues is  that the message format is not user friendly, to incorporate any modification and is expensive The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine DICOM\ is created as a protocol for image data exchange and difficult to put the bio-signals. However the implementation of this format requires a through understanding of the DICOM standard and demand precise implementation expertise. In recent times, the XML recommendation World Wide Web Consortium \(W3C\recommendation has become a de-facto data format standard for storage, hierarchical presentation and visualization of data as a tree, and transmission of XML on TCP-IP protocol and Internet applications.  For example, a majority of HL7 standards and recommendation are based on XML and related open standards. The XML offers a simple scalable, highly interoperable solutions and highly humanreadable form as well as seamless integration with machines protocols and application architectures. The FDA Centre for Drug Evaluation and Research has proposed recommendations for the exchange of time-series data. It includes a hierarchical structure for the representation of ECG signals and encoding as XML file. This standard   consists of a domain-independent interface for exchanging several types of medical information and a common platform for clinical transactions. One major limitation of this solution is that it partially addresses ECG data content issues. The ecgML [10 is an oth e r  X M L  b a s e d  standards for presentation and storage of ECG and effective XML transformations using XSLT technology in various formats such as comma separated file and, scalable vector graphics \(SVG\. We take inspiration from ecgML and extended with PCG specific tags. Some of our observations is that it is more ECG specific and difficult to represent the unique PCG records and real-time PCG data interpretation and diagnosis annotations, domain-specific phonocardiography ontology. It is observed that a dedicated markup language for phonocardiography using open XML standard for storage format and structure\, transmission \(real-time data, security compressions etc.\, presentation and visualization \(graphical s and audio rendering\s possible using PCG-XML. in order to ensure the data interoperability and support further data mining and data semantics, a new XML schema is designed specially for the PCG data exchange and representation on mobile devices. This XML schema is named mPCG-xml. The PCG data in mPCG-xml format is tested as a pilot study III  F EATURE OF PCG  S IGNALS AND PCG-XML Normally cardiac cycle contains two major sounds: first heart sound \(S1\and second heart sound \(S2\.  The S1 occurs during isovolumic contraction period consisting of mitral valve closure, tricuspid valve and aortic valve opening in a specific order. There are also third heart sound \(S3\d fourth heart sound \(S4\ also carry clinical information.  Murmurs are sounds caused by the cardiovascular diseases, aberrations and defects valve functioning.  A  PCG signal characteristics such as low frequency, period and duration of the occurrence, of heart sounds, noise and signal amplitudes have close relationship with the electrocardiograph \(ECG\d contains valuable clinical information.  The profile and waveform of the PCG helps in detecting various type heart diseases in particular heart valve disease and accurate calculation of heart functioning, volume and pumping efficiency etc.   A typical normal cardiac sounds profile and an abnormal sound profile due to aortic-stenosis is shown in Fig. 1   Figure 1  Normal cardiac sound and Aortic-stenosis 


      However, the heart diagnosis by auscultation requires special skills and professional experience to make correct interpretation and clinical diagnosis. With recent advancements in biomedical signal processing, the digital phonocardiography offers powerful techniques and methods by applying the advanced signal processing techniques and produces a digital phonocardiography records. The PCG data acquisition, data storage and file format, transmission and interpretation, and  of the phonocardiography signals are technically challenging and used in the detection and investigation of heart diseases such as  stenosis, heart valve insufficiency, murmurs, septal defect, etc. They are normally difficult to detect by electrocardiogram \(ECG The digitally processed waveform is to record the PCG signal characteristics, time intervals measured in milliseconds and we can obtain the mitral component \(from Q in QRS complex to first heart sound  – S1\ologic systole \(S1 first sound to S2 – second heart sound\, heart rate electromechanical systole, cardiol ogic systole index etc. These are very useful to derive the heart and valve parameters and detection of various diseases. The PCG record is printed on a paper and stored. In particular, the cardiologists prefer to hear these heart sounds and effective clinical investigation. This is dependent on the hearing abilities and expertise of the cardiologists. Unfortunately, the PCG record structure and format, acquisition process, storage, transmission and annotation etc. vary significantly among the manufactures and create serious interoperability among the health care standards and telemedicine applications. The current standards for ECG are recommended to store the PC G record.  In general, we cannot as they are not designed for PCG. Even the XML standard for ECG is also not easily extendable, and does not support PCG annotation and do not speak the “language” of the PCG and creating barriers for the doctors and experts They also have implications when we want to integrate into the healthcare architecture and applications. Hence, PCGXML, a markup language specifically designed for the presentation, visualization,   and transmission of PCG data and seamless integration with the telecardiology applications Telemonitoring for remote PCG data access and transmission of PCG data over mobile network using mPCG-xml ensure the data interoperability and support data mining and data semantics IV  R EMOTE PCG  D ATA A CCESS S YSTEM AND M PCGXML SCHEMA  The architecture of remote PCG monitoring system is illustrated in Fig. 2, the mobile phone is the main part of PCG telemonitoring system. The central server is used to store all the biological signals from patient. A typical telemonitoring system includes medical signal or image acquisition, data storing, data mining and knowledge management techniques The core communication of PCG monitoring system is done through the mobiles carried by both user and telemonitoring service provider. In this telemonitoring system we focus on plain mobile phone handsets. Since the computational powers of the mobile phone handsets are expanding rapidly, current mobile phones possess considerable computation powers which can perform runtime complex tasks such as 3D games, MP3 and MPEG encoding and decoding  Figure 2  System architecture of a mobile based PCG data access system Mobile processors are feasible to utilize for process compress, and transmit data in real time for various telehealth applications. The mPCG-xml is used for the transmission and representation of PCG data over mobile network. The PatientRecord starts with a root element and contains mPatientID and is unique to each patient. It also contains the mPCGDate, mPCGtime, mPCGdiagnosis, mPCGCaseHistory  etc. tags that describes the date and time of the recorded PCG and any related case history mPCGRecordingDevice is an important element that captures the specific recording device characteristics  setting and configurations, calibration reference waveforms etc   an is mandatory mPCGRecordData includes three main sub-components mPCGWaveforms  mPCGAnnotations and mPCGMeasurements and Annotations would typically be used to describe events specific to the corresponding channel. It defines a time point or interval, which can be used for performing the PCG measurements   Figure 3  A sample PCG-XML record A typical PCG record in the mPCG-xml is shown in Fig. 3 A set of tools in Java are being developed and are used to produce and generate the mPCG-xml. The XML parser validates the generated mPCG-xml. The graphics tools are enabled for the visualization and display. The annotator facilities the annotation of the PCG record manually. The PCG parser allows the user to read the PCG records and access their contents and structure, whereas the PCG viewer provides 


      onscreen display of the corresponding waveform data. The visualization graphics over mobile phones is shown in Fig 4 which helps in analysis and identifying the major features of PCG signal for critical diagnosis by experts  Figure 4  The mPCG-xml parser and graphical display on mobile PDA The hierarchical structures of the mPCG-xml using its elements/tags are displayed in the user interface. The mPCGxml viewer graphically locates boundaries \(i.e. beginning peak, and end\f the heart sounds S1, S2 etc. and signal characteristics on mobile device and assist doctors and patient Since, the mPCG-xml is based on advantages of XML technologies, like the ability to present application and format independent solution for representation and exchange of PCG data and structure. Various XSL Transformations \(XSLT stored as XSL files and applied on the dynamically\vert the PCG-XML into user and/or application-specific data formats, such as Moving Picture Experts Group \(MPEG audio\ and SVG/Portable Network Graphics \(PNG graphics\, etc. The data and metadata contained in a mPCGxml record are also useful pattern recognition, FFT and spectral estimation, etc. for further signal analysis V  C ONCLUSIONS  We have shown that, the ECG data standards such as MITBIH, SCP-ECG, DICOM, MFER, HL7 Version 3 are inadequate and do not cater to the specific requirements and they are unable to the represent the PCG records in a highly interoperable manner. XML standards such as ecgML may be used for the PCG also and but we have shown that, the markup semantics are more ECG specific and   it is more appropriate to have a dedicated, highly extensible markup language such that it captures the PCG record and deliver the record data in various formats such as CVS, SVG and audio formats. The PCG-XML standard and its schema is used for exclusively for phonocardiography. Further we have developed mPCG-xml for transferring remote PCG data and visual display over mobile phones provides assistance for prompt medical decision. It supports the hierarchal structure that captures the data, tags and elements in an effective manner such it is human readable and will enable the seamless integration of PCG data into healthcare architecture and applications. The semantics and domain ontology of phonocardiography is adequately represented and speaks the “language” of the domain experts and cardiologists. The annotation of the PCG data and waveform is useful for writing the meta information related to the clinical investigations and helps in cardiac care. The mPCG-xml is highly extensible and easily transformed into the other XML standards using XSLT technology.   Some times, ECG is used as a reference signal for the S1, S2 sound analysis and hence, we have also dedicated element for the ECG data. The mPCG-xml capturesthe heart performance characteristics and valve efficiency indexes with manual annotation and can be automated, and used in data mining of PCG databases  The preliminary and experimental results using mPCG-xml and its schema implementation is quite encouraging and demonstrates the easy integration with telemedicine healthcare applications, in particular the interoperability issues and its effectiveness in presentation, visualization and dynamic transformations of PCG data. In the future, work, we continue the enhancements to the mPCG-xml and implementation prototype of the complete PCG databases A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Dr. R.P Reddy, Principal, REVA college of Engineering, Bangalore for his constant inspiration and motivation for the research work.

CONCLUSIONS A fuzzy integrated analytic hierarchy process approach model for selecting a strategic big-sized R&amp;D program in the sector of energy technology development was established in this paper as an extended model of the AHP approach. We demonstrated herein the results compiled when the fuzzy integrated multi-criteria decision making method approach was employed. We created a one-tier hierarchy structure and established the list of criteria and sub-criteria using 6 criteria namely energy environment \(EE ES technical spin-off \(TS M KM C weights of sub-criteria using fuzzy integrated AHP approach using triangular fuzzy numbers. In terms of criteria list, which was based the fuzzy AHP approach, technical spin-off ranks first, followed by KIER mission, economical spin-off 


first, followed by KIER mission, economical spin-off marketability, energy environment, and cost. Although the quantitative data presented in this paper, which garnered by the peer reviews of experts, is limited, we have efficiently demonstrated the selection of a big-sized R&amp;D programs in the sector of energy technology development based on the fuzzy integrated analytic hierarchy process with triangular fuzzy numbers Finally, this research provides energy policy makers with the fundamental data needed to establish the framework of a strategic big-sized R&amp;D programs for producing well focused R&amp;D outcomes instead of simple outputs. As a further study of this research, we are planning to apply the fuzzy integrated analytic network process approach [12] and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process/data envelopment analysis hybrid model for measuring the relative efficiency of a strategic big-sized R&amp;D programs from an econometric viewpoint [13-16  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We wish to express our gratitude to the expert who participated in the peer-review process  NOMENCLATURE AHP:   Analytic hierarchy process C:    Cost CI:    Consistency index CR:    Consistency ratio DEA:   Data envelopment analysis EE:    Energy environment    ES:    Economical spin-off KIER:   Korea institute of energy research KM:    KIER mission M :    Marketability HE:    Hydrogen economy HERC:   Hydrogen energy R&amp;D center HOP:   High oil prices MCDM:  Multi-criteria decision making method TS:    Technical spin-off UNFCCC: United nations framework convention of climate change  REFERENCES 1] S.K.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
