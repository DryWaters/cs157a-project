Grey measurement based on Rough set Granule calculations   Jian Liu, Zhili Huang, Shunxiang Wu, Ruiyi Chen Department of Automation, Center for Systems and Control Xiamen University Xiamen 361005, China E-mail: Liu66507com@126.com   Abstract  This paper put the Rough set methodology based on the information table disposal to expand the dual binary\ relations described by the neighborhood system. To make full use of logic operations including AND operation by-bit, XOR operation by-bit and NOR operation by-bit, gains the certain and uncertain information among the various decision-making factors. The use of knowledge related with Grey system theory, establishes their mathematical model for decision making and data mining, according to the principle of the priority of certain information in decision-making and the ambiguity degree from small to big. At last, a new method for data mining is proposed by the use of combining grey system theory and Rough set  1. Introduction   In the early 1960s, L.A.Zadeh proposed fuzzy sets Fuzzy Sets\heoretical computer scientists and logician try to resolve the vague concept of G.Frege through this theory, but unfortunately, fuzzy set is not computed, and there is not mathematical formula to describe this vague concept, therefore, it is impossible to calculate the specific numbers of ambiguity element on its border After 20 years in the early 1980s, Z. Pawlak presents the Rough set in allusion to the borderline region thought of G. Frege, and puts those individuals which could not be confirmed, to vest in the borderline region, which \(and that borderline region\s defined as the sets of the difference between up-Approximate and under-Approximate sets. As up-Approximate sets and under-Approximate sets can be described by the assured mathematical formula that equivalence relationship given, the number of ambiguity elements can be calculated, namely the extent of ambiguity between true and false can be calculated, is so as to achieve the borderline thought of G.Frege, which we call it the uncertain information sets. Rough sets is a new mathematical tool to handle a vague and imprecise information problem, rather than fuzzy sets \(Fuzzy Sets\for the application of modern computer, this theory is undoubtedly one of the most challenging fields 1982, Julong Deng, the Chinese scholar, Professor created a grey system theory. Grey system theory take small sample", "poor information" uncertainty system of "some part information known, some part information unknown " for research objects, to develop and extract valuable information mainly through the formation of "Some part" information known, and implement the correct description and effective monitoring and controlling for the action of system's operation or the law of evolution. Grey system theory major study the problem of uncertainty which probability, statistics and fuzzy math are difficult to solve. Gray number is a form of representation to gray system action. Gray degree of gray number reflects the degree of uncertainty for people’s recognition on the grey system. So a gray degree of gray number, and theoretical background or domain that gray number brings should have an inseparable relationship Gray number is the number which is not or can not find temporarily a white number as its "representative such as value of the general prior forecast, and so on Gray number has a few several categories below: the gray number of only below-boundary, the gray number of only up-boundary, the interval gray number, the consecutive gray number and the discrete gay number black number and white number  2. The Information Granule and binary logical operation of Rough Set  The so-called Information Granule is the reflection of finite ability of human in processing and storing information. Owing to the finite human capacity, a

great deal of complex information was divided to some simple blocks according to their characteristic, and the block marked off like this can be seem as a Granule The procedure of processing information is called Information Granule. For example, Information Granule of parking lot problem is that dividing the parking lot to many blocks according to the performances ,models and sizes of cars, whereas the each block is used to park a sort of car. The blocks at this are Granule. This is an informal example of Information Granule of parking lot problem. Granule involves partition from integer to segment. More clearly, it integrates with uncertainty, comparability and functionality. It is evident that Granule performs the important role in many subjects. For example interval analysis, quantitative analysis, blocking, rough sets theory, d-s theory, sample learning , qualitative process theory, decision tree, semantic network constraint programming, image segmentation, group analysis and so on In mathematics, each individual combined with certain block clusters makes up of one neighborhood system. If all clusters in a neighborhood system are nonempty, the neighborhood system is an overlay. If all blocks constitute a partition, the neighborhood system is reduced to Rough set system. And if the discussion is restricted to real number, the neighborhood system is reduced to interval computation. Neighborhood is a common concept which has been introduced to data mining, intelligent system, soft computing and logic and so on. We commit ourselves to its structure theory, and also appeal to its represent method. So this paper extended information table process of the Rough sets methodology to the binary relation described by the neighborhood system The Logical algebra subject was firstly founded by English mathematician George Boolean, so people also call it Boolean algebra. Unlike ordinary algebra, the Logical algebra has different concepts. It only has two states: 0 and 1, which represent the logical relation among digits instead of the big-small relation. The logical algebra is the mathematical base of analyzing and designing digital system. The operation formula is quite different from normal operation formula, and it has three basic operations: AND, XOR, NOR  3. The Granule logic computation based on the number of binary system  Suppose S = \(U, A\ is an information system, of which U={u 1 u 2   u m is individual domain, A = \(a1 a2,…, am\n attribute set. U can be divided into Equivalence class which uncrosses each other by arbitrary subset of B, A. Equivalence class is defined as Granule, and obviously Granule is the expansion of Rough set theory, because the implementation of the Granule computation is much faster and much more flexible than that of equivalence class computation Table 1 gives the information systems that expert subordinate departments attach to the individual Table 1.Single attribute of the list Experts serial number U Subordinate department A Experts serial number U Subordinate departments A u 1 A 1 u 7 A 2  u 2 A 2 u 8 A 1  u 3 A 1 u 9 A 1  u 4 A 3 u 10 A 2  u 5 A 4 u 11 A 5  u 6 A 3 u 12 A 1 We use equivalence class to define Granule, in table 1, according to the classification of two attributes include expert and subordinate departments, obtain quotient set  U/IND A 1  A 2 A 3  A 4 A 5   there into [A 1  u 1 u 3 u 8 u 9 u 12  A 2 u 2 u 7 u 10  A 3 u 4 u 6  A 4 u 5  A 5  u 11 Here we call the elements --equivalence class Granule in quotient set for For each element in Granule its location, using this element’s subscript denoted, can be presented in the macrocosm U. If the subscript is corresponding to the digits of binary system number, then the Granule can be defined by a number of binary system, that is u i U, corresponding to set the number of binary system on the corresponding i digit 1. Clearly, the length of the binary system number exactly equals to base U, such as  A 1  011 001 A 2  100 100 A 3  000 000 A 4  000 000 A 5  000 010 an d [A 1  A 2  A 3 A 4  A 5  e re called separately to the names of the 1, the 2, the 3, the 4 and the 5 number of binary system The table 2 uses the two forms of enumerated elements and binary system number to describe the partition of U. Its first column denotes the names of elements in quotient set U / IND \(A\nd column enumerates each Gran ule, its third column is the number of binary system, it is worth noticing that each element in quotient set all is a subset or the name of subset on the U. Compared to the number of elements on the U, the number of elements in quotient set is much smaller, so it was already a data reduction from the macrocosm to quotient set. This is the essential problem of Granule computing, and is one of

Data mining is usually to find the association rules given in the relations with certain form: Let X and Y are two basic sets given in the relations, if the times, which the association rules or individual given in the relations occurred, reach s% or more, we calls the association rules can be extracted marking as \(X, Y\. Here given the general process for searching the association rules \(X, Y 1\omputing the combination formats of all the X and Y may be 2\ Counting the time which some possible formats appear in the given format 3\To find out the association rules of which the appearance time s% given in the relations Now in terms of these principles, we can seek the association rules through Granule computing Obviously, the number of the association rules \(X, Y which satisfied the conditions the number of Granule in quotient set, so it is another data reduction from quotient set to the association rules set It is one association degree between experts from different departments and the same excellent results of evaluation For this we fully integrate the Boolean calculation of binary digit, which puts forward more simple to determine the relations Table 4.

In table 4 are presented the corresponding binary AND operation under the combination and gaining possession of the assessment experts’ subordinate department and the excellent results of the evaluation and their results are listed in corresponding to the right column. the assessment experts from the sector A 1 and the excellent results of the evaluation are present to the bottom line in table 4, which the total number that 1 appears is 4; if s = 10, clearly A 1 meet the requirements; if S = 5, At this point A 1 A 2 A 3 are all to meet requirements, if the data mining asked to mine the two rules of the largest association degree then how to select again from A 2 A 3  In the binary on-bit XOR logic operation: while input the same two digits, it will output 0, while input the two different digits, it will output 1. In the binary on-bit NOR logic operation: what input has 1 then output 0, what input is all 0 then output 1. For the combination of the various Experts’ subordinate departments and the excellent evaluation, the doneness of binary on-bit XOR and on-bit NOR operations were shown in tables 5, 6 Table 5.

The Associated Gray Matrix of Granule computing based on the number of binary system  We can conclude clearly from Table 4, 5, 6: the sum of probability gained in the same context is 1 after the AND, XOR, NOR operation. The binary sort of table can be understood as: the sort of the voting results, 1 presented assent, 0 presented opposition. For the binary sort of excellent results of assessment, it can be represented the survey results that the projects assessed by public opinion, so that its all sort in each table remains unchanged. For U/IND \(departments A 1  A 2 A 3  A 4 A 5  he di f f e rent bi n a r y  arrangement listed by the different departments can be understood as: the projects of assessment sort in various sectors with internal point of view. 1 or 0 are on both sides in the table 4, 5, 6, explaining the experts have the same points of view with public opinion for assessment of this project, are in favor of or against this project's implementation. If 1 and 0 on both sides are not appearance at the same time, show that opinions of group of the assessment experts and the views of public opinion on this project are different and the implementation of this project needs to assess once again The results of on-bit AND operation used in this paper are defined as certainty information, that of onbit XOR operation are defined as uncertainty information, and that of on-bit NOR operation are defined as the opposed information. The probabilities of their counterparts were expressed as 1 AA A A tf t f   Obviously: the association degree of each evaluation attributes are all a grey number 1  A A f t

In Table 7 the same line reflects the degree of correlation predicted by the internal experts within the same departments for the various the results of the ballots the same column represents the degree of correlation predicted by experts in  different departments for the same voting results Definition 1 Suppose the background of the theory produced by gray number  is      is the degree of measurement that Gray number  admits the domain, then calls   g     1 gray degree of the gray number   Suppose   1   as        g     we can obtain the gray degree between subordinate departments of assessment experts and the excellent results of evaluation 1 11  1/4 AA g     2 22 7/12 AA g     3 33 1/2 AA g     4 44 7/12 AA g     5 55 7/12 AA g     12345 4 12 1 3 1/12 1/12 0 0 AAAAA ttttt     12345 AA A A A tt tt t   132 4 5      AAAAA ggg g g        So we learn that A1, A3 are the two information extracted  5. Conclusion  From individual to global then to the classification Granule’s calculate gets a less data tables of Granule, it is said the first reduction of the individual; second according to the data tables on Granule combination and gets a combination data tables of Granule ,from the data tables we can easily find the available association rules, it corresponds to the further reduction. This paper first by the binary number bit and \(AND operator to find out the information association rules that meet the request then according to with the same certainty association rules of the information, to conduct on binary number bit or \(XOR\d by-bit non \( NOR\ operation. When data mining according the following rules: firstly chose that with the biggest certainty association information ; secondly chose that with less uncertainty information that own the same certainty of association – Grayscale’s descending principles of data mining. This paper use the grey system theory and Rough set combination give a new and rapid method of extraction association rules data mining, it is significance and valuable. So it is worth for further study  6.

The lunar reference geoid radius of 1738 km is not a good average value for the terrain at either pole.  The lunar south pole is part of the Aitken Basin, and the GSSR Digital Elevation Model elevations ha ve an average of -1880 m within 200 km of the south pole.  The lunar north pole region has an average elevation of -1673 m within 150 km of the north pole.  These averag es were subtracted from base site reference altitude to get the value of \221h\222 used in equation 2.  This effectively gaves the base sites a higher elevation relative to the local average elevation  For selected base sites, solar illumination and DTE communications averages were computed for tower heights from 2 m to 1500 m, and in some cases 3000 m.  Then these tower heights plus adjusted altitudes and base locations were used in equations 1 through 7 to get predicted values of the yearly average metrics.  The results are shown in figures 14 and 15.  Figure 14 shows black curves of equation 5 plotted parametrically with distance from the pole.  For the selected sites, the computed yearly average solar illumination is shown by squares, connected by a dashed line with the theoretical yearly average for the same location and tower heights The theoretical values are marked with X\222s.  South lunar Pole sites are in blue and the lunar north pole sites are in red.  The plots show reasonable agreement of computed values and theory, with the computed value never exceeding the theoretical.   Figure 15 shows black curves of equation 7 plotted parametrically with distance from the pole.  Th e value of L0 was set to zero for the parametric curves.  Fi gure 15 include computed and theoretical values of the yearly average DTE communications for the same sites as figure 14, using the same symbol and color conventions  At no site will a tower of 1500 m or less provide both 100 average yearly solar illumination and 100% average DTE communications.  Towers of 1500 m at sites NB and NC will raise the average yearly solar illumination to 100 But for the lunar south pole sites, like B1, towers of over 2500 m are required to rais e the average yearly solar illumination to 100%.  This is because the peaks Malapert 002 peaks  t\002 1  212  0 1 4 R      6  The yearly average Earth co mmunications, DTE, is then given by the equation        L L  L L Hm R  8  The obscuring effect of these p eaks is also shown in figure 5, where the peak Malapert t 006 002    L  2 cos 180 abs 180 sin 006 212 003 003  002 latitude These variables are   003  and Leibnitz 002 obscure the view of the sun from the lunar south pole.  Equation 8 gives the elevation, Hp, above a spherical surface needed to see the winter sun over a peak of elevation Hm at a distance, d from the pole.  Equation 8 provided values in Figures 4 and 14 for the Malapert 003 and Leibnitz 212 003 is at +10 degrees azimuth  Figure 15 shows the yearly average DTE communication varies more with distance fr om the pole toward the prime meridian that with tower height above the local terrain Towers up to 3000 m at the poles do not make significant improvements in the DTE co mmunications average.  The computed yearly average DT E communications for site NG exceed the predicted values fo r towers between 32 and 1500 meters tall.  This is because the view northward from site NG toward the Earth looks across the floor of Byrd Crater which averages about -2500 m elevation  Considerations for Photovoltaic Array Design  The lunar pole sites create some difficult challenges for designing a continuously operating photovoltaic power system.  A site with continuous solar illumination will see the Sun travel through 360 degrees of azimuth during 1 synodic month.  A photovoltaic power system would require several permanently mounted photovoltaic arrays pointed in several directions, or would have to continually track the Sun with a single array.  Sin ce a single array requires much less mass, the design of the solar tracking system is examined here  The requirement to continually track the Sun could be met by installing the photovoltaic array on a vertical axle oriented parallel to the lunar spin axis.  At the lunar south pole, this axle would rotate counterclockwise with the Sun to keep the array normal to the solar radiation.  This requires a foundation to support the axle cross beam structures to hold the array on the axle, and a drive system to turn the array.  This system also requires a solution to the \221cable wrap\222 problem, in order to continually track the Sun.  After 1 synodic month the array has turned through 360 degrees and needs to continue rotating in the same direction.  Power and control cables from the array need to go through multiple slip rings, or the array needs to rotate 360 degrees clockwise to unwrap the cables.  A slip ring design is further complicated by the requirement to tolerate the fine dust on    arccos 004  005  b t cos if 


  10 the lunar surface.  Using the \221cable unwrap\222 method means stopping power production for a short amount of time, once per synodic month  A heliostat design using a focusing mirror may provide a low-mass solution to the \221cable wrap\222 problem [Ref 10   Figure 16 shows a photovoltaic array installed horizontal to the local terrain.  A parabolic section mirror is installed above the array, angled at approximately 45 degrees to the local horizontal.  This mirror is suspended from the crossbar of a mast placed next to the array.  The mast could also be the structure for the Lunar Co mmunications Terminal \(LCT antennas.  The mirror is suspe nded from an axle that is oriented parallel to the lunar spin axis and rotates once per synodic month to continually reflect solar radiation onto the array.  The mirror can continue to track after 360 degrees revolution, since there are no cables attached to the moving part.  This heliostat \221periscope\222 design provides continuous solar tracking, but is partially shaded once per revolution when the Sun passes behind the support mast  Shaping the mirror into a para bolic arc concentrates solar power for a small increase in mass.  The tradeoffs should consider the relative mass-perunit area of the mirror and the photovoltaic panels, the reflectivity of the mirror material and the relative masses of an array-support axle versus a mirror heliostat axle plus mast  Additional flat \221periscope\222 mirrors mounted on the crossbar could be used to direct solar light to areas nearby.  This provides an efficient method of lighting work areas because it bypasses the inefficiencies of the photovoltaic system battery storage, and electric lighting.  If the photovoltaic power system is located on a crat er rim \(as in Figure 16\a flat \221periscope\222 mirror could provide continuous lighting to exploration crews in the perman ently shadowed areas within the crater.  Sufficiently large heliostat mirrors could redirect enough sunlight to run photovoltaic arrays at remote locations.  This would provide very efficient power transfer for operating within the permanently shaded areas  5  C ONCLUSIONS   Separating the lunar pole solar illumination problem into terrain horizon mask and solar motion computations simplified the production of illumination metrics.  Using a simplified model of average solar motion allowed quick comparisons between lunar south pole sites.  The results show that within 100 km of the lunar south pole, solar illumination is maximized at previously identified site locations.  These sites are small areas on the peaks of isolated mountains and crater rims.  No site provides 100 yearly average for both solar illumination and DTE communication.  Lunar north pole sites were also examined No site at either pole prov ides 100% yearly average for solar illumination unless a tower at least 1500 m is placed on one of the best lunar north pole sites  The best lunar south pole sites are on the rim of Shackleton crater, and the ridge west of Sh ackleton crater.  These 3 sites have yearly average of solar illumination between 93 and 97%.  The Sites have 100% solar power generation capability about 85 to 92% of the year.  For both of these metrics, Site B1 on the ridge West of Shackleton crater has the highest solar illumination values.  Site B1 has direct-toEarth visibility of the entire Earth disk about 51% of each month.  More detailed analysis of site B1 can use the terrain horizon masks presented here, coupled with more detailed true-of-date solar motion computations  Examination of the site solar illumination profiles at 40meter resolution shows the peaks of illumination are distributed over many points.  The locations with greater than 80% solar illumination are spread over 100s of meters This supports the conclusion that the Digital Elevation Model has adequate sampling to show the true terrain characteristics  The lunar north pole base sites NB and NC have yearly average solar illumination around 97%, and have 100 solar power generation capability about 88 to 92% of the time for the average year  The yearly average for 100% DTE communications at the best lunar north pole and south pole sites are all around 50%.  The yearly average DTE communications does not vary significantly with tower height, but does increase to 100% for sites about 100 km from the poles toward the lunar prime meridian 6  A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  The author expresses thanks to Martin A.
