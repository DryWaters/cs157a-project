obtained for each of the three methods on the adult data of the United States census in 2000 show their effectiveness and applicability 1 Introduction Earlier approaches for quantitative ation rules mining require discretizing the domains of quantitative attributes into intervals in order to discover quantitative association rules But these intervals may not be concise and meaningful enough for humans to obtain nontrivial knowledge from the discovered rules Also existing quantitative mining algorithms either ignore or overemphasize elements near the boundary of an interval Instead of using sharp intervals some work has recently been done on the use of fuzzy sets in discovering association rules among quantitative attributes in flat tables e.g 3 9  These approaches assume a flat relational table structure 
In this paper we apply the same fuzziness concepts to OLAP data mining where the basic structure is a data cube  A cube is a set of data organized similar to a multidimensional array of values representing measures over several dimensions Explicitly OLAP mining ntegrates online analytical processing with data mining this substantially enhances the power and flexibility of data mining and makes mining an interesting exploratory process e.g 7 8  S o  g e n e r a ting o nline a s s o c i a tio n r ul e s is considered an important research area of data mining e.g 1 4 5 6 A ltho ugh the s e a lgo r ithms improve d t he o n line generation of association rules it is still an open problem They use data cubes with binary attributes whereas most real life databases include quantitative attributes Motivated by this we developed a novel approach for online association 
rules mining We contribute to the ongoing research on multidimensional online data mining by proposing a general architecture that constructs and uses a fuzzy data cube for knowledge discovery This allows users to query a given database for fuzzy association rules for different values of support and confidence We present three different methods to mine fuzzy association rules in the constructed fuzzy data cube namely one-dimensional multi-dimensional and hybrid integrates the two other methods fuzzy association rules mining To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to utilize fuzziness in OLAP mining Experimental results obtained on the adult data of United States census in 2000 show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed three methods

So consider a quantitative attribute say x  It is possible to define some fuzzy sets for x  with a membership function per fuzzy set such that each value of x qualifies to be in one or more of these fuzzy sets Let    21 l xxxx fffF  beaset of l fuzzy sets associated with x  Membership function of the j th fuzzy set in x F  denoted j x f 265  represents a mapping from the domain of x into the interval   I f 1  v j x f 265 then value v of x totally belongs to fuzzy set j x f  On the other hand 0  v j x f 265 means that v is not a member of j x f All other values between 0 and 1 exclusive specify 223partial membership\224 This concept is used next in building a fuzzy data cube    X Y Z Total Total Total Total Sum Total y 1 y n x m z 1 z o  1 1 x f 2 1 x f 3 1 x f 1 m x f 2 m x f x 1 1 1 z f 2 1 z f 1 1 y f 2 1 y f 3 1 y f 2 o z f 3 n y f Figure 2 An example 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube 32.98 29.38 62.36 3.10 17.56 13.22 12.58 15.9 3.10 6.48 8.04 5.12 10.24 11.08 5.18 7.46 5.66 Total x 1 x 2 f 1 1 f 1 2 f 2 1 f 2 2 f 2 3 Total y 1 y 2 Dimension X Transaction Dimension Dime n s io n Y Sum Total Figure 3 An example 2-dimensional fuzzy data cube Consider a data cube with n dimensions and given an association rules mining task involved with dimensions d 1  d 2 205 d n of the data cube Each dimension of the cube contains 1 1  000  k i i l values where i l is the number of membership functions of attribute x i  k is the number of attributes both in dimension X  and 223+1\224 represents a special 223Total\224 value in which each cell stores the aggregation value of the previous rows Finally a three-dimensional fuzzy data cube is shown in Figure 2 where each dimension has two attributes and the number of membership functions of each attribute varies between 2 and 3 As the target is to find out some interesting and potentially useful fuzzy association rules with enough support and high confidence we end this section with the definition of fuzzy association rule Consider a database of transactions T  its set of attributes I  and the fuzzy sets associated with quantitative attributes in I Eachtransaction t i contains values of some attributes from I and each quantitative attribute in I is associated with at least two corresponding fuzzy sets A fuzzy association rule is defined as follows If X  x 1 x 2 311,x p is A  f 1 f 2 311,f p  then Y  y 1 y 2 311,y q is B  g 1 g 2 311,g q   where X  Y are itemsets i.e disjoint subsets of I and A and B contain the fuzzy sets associated with corresponding attributes in X and Y  respectively i.e f i is a fuzzy set related to attribute x i and g j is a fuzzy set related to attribute y j  3 OLAP Mining of Fuzzy Association Rules 3.1 Single Dimension Method Single dimension association rules mining concentrates on the correlation within one dimension by grouping the other dimension Shown in Figure 3 is an example of such a cube with two dimensions involved in the single dimension association rules mining process One of the dimensions is referred to as transaction dimension and the set of attributes associated with it constitute the other dimension By grouping attributes in the transaction dimension a transaction table can be transformed into a set-based table in which items sharing he same transactional attribute are merged into one tuple Note that there is no point in partitioning attributes in the transactional dimension into fuzzy sets because the mining process is performed in the non-transactional dimension After constructing the fuzzy data cube the process of association rules mining starts by identifying large itemsets An itemset is large if it is a combination of items that have a support over a predefined minimum support The mining process and hence identifying large itemsets is performed based on the sum of sharing rates denoted SR  and defined in terms of the degree of membership in the fuzzy sets If more than one membership function intersect with the real values of an attribute then all the cells related to these functions are updated So each cell in Figure 3 stores an SR value To generate fuzzy association rules all sets of items that have a support above a user specified threshold should be determined first Itemsets with at least a minimum support value are called large itemsets The fuzzy support value of itemset Y and its corresponding set of fuzzy sets F  denoted FSupport  Y  F  is computed as Total sum fxFf SR FY FSupport X in x all for n ji n j Yy fy i j n jj 001 001 002  002    3.2 Multidimensional Method In this method the correlation is among a set of dimensions i.e the items forming a rule come from different dimensions Therefore each dimension should be partitioned at the fuzzy set level Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


Here consider a fuzzy data cube with 3 dimensions if values of attributes x i  y j and z k have membership degrees  i m x 265   j n y 265 and  k o z 265 in fuzzy sets m i f  n j f and o k f  respectively then sr of the fuzzy sets of the corresponding cell is computed as  i m x 265   j n y 265   k o z 265 Thismaybe generalized for n dimensions So the frequency for each itemset can be directly obtained from one cell of the fuzzy cube In a way similar to the single dimension case each cell stores the product of the membership grades of different items one item per dimension As the example data cube shown in Figure 2 has three dimensions each cell stores the product of the membership grades of three items one from each of the three dimensions Finally the fuzzy support value of each cell is calculated as follows  mTotal SR FSupport   3.3 Hybrid Method This method is based on a hybrid structure which combines single and multidimensional rules without repetitive items within one dimension In this case each candidate itemset can be written as multi single hybrid LLL 000   where single L and multi L are the items from one dimension and multi-dimensions respectively The reason for using this new method is to provide the opportunity for one dimension to dominate over others This dominating dimension corresponds to the one referred to as non-transactional dimension in the single dimension method The motivation is to overcome the database size problem as follows instead of looking for all possible associations we look for rules containing specific items in a fuzzy data cube The problem is reduced into how to efficiently identify itemsets which are relevant to our data requirements and then construct association rules that satisfy our needs This way we oid sidering data d rules that do not meet the current data requirements To illustrate this consider the 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube shown in Figure 2 If the three dimensions X Y and Z are assumed to represent the transaction the dominating non-transaction and the other dimension respectively then we can obtain a rule including the triplet  y 1  y 2  z 1  with its fuzzy support calculated as Total sum fyfxFf SR FSupport Zz in only x all for n jj m ii n j Yy fy ij n jj      1   001 001 002 002 002  4 Experimental Results We performed some empirical tests in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach All of the experiments were conducted on a Pentium III 1.4GHz CPU with 512 MB of memory d running Windows 2000 As experimental data we constructed the fuzzy data cube using 10 attributes and 100K transactional records from the adult data of the United States census in 2000 0 100 200 300 400 500 12 34 56 78 910 MinimumSupport  N u m b er o f A s s o ci a t i o n R u l es 0.7 0.6 0.5 Figure 4 ct of different imum confidence lues on mining 2-dimensional fuzzy data cube 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 12345678910 Minim m Support  Nu m b e r o f As s o c i a t i o n R u l e s FS3 FS4 FS5 Figure 5 Effect of different numbers of fuzzy sets on mining 2-dimensional fuzzy data cube Three sequences of tests were arried out one for each of the three methods presented in Section 3 Each set of tests necessitates the construction of a fuzzy data cube which complies with the requirements of the method under investigation for each dimension of the cube a set of attributes was picked up from the experimental database Finally each set consists of two experiments to evaluate our approach with respect to the following dimensions 1 number of association rules generated for different values of minimum support and different minimum confidence values namely 0.5 0.6 and 0.7 and 2 number of association rules generated for different values of minimum support and different numbers of fuzzy sets namely 3 4 and 5 fuzzy sets denoted FS3 FS4 and FS5 respectively Note that in the experiments unless otherwise specified the minimum confidence and the number of fuzzy sets have been set to 0.6 and 4 respectively The first set of experiments was carried out to test the first method on a 2-dimensional fuzzy data cube with 6 attributes used to construct t he non-transaction dimension the results are shown in Figures 4 and 5 According to Figure 4 the number of the rules mined decreases as the minimum support value increases This is quite consistent with our intuition Also the curve is smoother as the minimum confidence value increases This means that the minimum support value has large effect on the number of mined rules for smaller minimum confidence values As Figure 5 is concerned larger number of fuzzy sets generates more rules for FS3 and FS4 However as the minimum support value increase the curve of FS5 drops quickly and after a particular minimum support value it generates fewer rules Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


than the others This is reasonable since a large number of fuzzy sets will easily scatter quantities of an item from different transactions in different sets In the second set of experiments we applied the second method on a 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube each dimension has 3 quantitative attributes The results are shown in Figures 6 and 7 The curves plotted in Figure 6 show the relationships between number of rules mined and minimum support values for different values of minimum confidence The numbers of association rules produced for different number of fuzzy sets are given in Figure 7 In this case each itemset of a given rule is coming from different dimensions It is worth mentioning that the same interpretation about Figures 4 and 5 is valid for Figures 6 and 7 respectively The last set of experiments is dedicated to testing the hybrid method on the same 3-dimentional fuzzy data cube used in the previous set of experiments The results are shown in Figures 8 and 9 The same interpretation for Figures 4 and 5 are also valid for Figures 8 and 9 respectively As the results obtained from all the three methods are consistent it is anticipated that our approach presented in this paper is equally effective regardless of the number of fuzzy sets utilized in the process  0 50 100 150 200 250 300 12345678910 Minimum Support  N u mb er o f A s s o ci at i o n R u l e s 0.7 0.6 0.5 Figure 6 ct of different imum confidence lues on mining 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 12345678910 m Support  N u mb er o f A s s o ci at i o n R u l e s FS3 FS4 FS5 Figure 7 Effect of different numbers of fuzzy sets on mining 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube 5 Summary and Conclusions In this paper we proposed a general architecture that utilizes a fuzzy data cube for knowledge discovery in quantitative attributes Also we presented three different methods for the online mining of fuzzy association rules from the proposed architecture One method deals with the mining of fuzzy association rules in 2-dimensional fuzzy data cube The other two methods handle the mining process in multidimensional fuzzy data cube We have already tested the last two methods on a 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube The experiments conducted on adult data of the United States census in 2000 showed that the proposed approach produces meaningful results and has reasonable efficiency 0 100 200 300 400 500 12345 678910 Minimum Support  N u m b er o f A s s o ci a t i o n R u l es 0.7 0.6 0.5 Figure 8 ct of different imum confidence lues on mining 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube for the hybrid case 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 12345678910 m Support  N u mb er o f A s s o ci at i o n R u l e s FS3 FS4 FS5 Figure 9 Effect of different numbers of fuzzy sets on mining 3-dimensional fuzzy data cube for the hybrid case ferences 1 C  C  A g a r w al and P  S  Y u 223A new a ppr o a c h t o o n l i n e generation of association rules,\224 IEEE TKDE  Vol.13 No.4 pp.527-540 2001 2 R  A g r aw al  A  G up t a  S  S a r aw ag i  223 M o d el i n g Multidimensional Databases,\224 Proc of IEEE ICDE  1997 3 K  C  C  C ha n a nd W H  A u  223 M i ni n g F u zz y A s s o ci a t i o n Rules,\224 Proc of ACM CIKM  pp.209-215 1997 4 J  H an and Y  F u  223 M i n i n g m ul t i p l el e v e l a sso c i at i o n r u l es i n rge databases,\224 IEEE TKDE  1 804 1999 5 C  H i d b e r 223 O n l in e A s s o c i a t i o n R u l e M in in g  224 Proc of ACM SIGMOD  p 145-156 1999 6 M  K am ber  J  H a n a nd J  Y  C h i a ng  223 M e t a r ul e g ui ded ning of onal ation rules using a cubes,\224 Proc of ACM KDD 210 1997 7 M  K ay a R  A l ha j j  F  P o l a t and A  A r s l a n  223E f f i c i ent Automated Mining of Fuzzy Association Rules,\224 Proc of DEXA 2002 8 D  M a r g a r i t i s  C  Fa l o ut s o s a nd S  T h r u n 223N e t C u b e  A Scalable Tool for Fast Data Mining and Compression,\224 Proc of VLDB  2001 9 W  Z hang  223 M i n i ng Fuz z y Q uant i t a t i v e A s s o c i at i o n R u l es  224 Proc of IEEE ICTAI pp.99-102 1999 Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE
