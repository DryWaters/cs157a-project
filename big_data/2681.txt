DATABASE MINING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND HOUSING EXECUTTVE Ian C Magill Mee G Tan, Sarabjot S Anand David A Bell John G Hughes Introduction In this paper we describe some work being carried out by the Database Mining Research GrouppMRG within the School of Information and 
Software Engineering at the University of Ulster Jordanstown In particular we outline how we have been investigating the use of data mining techniques on data sets from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive[NME NIHE are responsible for the management of the public sector housing stock within Northern Ireland. They are the largest such body within the European 
Union and are acknowledged as leaders within their field in the use of idonnation technology WithinNlHEthere are numerous databases muse These fBl1 into two main categories There are the day to day operational databases such as the Prawl rent accounting system and the Repairs 
maintenance management system Such databases are used both for transaction processing and management information purposes. The other main category of database in use are the various data sets used by the Research Department These are used for analysis that feeds into the formulation of policy An 
example of such a data set is the five-yearly House Condition Survey This is generated by a survey of a sample of approximately 10,000 properties across Northem Ireland. For each property up to 4,000 attributes are surveyed With such a large and growing amount of data within their organisaton NIHE are 
interested in techniques that will help them make better use of it To this end they have agreed to collaborate with the DMRG in testing the use of data mining techniques on their data It was decided in the Grst instance to use the House Condition Survey data set 
mentioned above as the target data set Several data mining techniques being explored by the DMRG are being evaluated using this data The techniques in question are algorithms for the discovery of classification and association rules We are also interested in sequential or temporal rules but OUT work on 
this is less advand Ian C Magill is employed by Kainos Software Ltd Belh Mee G Tan Sarabjot S Anand and David A Bell are with the School of Information and Software Engmeenng University of Ulster at Jordanstown Northem Ireland John G Hughes is with the Faculty of Informatics Universe of Ulster at Jordanstown Northem Ireland 


Classification Rules This involves flndmg rules that partition data into disjoint groups. For example, consider the problem of tenant placement We require rules involving neighbourhood and tenant attributes that predict the value of the attribute for length of tenure If the length of tenure attribute can take the values long average and short we might discover the following rule ifestate-type  D and retail-fkilities  nearby and public_tranport_access  god and no-of-children  0 and temnt-age  55 and tenant_car_owners  no then length-of-tenure  tong Our classification algorithm is based on an existing techique AGRA92 We are attempting some enhancements to this in the areas of performance and handlmg of noisy data Association des A moreped rule relabng items within P database is called an association rule Classification rules are a particular type of association de in which the rule has a single consequent attribute The following is an example of an association rule ifdiStriCt=BT7 and unemployed  No and car-owner  yes then heating-type  oil and prop-value  50000 andgarage=yes strength  0.91 support  0.01 Each such rule bas a strength value and a support due  The strength value specifies the validity of the rule ie the proportion of cases in which the anteadent implies the consequent  The support value is the fraction of the database to which the rule applies We have been developing two distinct algorithms for discovering association rules One approach generalises an existing so that it handles multivalued attribute types The other approach is a novel parallel technique based on the mathematical theory of evidence[A"95 


Objectives The DMRG has set itself two main objectives for its work The first objective is to devise improved data mining algorithms in particular for mining classification and association rules Some of the areas of improvement being investigated are   More efficient algorithms  Widening the scope of algoritbms  bdhg of noisy data  Incorporation of prior lmowledge into algorithms  Measures of interestingness The second objective is to evaluate our algorithms on real world data sets where real world implies  Very large databases  Databases with many tabIes many attributes and many attribute types  Noisy data missing and inaccurate data values The HCS data set fulfils the above requirements Mining Kernel System To facilitate our work on data mining algorithms we have designed and built a database mining tookit the MdKemel System or MKS MKS is a toolkit for implementing and evaluating database mining algorithms It is intended primarily as a workbench for investigating algorithms but can also be considered a research prototype for a database mining system MKS has two main features   A set of flexible components for buildmg algorithms Most algorithms have common components so we avoid duplicating effort  Flexible access to a variety of databases This allows us to work easily with any data set from a relational database The virtual view mechanism of MKS allows users to create a virtual dataspace on which to apply their data mining algoritbms The space takes the form of a relation The attributes that make up the relation can be mapped to a variety of underlying relational databases The mapping between the attributes of a view and the attributes of the underlying data source is specified in a view definition text file The view mechanism enabl any data in a relational 8/3 


database to be brought into a standard memon data structure by simply creating a view definition text file Initial results The MKS toolkit has been completed and the three algorithms described above have been imwented with its facilities Initial trials of the algorithms using thwCS data set are taking pia mith a formal data mining study scheduled to take place in February The initial mals suggest that the performance of the algorithms is reasonably linear with respact to the number of tuples processed but much less so with respect to both the number of atmbutes and the number of attribute values Also clear at this stage is the problem of imcrprctauon of the very large number uf rules that be generated ifthe algorithms are not connralncd to particular target rules Acknowledgements We wish to thank the Northern Ireland Indmtrd Research and Technology Unit for providing finand support for this WO John McPeake ad his staf\200 in the NIHE Research Department for ttretr collaboration and encouragement References AGM921 R Agrawal S Ghosh B Iyer T hielinski and A Swami An Interval Classifier for Database hhmg Applications VLDB-92 hm British Colunbia 1992,560-573 fRGFL4931 a Agrawal T hielinski A Sw Mining assochion rules between rules between sets of items in large databases Proc of the ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data Washington D.C May 1993 ANAN951 S Anand C M Shapcott D A Bell and J G Hughes Data Mining in Parallel WOTUG-18 Manchester April 1995 1995 The Institution of Electrical Engineen Printed and published by the IEE Savoy Place London WCPR OBL UK

processing elements Standard LAN technologies were also immature so that we were forced to design and implement our own interconnection networks Now that the circumstances have dramatically changed it is reasonable to use commodity PCs as processing elements and ATM technology for interconnection With ATM connected PC clusters we have only to develop software for parallel query processing So we ported the system software developed for the SDC to our PC cluster system Currently we emulate the device driver layer of the SDC code by user level threads POSIX thread on Solaris 2.5.1 operating system We are also planning kernel level implementation for maximal efficiency Figure 4 depicts the global architecture of our database server Queries issued from the user applications are compiled and optimized at the front-end machine to produce the executable code We take the compiled mode where the generated code consists of the processor\220s native code instead of the interpreted mode for efficiency and flexibility Currently however the SQL compiler and optimizer are not yet ready and the work has to be done by hand That is we determine a plan for the query and write a C code for the plan Execution of a query is initiated by the coordinator program The coordinator broadcasts the generated code to each PC node where a server process for query execution is running Figure 5 shows the structure of the server process called database kernel The database kernel consists of several permanent threads and one of such threads named the dbk server interacts with the coordinator It creates a user thread for executing the code passed from the coordinator and monitors exceptional events from the user thread or the coordinator The exceptional conditions from the user thread are reported to the coordinator and cause user threads running at other nodes to abort The generated code contains only parts specific to the corresponding query such as the initialization and finalization code according to the execution plan and evaluation code for predicates in the query Commonly used code such as hash table manipulation and various conversion routines are contained in the database kernel and are dynamically linked to the target code before its execution Each of the user threads then sets up the I/O streams and registers an operator to each input stream as a callback function Another permanent thread dispatcher keeps polling all the registered input streams and evaluates callback functions with data delivered by I/O threads for disk and network Thus most of the processing is done within the context of the dispatcher and the user thread suspends until the EOF condition is met This model of 217\217centralized I/O\220\220 is designed so as to support multiple queries running at the same time Once execution starts the PCs perform their operations without any centralized control Barrier synchronizations are encapsulated within open and close operations of network connections to simplify the code On completion of the network open operation  dbk  connect  all the nodes are guaranteed to be ready for receiving data and on completion of the network close operation  dbk shutdown  it is guaranteed that no more data will arrive 3.3 Performance evaluation using a TPC-D benchmark query TPC-D benchmark consists of 17 complex queries issued to a database which contains eight Among them the most time consuming query is the query 9 which requires five join operations Figure 6 shows SQL description of the query Here we examine the execution times of this query with different plans We generated a 100GB test database shown in table 2 using a modified version of the dbgen program and partitioned tuples of each relation horizontally over the 100 disks according to the hash values of the primary key In fact NATION and REGION are not partitioned but replicated because they are quite small We didn\220t create any indexes to force the full scan of the relations because the indexes wouldn\220t help ad-hoc queries Figure 7 depicts an execution plan of the query 9 with the right-deep tree First four hash tables are 7 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

4 Data mining 4.1 Association rule mining Data mining which is a recent hot research topic in the database field is a method of discovering useful information such as rules and previously unknown patterns existing behind data items It enables more effective utilization of transaction log data which have been just archived and abandoned Among the major applications of data mining is association rule mining so called 217\217basket analysis.\220\220 Each of the transaction data typically consists of a set of items bought in a transaction By analyzing them one can derive some association rule such as 217\21790 of the customers who buy both A and B also buy C.\220\220 In order to improve the quality of obtained rules a very large amount of transaction data have to be examined requiring quite a long time to complete First we introduce some basic concepts of association rule Let 000 000 001 000 1 001\000 2 001\002\002\002\001\000 000 002 be a set of items and 003 000 001 003 1 001\003 2 001\002\002\002\001\003 001 002 be a set of transactions where each transaction 003 002 is a set of items such that 003 002 004\000  n itemset 004 has support 005 in the transaction set 003 if 005  f transactions in 003 contain 004  here we denote 005 000 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 An association rule is an implication of the form 004 005 n  where 004\001 n 004 000  and 004 006 n 000 007  Each rule has two measures of value support and confidence  The support of the rule 004 005 n is 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002  The confidence 013 of the rule 004 005 n in the transaction set 003 means 013 of transactions in 003 that contain 004 also contain n  which can be written as 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002  For example let r 1 000 001 1 001 3 001 4 002  r 2 000 001 1 001 2 001 3 001 5 002  r 3 000 001 2 001 4 002  r 4 000 001 1 001 2 002  r 5 000 001 1 001 3 001 5 002 be the transaction database Let minimum  support and minimum confidence be 60 and 70 respectively First all itemsets that have support above the minimum support called large itemsets  are generated In this case the large itemsets are 001 1 002 001 001 2 002 001 001 3 002 001 001 1 001 3 002  Then for each large itemset 004  n association rule 004 t n 005 n 001 n 004 004 002 is derived if 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 t n 002 n minimum confidence  The results are 1 005 3 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 75 002 and 3 005 1 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 013\b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 100 002  The most well known algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm[1 We have studied several parallel algorithms for mining association based on Apriori One of these algorithms called HPA Hash Partitioned Apriori is discussed here Apriori first generates candidate itemsets and then scans the transaction database to determine whether each of the candidates satisfies the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence Using these results the next candidate itemsets are generated This continues until no itemset satisfies the minimum support and confidence The most naive parallelization of Apriori would copy the candidates over all the processing node and make each processing node scan the transaction database in parallel Although this works fine when the number of candidates is small enough to fit in the local memory of a single processing node memory space utilization efficiency of this method is very poor For large scale data mining the storage required for the candidates exceeds the available memory space of a processing node This causes memory overflow which results in significant performance degradation due to an excessive amount of extra I/Os HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among the processing nodes using a hash function as in the parallel hash join which eliminates broadcasting of all the transaction data and can reduce the comparison workload significantly Hence HPA works much better than the naive parallelization for large scale data mining The 022 th iteration pass 022  f the algorithm is as follows 1 Generate the candidate itemsets Each processing node generates new candidate itemsets from the large itemsets of the last  001 022 t 1 002 th iteration Each of the former itemsets contains 022 items while each of the latter itemsets contains 001 022 t 1 002 items They are called 022 itemsets and 001 022 t 1 002 itemsets respectively The processing node applies the hash function to each of the candidates to determine the destination node ID If the candidate is for the processing node itself it is inserted into the hash table otherwise it is discarded 13 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
