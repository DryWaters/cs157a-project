rules in synchronisms are presented in distributed transaction database environments by using meta-learning technology The algorithm has higher mining eMciency and lower data communication amount The distributed factor y is also defined in the paper which is to measure the effciency of mining algorithm and it is pointed ont that the value of y is related to mining efliciency and data communication amount Experiments have been conducted to prove the correctness and effciency of the algorithm DMAR Keywords Assodation rule Distributed mining Meta-learning technology 1 Introduction Data 
Mining is to abstract interesting and useful and implicit information or knowledge from a large amount of original data and it can be expressed as a concept a rule a pattern, etc It is a new promising research field integrated with artificial intelligence and database which has attracted a lot of scholars attention to study its methodology, theory and instrument The association rule proposed by Agrawal et al as a major part in data mining is a rule to describe a certain association relationship among a set of objects that is a set of transaction items 
in a database The mining of association rules may require iterative scanning of large transaction in database therefore the efficiency of mining is the key At present the scope of the study has been extended to incremental updating parallell distributed and sampling mining of association rules Tovienven's sampling mining of association rule 31 which contribute a lot to solve the problem of efficiency Savaser et al's a partition way to settle the restrict of memory 14 Jong's mining of association rules with adjustable accuracy aiming at validity being more important than c~mpleteness The above ways of mining can only apply 
to one machine or a single data set. David et al's a fast distributed algorithm for mining of association rules FDM but is not very efficient and its required communication amount is a little bit large Wang Chunhua et al's distributed algorithm for mining of association rules with adjustable accuracy SMDM I which is only fit for the condition in which the transaction data balanced distributed and based on the condition in which the efficiency is more important than completeness As for conditions that demand a much higher completeness this paper proposed an algorithm DMAR of distributed mining association rules by 
using meta-learning technology based on above studies That is to mine local frequent itemsets which are used as being meta knowledge at all sites respectively in the distributed transaction and to generate the candidate global frequent itemsets by these meta knowledge, then to scan transaction database once and get entire global frequent itemsets This algorithm has higher mining efficiency and requires lower communication amount and defines the distributed factor y which can measure the algorithm's efficiency and communication amount. Experiments with real supermarket transaction data as transaction data set prove that the algorithm is correct and effective 2 Problem definition 2.1 Association

Proceedings of the First International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Beijing 4-5 November 2002 being globally frequent itemsets and it shows that the data in DB are distributed more balanced at all sites, the smaller and the less 5 When the number of sites varies using the table of frequent itemsets we can realize fast updating mining of association rules. For example while deleting a site i we only need to set the support account of the Si column in the table of frequent itemsets as zero and recalculate the value of S and 0 then we can get the globally frequent itemsets while adding a site we only need to add one column to register the support count of locally frequent itemsets at the site If the locally freqnent,itemsets at the site is a new itemsets added in the table of frequent itemsets, we can use the new-added itemsets to scan the other sites once then we can get the support count of the itemsets, recount the value of S and 0 then get the set of globally freqnent itemsets 5.2 Comparison between DMAR and other related algorithms 1 Completeness Both the algorithm DMAR and FDM can mine out the entire frequent itemsets, but SMDM only can get the approximate frequent itemsets 2 Communication To mine out the set of globally k freqnent itemsets in every iterative step the algorithm FDM need to exchange the support connt of the set of candidate k frequent itemsets and the locally itemsets which results in a large amount and great frequency of communication and complicated communication protocol Differently algorithm DMAR transits and registers the set of locally frequent itemsets through step 3 in algorithm after mining the set of locally frequent itemsets at any site respectively with once communication at step 7 and step \(lO\the communication data is a set of candidate frequent itemsets getting at each site from the table of frequent itemsets Therefore algorithm DMAR has less frequency \(only three times and small amount of communication the set of locally freqnent itemsets and the non-freqnent itemsets in candidate global frequent itemsets at any site and the support connt of them 3 Mining efficiency AU the sites must be synchronously waiting for collecting the support counts of the candidate frequent iternsets at the other sites at the end of every iterative step in algorithm FDM While the mining process at any site in algorithm DMAR is independent and sometimes can be off-line with the small amount of communication Therefore the mining efficiency of algorithm DMAR is higher than that of FDM 6 Experiment analysis Based on the tool pale Visual Basic at PentiumiV-1.4G CPU 128M memory store and on the operation system Windows 2000 we made experiments using the real set of transaction itemsets of some supermarket for one month as transaction data set there are 69231 transaction records and 15169 pieces of merchandise these commodities are divided into three levels: the lowest is the 15169 pieces of commodities, the second is 228 kinds of ware the fiat level has 20 sets The experiment is processed in 69231 transaction itemsets based on 228 items that is lIl=228 IDBk69231 and the mining algorithm in the experiment is Apriori The mining made by one machine The other way of mining is the distributed mining using three sites named as sl s2 s3 under Windows 2000 LAN environment and the number of transaction records are 23000 23000 23231 respectively The result of the experiment is figured as follows iig.1 Fig.\(a describes the execution time of one machine mining and distributed mining DMAR under different minimum support And the result is same that is the two different ways of mining have the completely same frequent itemsets and its support so the experiment sufficiently manifested that the algorithm DMAR is correct and effective as well for it ItDMAR One machine 1 12  e 8 m  4 w 2 0 B h lo 216  x I Speedup ratio 1 0  2 5 E.SIW 00  Minimum support   Distributed factor 1  Fig.1 The result of experiment Fig.@\describes the ratio of one machine mining time and distributed mining time DMAR under different minimum support that is speedup ratio From the experiment we discovered that several factors influencing speedup ratio 1 pruning time It is related to transaction itemsets and minimum support under the same minimum support, the more transaction itemsets, the more amount of 2034 


Proceedtngs of the Fust International Conference on Machme Lemg and Cybernehcs Beqmg 4-5 November 2002 2035 itemsets joining together so the pruning time will be longer while the same transaction itemsets the less minimum support the more the amount of produced k-frequent itemsets and the amount of joining k+l itemsets will be more, then the pruning time will be longer too At the same time it manifests that the pruning time and the number of the itemsets needing.to mining have no direct relationship while being the same transaction itemsets and minimum support, the effect of pruning to the final efficiency will be more bigger with the amount of transaction itemsets decreasing. Since the amount of transaction itemsets at each site in distributed mining is less than that of one machine and the transaction itamsets and minimum support relatively keep same the pruning time\222will have more influence on the efficiency of distributed mining.\(Z The data balanced degree at each site the balanced degree of the transaction data at each site affects the waiting time among sites and the number of itemsets as meta knowledge contained in the table of frequent itemset 221The less balanced transaction data at each site the longer waiting time among sites and the more number of itemsets contained in meta knowledge at each si@; as a result at the corresponding site the longer time counting the support count of itemsets contained in,meta knowledge which degrades the efficiency 3 Data communication it is related to minimum support and the balanced degree of transaction data at each site The smaller minimum support is the more amount of locally frequent itemsets mined out at each site the bigger amount of communication we need to tilling locally frequent itemsets into the table of frequent itemsets the less balanced degree of transaction data at each site is the more itemsets are contained in meta knowledge, the bigger amount of communication we need therefore the efficiency of distributed mining is lower Fig.\(c describes distributed factors under different minimum support, the bigger minimum support the smaller amount of communication and the higher efficiency corresponding the bigger value of distributed factory 7 Conclusions In this paper to meet the higher desirable completeness we presented mining association rules using meta-leaming technology and correspondingly algorithm DMAR by scanning twice the set of data at each site The algorithm DMAR is to mine the set of locally frequent itemsets being meta knowledge respectively at each site which is used to collect all the candidate globally frequent itemsets then after scanning transaction data set once the entire globally frequent itemsets can be produced The algorithm has some merits such as higher efficiency lower amount of communication and being unrelated with whether the transaction data being balanced It defines the distributed factor y measuring the algorithm\222s efficiency and indicates the relationship between y and the communication the algorithm\222s efficiency In the end using really supermarket transaction data as transaction data set we proved by experiments tbat the algorithm is correct and effective Acknowledgements Natural sciences grants item of Sbanxi Province Referenca l Agrawal R hielinski T Mining association rules between sets of items in large database In hoc of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD conf on Management of data New York 1993907-216 2 Agrawal R Fast algorithms for mining association rules In proceedings of the 20th ICVLD\2221994 Santiago Chile 487-499 3 Toivonen H Sampling large database for mining of association rules In proceedings of the 22th ICVLD\2221996 Bombay India 1-12 4 Savasere A,Omiecinski E An efficient algorithm for mining association rules in large database In proc of 21th int conf on Very Large Data Base Swizerland 51 Park J S Yu P S Mining association rules with adjustable accuracy 1n:Roc of the fourth Int conf on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining New York 1998 6 Cheung D W Han Jiawei Fast distributed algorithm for mining association rules 1n:Proc of Int\222l conf On Parallel and Distributed Information Systems  Florida 71 Wang Chunhua Distributed Mining Adjustable Accuracy Association Rules Using Sampling In Journal of computer research  development 2000,37\(9\1101-1106 8 Feng Yucai Incremental Updating Algorithms for Mining Association Rules In Journal of software 1998 Y\(4 301-306 191 Bang Jifu Updating Association Rule based on dynamic Transaction Item Set In Computer Engineering, 2000,26\(7 64-65 IO Hu Kan Large Data Warehouse-based Data Mining a Survey In Journal of Software 1998,9\(1 53-63 1995:432-444 1998 31-44 


documents are processed Each term in the query is weighted according to a function of its actual frequency in the corpus. Both the query and the documents are seen as vectors and the cosine of the two vectors is computed The query expansion module uses alternatively one of the term relation either constructed by the association rule miner or from WordNet we translated the main WordNet relations into terms and stored them into Oracle 5 Experimental results In the experiments each query and document is treated as a vector in the space of terms We compute the cosine value of the query and each document to measure the similarity between them See the formula in section 3.1 The query terms are weighted using the method mentioned in the same section After the cosine value of each document computed they are ranked by their value in descend order Using this ranked list we compute precision value at recall point from 0.1 to 1 O Take query 202 for example it has 52 relevant documents So the recall point 0.1 means the point of the first 5 relevant documents are retrieved say it\222s the nth document Then the precision is 5111 The graphs below show the average precision of each recall point among the 48 topics The higher the corresponding plots the more effective the retrieval 5.1 Query Expansion using WordNet Average precision using expansion methOd\(W0rdrlet Noexpansim  Expansion with Wordhlet\(H pernym x  Expansion wim Wmme*\(Jynmym   Expanson wlthWordNet\(Hypmym  U I 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 1 Recall Figure 5 If we use the WordNet associations to expand the query we do not observe consistent improvement Figure 5 shows the effectiveness of the expanded query in comparison to the initial query The random performance has numerous causes one important one being the fact that the general thesaurus although semantically ideal may not reflect the vocabulary jargon and usage within the corpus The 223SALT-I\224 and 223SALT-11\224 are examples of this kind Expansion with Hypernym or Synonym changes the performance little But expansion with Hyponym hurts the performance much It\222s because Hyponyms are narrower meaning words of the query terms A query term might be expanded with many of it\222s specific meaning words which are not related to the query An example is term \223status\224 in topic 202, which is \223Status of nuclear proliferation treaties  violations and monitoring\224 There are 146 kinds of 223status\224 such as 223safe\224 223danger\224 etc Many of them are not relevant to the topic 5.2 Query Expansion using Association Rules Q=>X No expansron t g 0.2  0.15 0.1 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Recall Figure 6 Figure 6 shows the performance of expansion with terms implied by the query terms When using the association rules we need set a low-bound of support Rules with support below this bound are thought appear by casual We select rules whose support is bigger than 0.001 That means the query word and expanded words co-occurred in at least 0.1 of the documents Since the AP90 is topic diverse, this support is not low The parameters are chosen by hand, but it\222s applied to all 48 queries This method improves the first 4 recall points and degrades a little in the rest In real retrieval system users focus on the former ones They wish a good quality in high ranked documents rather than the overall performance We have eliminated the stop words when created the inverted index. But there are still some words appear in too many documents in the corpus. A typical example is the word 221report\222 It\222s often in the news but not a common stop word In AP90 it appeared in30,302 out of 78,321 documents These words are noise and will hurt the retrieval so we tried to set a high-bound for the support of expanded words The performance is shown in Figure 7 371

However the tuning of the main parameters for the selection of the rules the ranges of the support and the confidence was done in a non-systematic way due to the duration of each experiment Such a running is possible with association rules since they add more control parameters confidence and direction to the previously proposed methods based on the sole term co-occurrence Encouraged by these preliminary results yielding a rare performance increase of up to 5 we are now embarking on the systematic evaluation of the influence of the parameters 6.2 Polysemy and Disambiguation An important property of words and terms is their ability to have several concurrent meaning This maybe undesirable feature is called polysemy The term 223Java\224 for instance can refer to the popular programming language the popular coffee, which gave its name to the programming language or the popular tourist destination, which gave its name to the coffee In a query 223Development programs in the island of java\224 only the co-occurrence of the terms 223island\224 and 223java\224 which happen to have a direct hypernym relation in this case can help resolve the ambiguity which is unfortunately reinforced by the terms 223program\224 and 223development\224 We would like to study the opportunity for such disambiguation using direct or indirect relations from mined term associations This could potentially help prevent the expansion to words like 223soyabean\224 in queries of the form 223nuclear plant\224 Indeed the general form of association rules can be t   tk  tL    t 6.3 Multi Lingual Applications Finally a next objective of this research is to mine term associations for corpus written in languages for which Thesaurus such as WordNet are not readily available or too expensive We wish to study text information retrieval and query expansion for languages such as Malay/Indonesian and Mandarin with respectively two hundred and twenty million and one billion native speakers joining the information society References 131 Ellen M Voorhees and Yuan-Wane Hou 223Vector Expansion in a Large Collection First Text REtrieval Conference TREC-I 1993 4 R.Richardson A.F.Smeaton and J.Murphy 223Using WordNet as a Knowledge Base for Measuring Semantic Similarity between Words 222\222 5 E.M.Voorhees 223Query Expansion using Lexical-Semantic Relations 224 ACM-SIGIR 1994 6 W.R.Greiff 223A Theory of Term Weighting Based on Exploratory Data Analysis\224 ACM SIGIR. 1998 7 S.H Lin C.S Shih M.C Chen J.M Ho M.T KO and Y.M Huang 223Extracting Classification Knowledge of Internet Documents with Mining Term Associations A Semantic Approach 224 ACM SIGIR 1998 8 M.Sanderson and B.Crofi 223Deriving Concept Hierarcbies from Text 224 ACM SIGIR, 1999 9 Agrawal R Imielinski T and Swami A 223Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases 224 Procedings ofthe ACM SIGMOD, 1996 IO EuroWordnet 223Building a Multilingual Database with Wordnets for several European Languages 223 littp:/l~~.wM;.lium.u\\;a.nl/-cwn I I Wordnet 223 WordNet  a Lexical Database for English 222 httn:iiM:\\y\\v.cogsci princeton.ed ti-wn I21 W Greif 223A Theory of Term Weighting Based on Exploratory Data Analysis 224 ACM SIGIR 1998  131 R Baeza-Yates B Ribeiro-Neto 223Modem Information Retrieval.\224 1999 I41 J.Wei Z.Qin S.Bressan and BC.Ooi 223Mining Term Association Rules for Global Query Expansion A Case Study with Topic 202 from TREC4\224 Information Systems 2000 Americas Conference 2000  I51 S.Jones K and Bates 223Research on automatic indexing 1974-1976.\224 Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge 1977 I A.F Smeaton and I.Quigley 223Experiments on Using Semantic Distances Between Words in Image Caption Retrieval 224 Intemational Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval 1996 2 G.A.Miller R.Beckwith C.Felbaum D.Gross and K.Miller 223lntroduction to WordNet An On-line Lexical Database 224 Revised Version 1993 373

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
