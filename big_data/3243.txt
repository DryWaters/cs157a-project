value measures, support and confidence, denoted by sup\(R and conf\(R\an item set, X, has support, s, in transaction set, D, if s% of transaction in D contain X. Then  Y X Y X R sup  sup   X Y X Y X R conf sup  sup  Different transactions may contain same itemset especially for remote sensed imagery. This suggests a way to eliminate duplicate calculation. Some concepts are given below Let U = {t’| t’ is any possible transaction}, while D = {t| t is a transaction already happened Definition 2.1 A pattern, p, is a non-empty itemset. A transaction pattern, is a pattern that belongs to transaction P D is all transaction pattern set D t t Iternset t P D    Each transaction has a transaction pattern. Different transactions may have same pattern Definition 2.2 A possible pattern, is a pattern of possible transaction. P U is the set of all possible patterns U t t Iternset t P U      Let be the superset of I, so   2   I Lemma 2.3           U D D P P D P Definition 2.4 The occurrence of a transaction pattern p, is the number of transactions whose itemset is p i.e occur \(p D, t.Itemset = p } | = |D|*sup\(p For market basket data mining, any itemset can be a customer’s transaction. So |P U  In this case, two different transactions rarely have the same transaction pattern, i.e. |P D  D|. However, in multiband satellitic image data, each transaction \(pixel\e number of items which is the number of bands, different pixels may have different reflectance values, but after partition, they may belong to the same interval for all the bands respectively and share the same transaction pattern. So, for multiband satellitic image data we usually have |P U    P D D Example 2.5 Multiband satellitic images are large For example, TM images cover about 170 kilometers square and there are about 6500 rows of pixels and 6500 columns of pixels tota ling about 40,000,000 pixels Suppose we are Green 3\(Blue 4\(Yield\Each pixel has a reflectance value within 0 256} for each band.

The approach is based on transaction patterns and occurrence counting. The following are the advantages of this approach It simplifies the counting of support It avoids scanning over the entire transaction database each time in generating frequent k-itemsets It makes rule generation much faster It’s especially useful for multiband satellitic image With this approach, mining association rules on remotely sensed data will be much easier, faster and more practical ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is supported by the Project on Science Research Program of the Hubei Provincial Department of Education in China D20081507  REFERENCES  R.

Table 10 Overview of different error classes in DC1 Algorithm All Features Multi-word features Single-word features False negatives False positives False negatives False positives None of the terms extracted Some of the terms extracted All extracted but not combined On-topic features Off-topic features Not extracted Extracted falsely as multi-word On-topic features Off-topic features Association Mining 594 14 62 25 23 0 45 39 260 259 Likelihood Test 594 138 1 0 1 0 295 3 29 0 002ed the algorithm in order to consider only the subsequence of the extracted feature which consists of nouns We refer to these two modi\002cations as Subsequence Similarity SsS An evaluation of these modi\002cations is shown in columns 5 and 6 of Table 7 We observe an average increase of recall by 2 and an increase of precision by 10 4.3.2 Analysis of the Association Mining Approach The precision of the Association Mining approach is fairly low since it returns any noun as a feature if it often occurs in the documents For example the term week is extracted as a frequent feature There is no distinction between dataset speci\002c terms and common vocabulary terms Setting the minimum-support threshold higher will not solve this problem as it would lead to decreased recall Note that in our evaluation Table 8 the infrequent features hardly affect the algorithm's results since they are only very seldomly extracted at all For example in the DC1 dataset of the 597 sentences only 12 contain an opinion word but no frequent feature Of those 12 cases the infrequent feature identi\002cation leads to 7 correct and 5 false features being extracted In some cases see Column 9 of Table 10 the association mining falsely attributes nouns occurring in a sentence to a single feature set For example in 4 recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available g3 is extracted as a feature set since the two terms occur together as one entity in multiple other sentences The compactness pruning will therefore not remove this feature set Sentences as 4 will hence result in an error during extraction The large amount of false positives in the single-word feature extraction see Table 10 Columns 6  7 is due to the fact that many sentences in the DC1 dataset consist of comparisons of the DC1 camera to other camera models The features of these other camera models are also mentioned in the reviews and therefore falsely extracted by the association mining since the algorithm is not capable of distinguishing between references to features of the DC1 camera and any other camera model 4.3.3 Comparison of the Approaches As outlined in Table 10 the two approaches have their strengths and weaknesses in different tasks If the Likelihood Ratio Test approach fails to extract a multi-word feature the tendency is that none of the feature terms are being extracted while this is not the case in the association mining approch This is due to the fact that the association mining algorithm will return any feature combination occurring in a given sentence while the Likelihood Ratio Test approach requires that a multi-word feature occurs in the same ordering in several sentences in order to achieve a high likelihood ratio and therefore be extracted The threshold of the Likelihood Ratio Test approach in combination with the Subsequence similarity calculation will therefore prevent that a subset of a multi-word feature is extracted instead the feature will not be extracted at all At the same time the association mining extracts several false multi-word features none of them belonging to the general vocabulary We observe similar results in the analysis of the single-word errors The Likelihood Ratio Test approach fails to extract many of the features which is again due to the threshold while the Association Mining approach extracts less false features but has the problem of wrongly extracting actual single-word features as a multi-word expression as analyzed in Section 4.3.2 The inability of the Association Mining approach to recognize whether a certain candidate feature is an attribute of the current topic as de\002ned in Section 2.1 is observable in Columns 10  11 of Table 10 The Association Mining approach extracts a large number of false features compared to the Likelihood Ratio Test approach The low number of falsely extracted on-topic features of the Likelihood Ratio Test approach could be attributed to the dBNP method Apparently if a candidate BNP is preceded by a de\002nite article an on-topic feature follows However the low number of false positives during the feature extraction re\003ects the tradeoff between recall and precision of this approach 5 Conclusions In this paper we provide a comprehensive analysis of two state-of-the-art algorithms for extracting features from product reviews based on the Likelihood Ratio Test and on

association mining The Likelihood Ratio Test fails to extract features also belonging to common vocabulary and it makes the extraction dependent on the feature position in the sentence leading to low recall The dBNP and bBNP based methods yield low recall due to the fact that the product features do not occur with the article the in front of them very often The Association Mining approach returns all frequent nouns which decreases precision Our results suggest that the choice of algorithm to use depends on the targeted dataset If it consists of mainly on-topic content the results of Table 10 indicate that the Association Mining algorithm is better suited for this task due to its high recall If the dataset consists of a mixture of onand off-topic content our results suggest that the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm would perform better due to its ability to distinguish and 002lter out the off-topic features For future work we plan to extend the Likelihood Ratio Test methods especially the dBNP based approach by other determiners such as a or this  which should increase the recall of this method Another possibility which we will investigate regards the BNP patterns The current Likelihood Ratio Test approach is not capable of dealing with discontinuous feature phrases for example in 5 the quality of the pictures is great the feature would be picture quality  This problem could be addressed by introducing wildcards in the BNP patterns We will also investigate whether there are any methods in order to calculate an optimal threshold for the candidate feature extraction in order to increase the recall of the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm We plan to investigate whether a deeper linguistic analysis e.g with a dependency parser can improve the feature

a frequency constraint and according to the structure of the dataset These proposals are all based on a global analytical model i.e an interesting approach that needs however to develop complex and speci\036c models As a result they cannot be easily extended to handle complex conjunctions of constraints to incorporate different symbol distributions or different semantics for pattern occurrences To the best of our knowledge no method has been proposed to estimate the number of patterns satisfying a constraint while avoiding to develop a global analytical model Our approach requires only to know how to compute for a given pattern its probability to satisfy the constraint this can be obtained in many situations and it remains ef\036cient in practice by adopting a pattern space sampling scheme 6 Conclusion Using constraints to specify subjective interestingness issues and to support actionable pattern discovery has become popular Constraint-based mining techniques are now well studied for many pattern domains but one of the bottlenecks for using them within Knowledge Discovery processes is the extraction parameter tuning This is especially true in the context of differential mining where domain knowledge is used to provide different datasets to support the search of truly interesting patterns From a user perspective a simple approach would be to get graphics that depict the extraction landscape i.e the number of extracted patterns for many points in the parameter space We developed an ef\036cient technique based on pattern space sampling that provides an estimate on the number of extracted patterns This has been applied to non trivial substring pattern mining tasks and we demonstrated by means of many experiments that the technique is effective It provides reasonable estimates given execution times that enable to probe a large number of points in the parameter space Notice that domain knowledge is also exploited here when selecting the distribution model Future directions of work include to adapt the approach to other pattern domains and to different constraints Another interesting aspect to investigate is the use of more sophisticated sampling schemes e.g that could b e incorporated in the approach when more complex syntactical constraints are handled e.g a grammar to specify the shape of the patterns Acknowledgments This work is partly funded by EU contract IQ FP6-516169 Inductive Queries for Mining Patterns and Models and by the French contract ANR-MDCO14 Bingo2 Knowledge Discovery For and By Inductive Queries We thank Dr Olivier Gandrillon from the Center for Molecular and Cellular Genetics CNRS UMR 5534 who provided the DNA promoter sequences References  J F  Boulicaut L De Raedt and H  M annila e ditors Constraint-Based Mining and Inductive Databases  volume 3848 of LNCS  Springer 2005  C  B resson C K e ime C F a ure Y  Letrillard M  B arbado S San\036lippo N Benhra O Gandrillon and S GoninGiraud Large-scale analysis by SAGE revealed new mechanisms of v-erba oncogene action BMC Genomics  8\(390 2007  L  C ao and C  Z hang Domain-dri v e n actionable kno wledge discovery in the real world In Proceedings PAKDDÕ06 volume 3918 of LNCS  pages 821–830 Springer 2006  G  D ong and J  L i Ef 036cient mining of emer ging patterns discovering trends and differences In Proceedings ACM SIGKDDÕ99  pages 43–52 1999  F  Geerts B  G oethals and J  V  d en Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans on Database Systems  30\(2 2005  U  K eich and P  A  P e vzner  S ubtle motifs de\036ning the limits of motif 036nding algorithms Bioinformatics  18\(10 2002  S  K ramer  L De Raedt and C  Helma M olecular f eature mining in HIV data In Proceedings KDDÕ01  pages 136 143 2001  L  L hote F  Rioult and A  S oulet A v e rage number of frequent closed patterns in bernouilli and markovian databases In Proceedings IEEE ICDMÕ05  pages 713–716 2005  I  M itasiunaite a nd J.-F  B oulicaut Looking for monotonicity properties of a similarity constraint on sequences In Proceedings of ACM SACÕ06 Data Mining  pages 546–552 2006  I Mitasiunaite and J F  Boulicaut Introducing s oftness i nto inductive queries on string databases In Databases and Information Systems IV  pages 117–132 IOS Press 2007  I Mitasiunaite C Rigotti S Schicklin L  M e yniel J F  Boulicaut and O Gandrillon Extracting signature motifs from promoter sets of differentially expressed genes Technical report LIRIS CNRS UMR 5205 INSA Lyon France 2008 23 pages Submitted  G Ramesh W  M aniatty  a nd M J Zaki F easible itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proceedings ACM PODSÕ03  pages 284–295 2003  F  Zelezn  y Ef\036cient sampling in relational feature spaces In Proceedings ILPÕ05  volume 3625 of LNCS  pages 397 413 Springer 2005
