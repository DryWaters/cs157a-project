Research and Application of Data Mining Technology in Scientific Research Statistics and Decision system Bingjiang Gong, Jianmei Tian College of Information and Electrical Engineering Hebei University of Engineering Handan, Hebei, China gongbingjiang@163.com Bin Chen State Grid Langfang, Hebei, China Tianjianmei0330@163.com Abstract According to the management needs for scientific research projects ,this paper propose a framework that combines data warehouse as the basis, OLAP, association rule, and apply it into the projects analysis of Science and Technology Bureau in 
Handan City. As a practical implementation of the framework the Handan City Science and Technology Plan Project Implementation Survey System was developed. The system provided the administrator an convenient and effective data analysis envioronment and generated statistical reports which describes the execution status, distribution and trend of the projects in the form of summarizing table, broken line chart, pie chart and histogram. It performed refinement from multiple aspects such as annual projects distribution, funds, workload number of the staff, benefits to provide management and decision-making related information to guide scientific research 
project Keywords-data mining; data warehouse; OLAP; associative rules I I NTRODUCTION With the continuous improvement on the level of research management, the scientific research administrative personnel hope that they can in conduct the scientific research and the policy-making support management on the basis of the existing mass data analysis. However, these data, involving a larger perspective, are voluminous, the present Event-driven database is difficult to achieve information synthesis and comprehensive flexible, multi-angle analysis on a large amounts of data, thus 
do not have decision-making support capability. In order to more effectively make use of each scientific research project to take scientific and technological development goals, scientific research management decision-makers carry on statistical analysis frequently on the benefit from the project, including the ability to train professional and technical personnel, the inputs and outputs funding inputs and outputs, the comparative analysis on the execution and completion process of the project the comparative analysis ,etc. In order to solve the actual problems encountered in the process of benefit analysis and the 
policy-making support, this article proposed a framework that combines data warehouse, associated data mining and the OLAP technology, and constructed the Handan City Science and Technology Plan Project Implementation Survey System II GENERAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE  SYSTEM This system take the data warehouse as the foundation OLAP multidimensional analysis as a means, and the associative rules to carry on data mining. Users may act according to the demand to extract data from the progress of the data warehouse, analyze the project progress, dig out useful 
information with associative rule for decision support, then demonstrate the result in the front end of the user interface. as shown in Fig1. The hierarchy system is divided into four layers data source layer, data storage layer, data processing layer, and data demonstration layer Data source layer: the basis of the data warehouse on which users extract the required information for refining, cleaning and conversion so as to load into the data marts Data storage layer: After effective integration the previously cleaned data, organize the result by the subject in 
order to carry on multidimensional analysis and data mining Data Processing Layer: with inquiry sentences the OLAP server extract data sets required by data warehouse and carry on multidimensional data analysis in it. Data mining extracted the useful knowledge from the data warehouse using association rules Data demonstration layer: namely the user interface. The OLAP front end analysis system demonstrate the results in visualized form, such as tables and graphics. Data mining helps decision-makers find potential linkage between data sets to 
support tendency prediction and decision-making III T HE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OLAP A Design of Multidimensional Data Mode Data model is a typical form of data structure, and a recognition of the real-world from a different extraction level Different data model of extraction level can be established from the real world through step by step abstraction, refinement

  The aim of the data model design is to visualize the organizational structure and the relationship of the data in an intuitive way, which will be served as the basis for further design and impmentation, hence get the specific data structure of the system, and form the system framework. Though the data warehouse fact tables and dimension tables are organized according to the analysis subject, they are still stored in the form of two-dimensional table in a relational database. In order to facilitate the OLAP multidimensional analysis, OLAP tools are used to create multi-dimensional data sets, then carry on multi-dimensional processing to data warehouse's data, and present to the front end user in an easy to understand form In order to get the multi-dimensional data set  to be used in the OLAP analysis in Handan City Science and Technology Plan Project Implementation Survey System, several aspects needs to take into consideration, including  theme analysis logistic model design, metric standard and processing method 1 theme Analysis Multi-dimensional data sets are also subject oriented, the same as the data warehouse. In this step analysis theme should be pre-determined, then carry on explicit description for each subject domain. The original database contains two correlated crossing themes, the basic project information theme and the project progress information theme. As the core of the system is to implement management of these projects, when issuing multi-dimensional data model design work will be carried on around project progress theme to establish fact tables 2 Logical model design The logistic model directly reflect business department’s requirements and plays an major Data storage layer Data analysis layer Data display layer Project schedule The Handan City Science and Technology Plan Project Implementation Survey System Progress database Handan scientific research project management system project application project and project leader database association rules mining User Interface Extracting 001 Transforming and Loading data request data wrap OLAP data analysis Provide an analysis model verification provide data Data Source Layer Extracting 001 Transforming and Loading provide data data wrap data request data mart Project Schedule Data Warehouse Figure 1 The structure of system Figure2.

  role for system implementation, is an important step in the process of data warehouse implementation. This system's logistic employs star model, the structure characteristics of star which is: in the center is a big and redundancy free fact table that is used to store dimension table foreign key and metric value for each dimension; around which is a small group of affiliated table, called dimensiontable which is an entity of record an organization wants and contains dimension levels and member types etc. Each dimension use at least a table to hold its metadata. Dimension tables appear on the rays scattered from the fact table, like the outburst of stars. That’s why stars mode bears its name. The system logic model is shown in Figure 2 3 metrics value The metrics value refers to the columns of data that is used as an indicator to reflect  one aspect of the multi-dimension data sets, and is the key data when the enduser browsing multi-dimensional data. Metric values of  the multi-dimensional data sets can be obtained through simple process by data warehouse or obtained from the computation result of other metrics value 4 processing method When the construction of storage structure of the multi-dimensional data sets is finished, no data was actually put in and needs to be processed. The processing process begins when the data is transferred from the data source to data warehouse. After aggregation calculation the results are stored in the multi-dimensional data set. When issuing analysis and query the user only needs to read the processed data from the MSOLAP server rather than extract the unprocessed data from data warehouse B OLAP analysis The OLAP analysis is mainly focused on analysis, such as slicing, dicing, drilling, and rotation on  the multi-dimensional data. Slicing refers to concentrate to observe data in two dimensions. Dicing refers to choose certain dimensions\(3 usually\ to carry on analysis. Drill-down refers to observe multi-dimensional data from the synthesized data on a higher level dimension to the detailed data on a lower level dimension Drill-up refer to carry on aggregation analysis from detailed data to synthesized data. Rotation refers to change the location relationship between dimensions to facilitate user to observe data from another perspective. After the OLAP analysis users can observe the data from multiple dimensions, multiple perspectives, and multiple aggregative degrees as to find the rules hidden behind the data IV T HE IMPLEMENTATION OF M INING A SSOCIATION R ULES A LGORITHM The association rule describes the knowledge pattern of rules that appears simultaneously in a transaction between the event, therefore association rules can be employed to spot the connection pattern hidden in the scientific research data attribute. The most classical connection rule algorithm is the Apriori algorithm which is proposed by R.Agrawal, Imielinski and Swam etc. support coefficient and confidence coefficient are two important concepts used to describe association rules the former used to measure significance of association rules in the whole data set, the latter used to measure the credibility of the association rules. The classical Apriori algorithm carries on full pruning to the item set, and only calculate the support coefficient of the candidate item set which are greater than or equal to the minimum support coefficient. However, with k increases, the length of each candidate item in Ck also increases correspondingly, but the support coefficient decrease,and the Apriori algorithm have to scan the whole database to carry on support coefficient computation thus waste a lot of time. Therefore, improved algorithm is proposed in this excavation. Ideas of the improved algorithm is as follows  Corollary 1: Any item set in C k must be a superset of some item set in C k-1  Corollary 2: If the number of item set in a transaction that contains C k-1 is less than k, then delete\( or ignore the transaction has no effect on the calculation of L j j>=k According to the above deduction, Given that the scale of item set remains the same, we use Lk, Ck to select the database thus reduced the times searching for the record in the database finally improved the efficiency of the algorithm. The main idea of adapted Apriori algorithm is to delete  transactions that do not contain any item set of Ck+1 at the link stage when produces Ck+1 initially. There is no need to carry on support .coefficient computation, so the record number related with support coefficient calculation for the candidate item set is less than that in the original database, thus increased the algorithm efficiency at last This paper take the researchers’ workload, the finished scientific and technological papers and reports, and the completion level of the project as an example to describe the complete process of association rules. Summarized according to the actual situation of the system, the results is shown in Table 1 According to the distributed characteristic of the attribute data ,carry on the discretization and integraliztion on the attribute value, and finally represented as boolean value. For convenience, researchers’ workload attribute is simplified as G the number of scientific and technological papers and reports is simplified as W, and use P to stand for completion level of the project, for short The separated and integeralized data sheet are shown in Table 2. Here, the attribute values can be transformed into yes or no boolean variables of association rules. For example, G1 stands for the workload of G is at level1, W2 stands for the TABLE I SCHEDULE OF SAMPLES Workload Project No Papers/Reports Completion level 20090141 550 4 73 20090142 523 3 86 20090143 374 6 94 20090144 235 0 77

  number of scientific and technological papers and reports is at level 2, P3 stands for the completion level of the project is at level 3, and so on. The boolean value result is shown in Table2 Use the connection rule generation algorithm, and trace the implementation process given Minconfidence=0.85. We get two strong association rules we interested in  G4 000 B3}         confidence=0.84  G3G2 000 P1 000\003 confidence=0.882 We used interest measurement method to measure interest degree for the above strong association rule, and the results is shown in Table 3 000\003 What can be seen in Table 4 is the probability that G’s occurrence causes W’s occurrence increases, that is G’s occurrence plays an positive role on W’s occurrence. so G 000 W rule can be used as knowledge to provide to the policymaker A CKNOWLEDGMENT This paper closely combined OLAP and data mining based on data warehouse and give the implementation process. The data mining provided certain analysis pattern for OLAP, in turn OLAP carried on technological verification on the data mining results. The four layers of structures based scientific research statistics and the decision-making management system can take mid-term examination on the execution details of the scientific research projects; reflect and manage the funds usage expenditures, personnel, schedule, results and effectiveness of the program execution in scientific research projects; find out the existing problems and propose a reasonable solution; thus achieves the goal of optimizing configuration of project resources and get the best desired results. In addition, it also provides positive decision support functions. It built multiple data models from multiple perspectives, multiple levels and enormous data to lay a basis for administrative personnel to perform decision analysis, evaluate scientific research units guide projects determination, balance talented person distribution, determine where and how much funds should be used R EFERENCES 1 Y o n g j un L i  C h e n  Y u  a nd Z h i q i P e ng   003\014 Relationship of Data Warehouse,OLAP and Data Mining 003\015 Science & Technology of Baotou steel\(Group\orporation 9 vol. 31, No. 5, October 2005 2 Y a l i  Li   D e si gn a n d I m p l e m e n t a t i on of O L A P  D e c i si on S u ppor t  System,"Journal of Baoji University of Arts and Sciences \(Natural Science\ ,Vol. 29 ,No. 2 ,pp. 67-71 ,June 2009 3 B om i ng G uo  We i j i L v The  D a t a M i ni ng  Te c h nol o g y  A ppl i c a t i o n  i n University's Scientific Research Management,"Science Technology and Industry,Vol.7, No.6,June 2007 4 S ho ut a o  L v Y u m i ng M a o   A pl i c a t i on of m u l t i d i m e n s i o n a l a s so c i a t i o n rules mining in undergraduate employment in universities," Information Technologe,No.10,October 2007 5 H a i y a n H u a n g,X i n  L i u   M e t h od of a ssoc i a t i o n r u l e s  I n D a t a  Mining,"Software Guide,Vol.8 No.5 May 2009 6 Y un Z h a n g   R e s e a rc h  i n D a t a  M i ni ng Te c h n o l o gy   S o ft w a r e  Guide,Vol.8 No.9,September 2009 Association rule Support Confidence Lift 15.2 86 0.486 G4 000 B3 G3G2 000 P1 24 89.5 0.59 Project No G1 G2 G3 G4 G5 W1 W2 W3 P1 P2 P3 20090141 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 20090142 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 20090143 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 20090144 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1             TABLE II ANALYSI TABLE OF INTEREST DEGREE AFTER EXCAVATION OPERATION TABLE III SAMPLES AFTER BOOLEAN PROCESSING

Stating Common users as audience will reach wider segment of users.  Users are also more interested in projects that are in reasonable level of maturity so they will select OSS Project which is already in 5 – Production / Stable development status.  The selected Operating System in Windows or Linux-like are also reasonable since both are the most popular desktop-based Operating System.  The need for reviews and thumbs by other users seems to have good influence for another users to download and try the OSS The file size in MB magnitude appears with possible explanation that users are more interested in larger scale OSS Project than medium or small one.  Lastly, the English or European language translation is important since many of OSS Projects are originated from this region \(Englishspeaking countries or other European language-speaking countries\. It is also interesting to note that some freedom is still available for project initiator to decide i.e. topic programming language and description of his/her project without affecting the number of download Some caution should be considered relating to these rules The subject being researched is small to medium OSS Projects 


 from sourceforge.net that may not reflect the whole population of OSS Projects that are small, medium and large scale.  These result should also verified using OSS Project data from other portal i.e. launchpad.net, google code, etc. to verify their validity VI  C ONCLUSION  We present the Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule of 134,549 OSS Projects crawled from sourceforge.net portal This covers about 84% of the total of 160,141 OSS Projects registered at the portal in the month of January 2010.  There are more than 27 parameter being recorded into MySQL database i.e. audience, audience count, database environment database environment count, developer count, development status, development status count, number of download filename and file size, license, license count, operating system, operating system count, programming language programming language count, review count, topic, topic count, translation, translation count, user interface, and user interface count The result of this datamining process are 6 success factors that may be applied by project initiators and developers in order to increase the probability of success of their projects The details of the guidelines is shown in Section V. Future work of this research include expanding the experiment to cover other portal i.e. launchpad.net, google code and freshmeat.net ACKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors would like to thank Maranatha Christian University \(http://www.maranatha.edu\ that provides the funding for this research and Department of Computer Science and Electronics at Gadjah Mada University http://mkom.ugm.ac.id\ which provides guideline and technical assistance for the research R EFERENCES  1  R.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
