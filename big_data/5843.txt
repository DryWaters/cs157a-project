  Privacy is a major concern in management of Big Data, especially for datasets that contain sensitive personal information. A model that is widely used to protect privacy is kanonymity, which can be generally defined as a clustering method in which any record in a dataset is indistinguishable from at least \(k-1\ther records in the same dataset. Most of the approaches to k-anonymity suffer from huge information loss by abstraction of continuous numerical and categorical attributes that have a hierarchical structure. It is difficult to use 
ABSTRACT 
conventional k-anonymity in actual internet services because of computational complexity and value loss from loss of information 000\003 000\003 
This paper presents a k-anonymity method based on the SEM Search Engine Marketing\ price of personal information for practical use in Big Data management services. We evaluate kanonymized qualitative data with SEM price, which is a quantitative indicator. This approach makes it possible to calculate only the necessary data and keep a k-anonymized level Application the method to actual data shows that there is a point 
 
at which a high value can be achieved for both k-anonymity and SEM price. Developing this method will enable efficient storage of personal data and the application of k-anonymity to actual Internet services 
 Introduction  
A result of increasing awaren ess of the need to protect personal information in recent years is the high cost of storing and maintaining personal information \(microdata\ and the risk of data leaks borne by companies that provide communication

services as well as companies in other industries Businesses and other orga nizations guard against data leaks by continuous updating of security systems to meet frequently-changing standards SOC, PCIDSS, and ISO27001 etc.\reat cost and commitment of resources Anonymization is one promising way to safely distribute personal information. An approach called k-anonymit in  particular has been well-studied as a good means of evaluating security level, but it has been used in very few actual internet or marketing services. Examples of actual use include medical 
information provision tools that use optimal lattice anonymization [5  and pu blic inf o r m atio n  prov isio n to ols that use the \002-argus algorithm. [5  Such services are not as easy to use as ordinary Internet services, because the types of data and how the data can be used are fixed and immediate responses cannot be provided One contributing problem is the large number of attribute combinations. Also, implementation of k-anonymity requires the calculation of a huge number of attribute combinations identifiers, quasi-identifiers sensitive attributes, non-sensitive attributes, etc.\ecause impor tant personal information tends 
to have many important attributes, the complexity of kanonymity increases with the number of combinations of data required. Also, because personal information is constantly changing, a k-anonymity method that allows periodic recalculation is needed A practical service that uses k-anonymity must have a response time of about 2 seconds. It is well-known that Internet customers demand that pages be displayed within three seconds. Research done in 2012 has shown that over 40% of e-commerce site customer s consider switching to other sites when a page fails to display within 2 second  The relationship between the response time and the size of 
the database is shown in Fig. 1, where the horizontal axis represents the number of rows of data in one database table and the vertical axis indicates the response time for queries We investigated "count\(*\" and "likeé queries under the assumption that the queries are run as pre-processing checks for the entire table in a typical application

number of columns times 3.24e-06 seconds for a çcount query. Although server performance will continue to improve in the future, we should set the maximum number of anonymous data table rows to between 10^6 and 10^9 for suitable performance The logical limit for computational complexity in kanonymizing is the sum of the products of the numbers of data items for which there are two or more choices \(k 004 2 Because the number of multiplication operations increases with the number of attribute combinations, the computational complexity increases exponentially with the number of personal information attributes Another problem is the lack of criteria for measuring the value of anonymity patterns. In particular, there is no qualitative evaluator for free-description type qualitative attributes. Even for a relatively quantitative attribute such as age, there are three patterns for abstracting the data into broad classes as listed below 1 Mathematical: Automatic classification by analysis tools histograms Sturges' formula, Pareto analysis, etc 2. Marketing Classification by general concept or QID teen/20's/30's  or school grade, etc 3 Limited application: Classificatio n according to particular marketing needs \(e.g., çQID: over 20 years oldé is required by alcoholic beverage makers  Even the above three patterns allow for unlimited classification schemes, so it is im possible to know what best pattern meets any particular purpose It is also impossible to know in advance what classification needs might arise in our society As the amount of data to be pr ocessed increases, there is a greater division of labor between engineers that process the data and marketers that use the data in analysis. That can result in a large recognition gap between the marketers, who put utility first, and the k-anonymization engineers, who put security first, and situations arise in which the technician may remove items that marketers need. Such problems occur because there are no criteria fo r judging the suitability of methods for abstracting sensitive attributes To apply k-anonymity in actual services, we must both reduce the computational complexity to a level that enables use of ordinary databases and establish some criteria for evaluating data abstractions without loss of usability In this paper, we propose a means of reducing the computational complexity of k-anonymity while minimizing loss of data utility. We also present the results of experiments conducted with real service data that confirm the effectiveness of our method The k-anonymity method has been well-studied as a means of processing personal information so that it cannot be used to identify individual persons The personal information is represented as attribute and value fields of records in a database table. Although individual attributes do not identify a person, there are combinations of attributes that may identify individuals. We call such combinations çquasi-identifiers QID\. We also define çsensitive attributesé \(SA\, which should not be disclosed if a person is identified If the values of QID attributes are known in an attack, they can be used to identify the user's record in the database and thus to discover the values of sensitive attributes. One known way to prevent that is to gene ralize the QID attribute values to more abstract values. Then, if there at least k records that are identified by the QID, the table satisfies k-anonymity  The main algorithms used to implement k-anonymity in applications for anonymizing government and medical data include Datafly  d  002 Argus  T h os e alg orithm s  suppress and generalize data so that the number of occurrences is no greater than k. Most of the algorithms recode and generalize  the data of each dataset \(SA/QID\to anonymized attributes by reducing the number of occurrences of identifying combinations of data to the value of k or less Recoding can be broadly categorized as local suppression and global recoding. Local suppression rewrites the value of the attribute itself. Global recoding rewrites data to change the overall occurrence rate of attributes. Global recoding involves so many possible changes that it is difficult to find the correct method efficiently Evaluation criteria for k-anon ymity are mainly based on the level of information loss. If the value of k is defined as the level of security, there will always be a conflict with the current use of information loss to evaluate anonymity These criteria are also affected by social situations in different areas, such as customer complaints or religious doctrine. For example, in the case of the çT point toolbaré in Japan in 2012, many users complained that toolbar provisions relating to the collection of personal information were not clearly evident and the company was forced to change their business policy.[11 T h e doub t and q u estio n s fr o m u se r s caused by such cases affect other companies in the industry as well, forcing changes in business practices and reducing business opportunities In the future, the government will continue to specify legal guidelines regarding security, so even if the value of k meets the criteria established by law at a particular time, changes in the criteria may result in the occurrence of a major security incident.  Flexible response to ch anging levels of security for personal information is required to meet user needs Regarding the level of information loss, too, there is a clear gap between the security level that the majority of users considers good and the level d esired by marketers in actual

practice. Information loss canno t serve as the criterion for evaluating the level gap between user needs and marketer needs. We think the index for evaluation in k-anonymity should be a concept that varies according to marketing and customer value rather than the amount of information loss Having indicators that can be used to evaluate the security and benefits of k-anonymity in actual business applications would allow application of k-anonymity in ordinary internet services We suggest that change in information value after kanonymity processing should be evaluated using the SEM Search Engine Marketing\pr ice. SEM has been established as a standard in qualitative marketing. The SEM indicator can be used to measure changes in the marketing value of data Also, because  the current monetary value of SEM is linked to current user preference s, the value is constantly changing. For example, we usually do not need Christmas gift information in the summer vacation season. If we eliminate unnecessary seasonal information, we can reduce waste in computation and data archiving The SEM auction is a contest fo r the order of ad display rather than a contest for a single product. Therefore, the display position is determined by the relationship between the bids of companies. A lower bid results in a lower display position. These prices are established only when the buyer \(ad clicker\ and seller \(ad agency and company\ are both present Ads that have never been clicked by a user in the past will be priced at zero Very many businesses now use SEM, so the SEM price has become an index of economic conditions because it indicates what is selling in various industries When converting the value of data into SEM prices, we encountered several situations in which the anonymized data had a higher value than the original data. An empirical example of change in value between original data and anonymized data is presented in Table 1 Detailed data is not necessaril y good data. Good data is often that which is simple and easily used. Therefore, data is abstracted to the level of highest economic value Generalization reduces attributes so the number of users per attribute will increase, and securi ty also increases. This is compatible with the concept of the security level of çkanonymityé. Having an attribute dictionary that has a high level of both security and utility should enable application of k-anonymity to ordinary internet services with very fast response First, we try to evaluate each attribute. If we want to advertise to all users that have attribute S, the price is calculated as advertising cost for the attribute times number of persons that have the attribute We obtained the advertising cost from an SEM tool and multiplied the unit price by the number of people that have the attribute to get to get the total marketing price for each attribute. We then summed the values to obtain the total value for all of the attributes. This priceé indicator does not represent the business profit, but simply indicates data priority S\(e\ttribute S value S\(k anonymized S value s1, s2, ... sn : QID  c1, c2, ... cn : number of QID  e1, e2, ... en : SEM price of QID  000\003 This can prevent the removal high-value options among the attributes as noise because of a low incidence rate. If anonymization automatically removes items that have high marketing value, the price impact will be very high even if the frequency of occurrence is low. Such removal can be stopped by checking the prices for a certain level of reduction

this method and generalized to the form of least loss in utility value, there was a 60 6% change in value 000\003 We then removed the ID \(irreversible data\ conne ction to the original data to complete the anonymization We conducted experiments in which we used this data to create multiple data ge neralization patterns fo r different values of k to investigate the changes in value. The five patterns of generalization for the age attribute are listed Table 6  The results are presented in Tab le 6. There is no significant relationship between the value \(SEM price\ and the security level \(k\The generation grouping pattern has high value for both advertising and security. The five-year grouping has an advertising value of zero despite the lower loss of information  The data are arranged to co mpare the average marketing value and the stan dard deviation of the k value in Fig. 8. No significant relationship between the marketing value and security level \(k value\ is seen, so we conclude that there is no significant relationship between marketing value and security standards. We can therefore use the marketing price of the data evaluate security and utility The results of our experiments show that the SEM price can serve as an indicator of th e marketing value of data after k-anonymity processing. We can therefore prioritize the generalization of actual data. We also found no relationship between the anonymity level \(k\d data utility, so if there is a qualitative criterion for evaluation there is a point at which high levels of both value and security are possible We have begun the development of a price database for anonymized word data. We believe that establishing a clear priority based on data analysis value in that way will enable implementation of a mechanism for automatic, time-sensitive optimal anonymization. There is also a possibility that SEM can be used to compose gene ralization patterns that can handle the appearance of new terms for use together with automatic semantic analysis Determining the optimal solution for cost and security also makes it possible to measure th e maximum value of the data We can also expect a reduction in cost from the viewpoint of data distribution by storing high-value anonymized data in ordinary databases as a way to achieve operational independence from the original data 000\003 There are, however many problems with using SEM price, some of which are listed below 1. Daily response is required to keep up with price changes 2. Dealing with concepts that do not have an SEM price or words that have the same meaning 3. Applicability of the method to any language We will investigate issues such as those listed above in future research. We will also pr epare a dictionary and criteria for anonymization words

frequency Finally we identify that this problem is caused by setting the SMT as 2 on JUNO2 while on other nodes the SMT is set as 4 Actually such domain knowledge could be easily summarized as an empirical rule as shown in Figure 8 Figure 8 The example in Figure 7 can be summarized as an empirical rule for automatic optimization recommendation V P ERFORMANCE E VA L UAT I O N In this section we evaluate the performance overhead and scalability of S ONATA  which has been deployed on IBM Platform Symphony TM  A Experimental Methodology The MapReduce benchmarks for evaluation are widelyused Terasort and Wordcount  and the corresponding data sets are 1TB data from Tera Gen and 210GB data from Bible.txt  respectively The cluster we used for evaluation consists of up to 10 POWER7 TM R2 servers each contains 2 POWER7 TM chips and each chip has 32 hardware threads The detailed information of the evaluated cluster is listed in Table I Table I E VALUATED IBM POWER7 C LUSTERS Cluster 10 PowerLinux TM 7R2 Servers CPU 16 processor cores per server 160 total Memory 128GB per server 1280GB total Internal 6 600GB internal SAS drives Storage per server 36TB total Expansion 24 600GB SAS drives in IBM EXP24S SFF Storage Gen2-bay Drawer per server\(144TB total Network 2 10GBe connections per server Switch BNT BLADE RackSwitch G8264 The performance of MapReduce benchmarks is measured by the end-to-end execution time of a job To resist stochastic effects we run each benchmark ve times and only the minimal value is treated as the measured performance By comparing the performance of benchmarks running on the original IBM Platform Symphony TM and the version attached with S ONATA  we can quantify the additional performance overhead caused by S ONATA  B Runtime Overheads Figure 9 shows the performance overhead of S ONATA with respect to the original IBM Platform Symphony TM  on 5and 10-node clusters The rst observation is that the additional overhead caused by S ONATA is very low for the evaluated benchmarks For example even for benchmark Terasort running on the 10-node cluster the performance overhead is only 3.5 The second observation is that the additional performance overhead may vary for different benchmarks For benchmark Wordcount  the performance overhead is only 1.5 when running on 10-node cluster The third observation is that even increasing the number of nodes the performance overhead does not increase signiìcantly for the evaluated benchmarks Figure 9 The execution overhead of S ONATA compared with the original execution time without instrumentation The instrumented counters are collected for each task and the number of tasks typically increases along with the data sizes For example when sorting 512GB data the number of map tasks is only 1432 while sorting 1.5TB data the number of map tasks increases to 2796 Therefore the performance overhead may vary given different number of tasks To evaluate the scalability of S ONATA  we measure the performance of Terasort given 512GB 1TB and 1.5TB data As shown in Figure 10 we can see that given different number of tasks the performance overhead does not vary signiìcantly and the maximal execution overhead is still less than 5 Thus the results from our test cases suggest that S ONATA will a practical tool when deployed in commercial environments Figure 10 The scalability of S ONATA for different size of tasks VI C ASE S TUDIES In this section we share our experiences on tuning the full-system performance of Terasort running against IBM Platform Symphony TM on a IBM POWER7 TM cluster with the help of S ONATA  During the tuning process the performance issues we encountered can be roughly grouped into three 758 


main categories that is system problems  inappropriate runtime conìgurations and runtime inefìciency  A Diagnosing System Problems In addition to the example shown in Figure 7 where S ONATA can efìciently facilitate the identiìcation of inappropriate conìgurations of CPU e.g SMT prefetching and frequency setting we further present an example to illustrate that an abnormal disk behavior can also be detected by S ONATA  As shown in Figure 11 several reduce tasks on JUNO1 are critical outliers that postpone the overall execution time By correlating the tasks with the disk resources of the corresponding nodes we found that the total disk loads on JUNO1   1  72 GB/s are much more heavier than that of other nodes e.g  864 MB/s on node JUNO9 Figure 11 Diagnosing disk problem via S ONATA  Disk loads of node JUNO1 are much more heavier than that of other nodes e.g node JUNO9 By examining the operations during the execution of this job we nally identify that other users have run a disk benchmark on JUNO1 in the same time slot since this cluster was shared by several teams After that we obtain exclusive access to this cluster to avoid inferences from other teams B Tuning Runtime Conìgurations Similar to Hadoop MapReduce there also exists many adjustable conìgurations in IBM Platform Symphony TM for MapReduce practitioners Here we list three cases to illustrate how S ONATA can help optimize the runtime conìgurations The rst tuning case is about the buffer usage in map tasks as shown in Figure 12 In this example it can be easily identiìed the critical tasks such as task 402 by conducting task-task correlation Actually during the execution of this task we can see that multiple sorts and spills i.e 2 sorts and spills occur Due to multiple sorts and spills the resultant overhead is more than 49 of the overall map time By identifying that the overhead of sorts and spills is larger than a predeìned threshold e.g 20 S ONATA recommends to adjust the buffer-related parameters for example increase the parameter such as io.sort.mb  By increasing this parameter multiple sorts and spills could be completely eliminated and the overall performance is improved accordingly Figure 12 By correlating phase-phase correlation for critical tasks potential optimization could be recommended accordingly In this example there are multiple costly sorts and spills in the critical map task They could be eliminated by enlarging the parameter such as io.sort.mb  The second example is about the tuning of another critical parameter slowstart  for IBM Platform Symphony TM which determines the fraction of the number of map tasks that should be complete before reduce tasks are scheduled As shown in Figure 13 the bottom gure by correlating different phases in a critical reduce task the WaitInFetch phase is most time-consuming in shufîe  which occupies more than 99 of the overall execution time of the reduce task Moreover by correlating tasks with the resource usage the middle gure the corresponding CPU is not 100 fully utilized i.e 89 in shufîe  Thus we could consider to increase the value of slowstart to release more reduce slots to map slots before the completion of all map tasks The third tuning case is about the selection of appropriate compressors for data output When sorting 1TB data via Terasort  by conducting phase-phase correlation for one critical map task the shufîe phase which transfers data from the map tasks to the reduce tasks dominates the entire execution time e.g more than 70 It is intuitive to compress the data to reduce the IO disk and network overheads which is well supported by most MapReduce runtime engines Since the efìciencies of different compressors vary signiìcantly S ONATA can efìciently compare the performance of different compressors and recommend the best for further usage By comparing the performance of DefaultCodec zip and Lz4Codec compressors we found that the overall execution time of Default compressor is about 1.5 times longer than that of Lz4 compressor Besides 759 


Figure 13 By correlating the slow reduce tasks with their subphases the WaitInFetch phase is more than 99 of the overall execution time Besides the CPU is not fully utilized during the shufîe phase Thus we could increase slowstart to let more map tasks scheduled for execution by utilizing Lz4 compressor the shufîe ratio with respect to the execution time of reduce tasks can be reduced by 118 C Improving Runtime Efìciency In addition to the MapReduce practitioners the performance tool is also very helpful for the runtime designers to optimize the implementation of MapReduce engines In Apache Hadoop the map and the reduce slots can only be used for the map and the reduce tasks respectively In IBM Platform Symphony TM  the default conìguration also follows this guideline that slots cannot be shared by the map and the reduce tasks Figure 14 shows the execution behaviors of Terasort when setting 32 map slots and 32 reduce slots on each PowerLinux TM 7R2 node which contains 64 hardware threads Apparently we can see that during the rst wave of map execution the CPU utilization is relatively low on this cluster e.g the CPU utilization of node JUNO0 is less than 37 To improve the utilization of CPU IBM Platform Symphony TM offers generic slots that can be shared between the map tasks and the reduce tasks Figure 15 shows that given the same MapReduce parameters by sharing slots between the map and the reduce tasks the CPU utilization can be signiìcantly improved to more than 50 for node JUNO0 In this case the generic slots can improve the overall performance by 12.99 compared with the separated Figure 14 Terasort running with separated map and reduce task slots slots 485s vs 422s Figure 15 Terasort running with shared map and reduce task slots VII R ELATED W ORK There exists a number of research efforts to propose performance analysis approaches and tools for efìcient MapReduce processing Mantri is a system that monitors tasks and culls outliers using causeand resource-aware techniques 11 Al t hough Mantri also focused on optimizing outliers it can only address task-level outliers In contrast S ONATA facilitates the full-system performance optimization by identifying phaselevel task-level and resource-level outliers HiTune is a scalable lightweight and extensible performance analyzer for Hadoop MapReduce based on dataîowbased performance analysis 12 Al t hough Hi T une al s o shows the execution details of tasks and resource usages as S ONATA does it cannot directly provide the correlations among phases tasks and resources which are most important 760 


to efìciently identify critical outliers Moreover S ONATA can monitor the behaviors of a jobês execution on-the-îy to facilitate online optimization while HiTune only offers post-execution performance analysis Starìsh is a self-tuning system that enables Hadoop users to get good performance automatically without deep understanding of many tuning knobs available 7  O ne of the key features of Starìsh is that it can automatically set the near-optimal parameters for Hadoop jobs However Starìsh mainly focuses on the tuning of the parameters of Hadoop framework which cannot be used to optimize the runtime engines and diagnose hardware problems In other words Starìsh cannot facilitate full-system optimization Theia 13 i s a vis u alization t ool to generate visual signatures of each jobês performance by analyzing the applicationlevel logs of a Hadoop cluster The visual signatures facilitate troubleshooting the performance problems e.g hardware failure data skew and software bugs etc on the cluster However Theia cannot tackle with misconìgurations of runtime engine and underlying hardware Hadoop vaidya is a rule-based performance diagnostic tool for MapReduce jobs 14 Al t hough i t can pro vi de recommendations based on the analysis of runtime statistics it cannot facilitate full-system optimization PerfXPlain is a system enables users to ask questions about the relative performances i.e runtimes of pairs of MapReduce jobs 15 Ho we v e r  t h i s s y s t em mai nl y focus es on e xpl ai ni ng the performance similarity or difference between pairs of MapReduce job or task executions In summary current approaches mainly target to the optimization of MapReduce parameters which cannot be helpful for full-system optimization In contrast by correlating different phases tasks and resources S ONATA is able to efìciently identify critical outliers for full-system optimization Besides the monitoring capability of S ONATA can facilitate the online optimization of MapReduce applications VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we present a correlation-based performance analysis approach to efìciently identify the critical outliers for full-system MapReduce optimization The key intuition is that the critical outliers can only be accurately and efìciently identiìed by correlating different phases tasks and hardware resources Once critical outliers are identiìed several empirical optimization rules can be deployed to tame them The proposed approach is further implemented as a tool named as S ONATA S ONATA has been deployed on IBM Platform Symphony TM  and experimental results show that it only causes less than 5 performance overhead for more than 2000 tasks on a 10-node PowerLinux TM 7R2 system Finally with the help of S ONATA  we manage to sort 1TB data in 7 minutes on this system running IBM Platform Symphony TM  A CKNOWLEDGEMENT We would like to thank H Peter Hofstee and Jian Li for sharing the cluster with us We also would like to thank Zane Hu Alicia Chin and Yonggang Hu for providing product supports R EFERENCES  J Dean and S  Ghema w a t  Mapreduce si mpl i  ed dat a processing on large clusters in Proceedings of OSDIê04  2004 pp 137Ö150   Apache hadoop  h ttp hadoop apache or g  Cloudera enterprise core  h ttp://www  c loudera com/content cloudera/en/products/cloudera-enterprise-core.html 4  Ib m i n f o s p h e re b i g i n s ig h t s  h ttp www-0 1  ib m.co m software/data/infosphere/biginsights  Ibm platform symphon y   h ttp://www-03 ibm com/systems technicalcomputing/platformcomputing/products/symphony 6 K  K ambat l a  A  P at hak and H P ucha T o w ar ds opt i m i z i n g hadoop provisioning in the cloud in Proceedings of HotCloudê09  2009 7 H  H er odot ou H L i m G L uo N B o r i so v  L  Dong F  B  Cetin and S Babu Starìsh A self-tuning system for big data analytics in Proceedings of CIDRê11  2011 pp 261 272 8 Z  R en X Xu J  W an W  S hi  and M Z hou W or kl oad characterization on a production hadoop cluster A case study on taobao in Proceedings of IISWCê12  2012 pp 3Ö13 9 P  W  F r e y a nd G Al onso Mi ni mi zi ng t h e h i dden cost of rdma in Proceedings of ICDCS 09  2009 pp 553Ö560 10 Gan g lia mo n ito rin g s y stem  h ttp g an g lia.so u r cefo r g e n et  G Anant hanar ayanan S  Kandul a A Gr eenber g I  S t oi ca Y Lu B Saha and E Harris Reining in the outliers in mapreduce clusters using mantri in Proceedings of OSDIê10  2010 pp 1Ö16  J Dai  J Huang S  Huang B  Huang and Y  L i u Hi t une dataîow-based performance analysis for big data cloud in Proceedings of ATCê11  2011 pp 7Ö20  E  G a r duno S  P  K a vul ya J T an R  G andhi  a nd P Narasimhan Theia visual signatures for problem diagnosis in large hadoop clusters in Proceedings of LISAê12  2012 pp 33Ö42  Hadoop v a idya  h ttp://hadoop apache or g/docs/stable/v aidya html  N Khoussai no v a  M  B al azi nska and D  S uci u   P e r f xpl ai n debugging mapreduce job performance Proc VLDB Endow  vol 5 no 7 pp 598Ö609 2012 761
