Visualization of Big SPH Simulations via Compressed Octree Grids\nFlorian Reichl, Marc Treib, and Ru¨diger Westermann\nComputer Graphics & Visualization Group\nTechnische Universita¨t Mu¨nchen\nMunich, Germany\nEmail reichlf@in.tum.de, {treib,westermann}@tum.de\nAbstract—Interactive and high-quality visualization of spa-\ntially continuous 3D ?elds represented by scattered distri-\nbutions of billions of particles is challenging. One common\napproach is to resample the quantities carried by the par-\nticles to a regular grid and to render the grid via volume\nray-casting. In large-scale applications such as astrophysics,\nhowever, the required grid resolution can easily exceed 10K\nsamples per spatial dimension, letting resampling approaches\nappear unfeasible. In this paper we demonstrate that even\nin these extreme cases such approaches perform surprisingly\nwell, both in terms of memory requirement and rendering\nperformance. We resample the particle data to a multireso-\nlution multiblock grid, where the resolution of the blocks is\ndictated by the particle distribution. From this structure we\nbuild an octree grid, and we then compress each block in the\nhierarchy at no visual loss using wavelet-based compression.\nSince decompression can be performed on the GPU, it can\nbe integrated effectively into GPU-based out-of-core volume\nray-casting. We compare our approach to the perspective grid\napproach which resamples at run-time into a view-aligned grid.\nWe demonstrate considerably faster rendering times at high\nquality, at only a moderate memory increase compared to the\nraw particle set.\nKeywords-SPH; volume rendering; data compression;\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn particle-based simulation techniques such as smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics \(SPH reconstructed from a discrete set of particles\ncarrying physical quantities. Since the particles are scattered\nirregularly over the 3D spatial domain, the reconstruction\nprocess requires determining at every spatial domain point\nthe set of particles having in?uence on this point, and\nweighting their contributions to form the resulting value.\nRendering SPH data can be done via volume ray-casting,\nby determining at every sampling point along the rays\nthe in?uencing particle set and accumulating the respective\nvalues. This however, requires huge numbers of search\nqueries per ray to determine these sets locally.\nA different approach is to resample the particle data into\na grid in a pre-process and use cell-wise interpolation for\nreconstructing the values along the rays during rendering.\nThis approach results in a view-independent volume repre-\nsentation and does not require any overlap queries at run-\ntime. If the data is resampled to a uniform grid, 3D texture-\nbased volume rendering on the GPU can be used.\nThis resampling grid introduces a signi?cant memory\noverhead, especially when the particle density dictates a high\nresolution to capture all simulation details. For instance, in\nthe gas dynamics simulation addressed in the current work—\nthe Millennium Run—more than 10 billion particles were\nused to trace the evolution of the matter distribution in a\ncubic region of the universe. The spatial resolution of this\nsimulation corresponds to an effective uniform grid size of\nabout 100,0003.\nTo overcome the memory overhead of a uniform grid in\nobject space, a non-uniform discretization of the view frus-\ntum was introduced by Fraedrich et al. [1]: the perspective\ngrid. In every frame, the particles affecting the data values at\npoints in the view frustum are resampled into this grid This\nwork also relies on a particle level-of-detail \(LoD resampled particles with\ndecreasing sampling frequency. This structure represents the\nparticle set at ever coarser resolutions with fewer and fewer\nparticles, and it is computed in a pre-process based on\nspeci?c particle merging rules. The perspective grid is very\nmemory-ef?cient, but it requires resampling large sets of\nparticles in every frame; this process vastly dominates the\nrendering times and limits the performance signi?cantly.\nA. Contribution\nIn this work we shed light on the question whether the per-\nformance limitations of the perspective grid approach can be\novercome by resampling to a uniform grid in a pre-process\nand using volume ray-casting on this grid. While this seems\npossible because at runtime any resampling of the particle\ndata to a grid can be avoided, it is unclear whether bandwidth\nlimitations due to the tremendous memory requirement of a\nuniform grid can be overcome.\nWe address this problem in two ways: Firstly, we con-\nstruct an octree grid which adapts locally to the resolution\nnecessary to capture all simulation details In this way, the\nmemory requirement of the grid structure can be reduced\nconsiderably. Furthermore, standard GPU LoD ray-casting\ncan be employed to lower the memory requirement per\nframe. Secondly, we embed a compression layer into our\nout-of-core volume ray-casting system to further reduce the\noctree’s size in memory and to reduce bandwidth require-\nments when streaming the data from disk.

since it aims \nto provide services to a specific group by picking representative \nconsumer\(s context, this research pays attention to the \nprovision of services to individuals, and can help judge how best \nto answer the questions “What should the company do for the \nconsumer?” and “What are consumers demanding?”  \nIn order to deal with considerable number of data that \ngenerates from the end services, a conceptual scenario to data \ncollection, management, and re-production was proposed [5]. A \ncycle for data processing in a hybridization of worlds, named \nHyper World, \(i.e., cyber world, real world, and social world nwas addressed, which claims that collected data \(via available \nsensors process while the \ndata is being produced to a knowledge for the provision of \nservices to users. With this process, efficient data management \nprocess and high quality services can be delivered. \nIn summary, an emerging model which collects the \nbehaviours of users continuously, analyzes the data accordingly, \nand produces solutions correctly is envisioned in the \ndevelopment of a smart e-commerce environment. The concept nof Cyber-I [6] is put forward as the main actor and implemented \nas the core mechanism of this study. \nIII. A SMART BUSINESS FRAMEWORK BASED ON \nCONSUMER BEHAVIOUR MODELING\nThe success of a smart business is based on satisfying \nconsumers by providing them appropriate services so as to retain \ntheir regular consumers and attract new consumers. In order to \nachieve this, the most important point is to understand each \nindividual consumer. Face-to-face interaction is a traditional and \neasy way of getting to know consumers. However, with the \nappearance of the Internet and advanced IT and Web \ntechnologies, online business has become more and more \npopular, reducing the amount of face-to-face interaction in the \nreal world whilst increasing consumer activities in the Cyber \ndigital world. We are actually living in a Hyperworld including \nthe Cyberworld and the real world, and depositing huge of \nactivity data in the Hyperworld. \nAlthough face-to-face interaction is becoming less and less\nfrequent in the business process, each consumer’s footprint left \nin the Hyperworld provides valuable data for understanding \nconsumers through data mining, information extraction, and nknowledge discovery. This paper proposes a new business \nparadigm, i.e., a consumer behaviour modeling based smart \nbusiness framework. An overview \(Figure 1 1 acquisition; \(2 3 DIK 4 behaviour model; and \(5 shopping or other physical activities in the real world; \nonline shopping or SNS social activities on the Web other \nassociated or related environmental data and information. The \ndata mining engine is for mining processes through a \ncombination of mining techniques \(e.g., statistics algorithms and \npractical machine learning tools nfusion, information fusion, knowledge fusion and their hybrid \nfusion approaches, both to provide a specified service or \nadvertisement to a consumer, or prediction of future products. \nThe consumer behaviour model is a digital description of a \nconsumer in the real world, which is based on the concept of \nCyber-I and particularly from the business viewpoint. The open \nplatform is to enable the consumer behaviour model to be built \nand grow, not only from the business viewpoint via the data \nmining engine and the data fusion engine but also from third-\nparty contributions. Any third party can benefit from the \nframework by referring to the consumer model to provide better \nservices to the consumer. Three goals of this business \nframework are to provide the best and most appropriate services \nto consumers, to provide personalized advertisement; and to npredict products based on CBM.\n1.

They are to be explained in the following \nsubsections. \nA. Data Mining Engine \nData collected from the Web and contexts are analyzed \nthrough the Data Mining Engine, which are multi-dimensional \ndata such as activity logs, behaviour information, environmental \ncontext, etc. with variety of types, huge volume, and high \ncomplexity. A single data mining algorithm or one-step mining \nis limited and not able to achieve the task. In this research, we \nproposed a new data mining approach, i.e., the objective oriented \nfusion mining algorithm. The fusion techniques may be applied \nto three levels of fusion: data level \(data fusion algorithm level \n\(algorithm fusion decision fusion type of the algorithm \nlevel fusion. For analyzing user behaviour, Bayesian network [7]\nis often used; Xiao’s credit scoring algorithm [8] may be good \nfor predicting seceders by using features based on attributes of 


nconsumer combined with genetic algorithm based Bayesian \nnetwork; The association rules and patterns about collections of \nitems bought by consumer may be extracted by the apriori \nalgorithm [9]. The extracted rules are easy to refer to promotion \nactivities; Consumer’s tendency is extracted briefly by Principal \ncomponent analysis [10]. Regression analysis [11] may use to \nknow what attributes are related with sales strongly Before the \nalgorithm fusion is performed, it is critical to have data filtering, \nclustering, and fusion properly according to a specific mining \nobjective. \n In addition, it may be necessary to merge or combine the noutcomes from different mining algorithms for the value \nincrease referring to a specific business objective Meanwhile, it \nmay be important to the value increase by taking into account \ncontext from consumer profile environmental data and \ninformation, such as date, weather, events, etc. Whether it is \nnecessary or whether it is important are governed by the \nobjective oriented mining rule manager. \nB. Data/Information/Knowledge Fusion Module \nKnowledge object is a measurement unit for data mining in \nthe scenario, where each knowledge object represents a specific \ntarget \(e.g., consumer, product, etc knowledge object to the knowledge representation that \nidentifies precise and detail characteristics of consumers. \nFollowing methods [12] are applied to produce a new \nknowledge object from collected data. \n1 Enhancement process: Strong correlations among \ncollecged data \(e.g., characteristics in CBM be \nadditional desctipions of knowledge objects \(i.e., metadata objects based on \npredefined fusion rules.\n2 objectively, knowledge objects from data mining \nengine are applied to multi-dimentional attributes in CBM by nfusing knowledge objects from data mining engine and multiple \npersonal information in consumer behaviour model. Certain \nattributes are updated from data mining engine based on \npredefined fusion rules.\nGenerated knowledge objects are then assimilated into the \nconsumer behaviour model to efficiently prompt the nprofiling/modeling the consumer. This process, focusing on the \nindividual, improves the accuracy than conventional one for a \ngroup of consumers. \nC. Growing Consumer Behaviour Model  \nCBM grows dynamically according to continuous \nassimilation of activity logs and contexts related to consumers. \nTwo processes are included: \(1 extract details \(e.g., behaviour, hidden attributes, \nknowledge objects, etc in the \ndata mining engine and data/information/knowledge fusion \nengine are applied; and \(2 the open platform \nby the knowledge about the consumer from multiple \nperspectives obtained from the services and applications as \nwell data of the consumer in exploiting \nservices and applications provided by third parties is important \nresource for further well-understanding the consumer, which can \nbe enabled by the open platform which enables the third parties’\ninvolvement and contributions. The model, the digital \ndescription of the consumer behaviours gets closer and closer to \nthe real world’s consumer through its growth. \nD. An Open Platform \nData such as personal information, activities, etc. are kept by \nbusiness companies in a profile-like file. CBM is applied with \ntwo main modules: an essence module and a growable module.\nAs we know it is important to well understand a person from \ndifferent aspects and angles, the growing module enables the \nconsumer model evolving with the business process and \nobtaining contributions from the external third parties. Of course, \na third party can share the consumer behaviour model upon a \nmutual beneficial agreement and authentication.\nThese are carried out on the open platform as shown in Fig. \n1. The consumer behaviour model is shared with third parties on nthe open platform. A suit of APIs is provided for a third party to \nmake contributions via providing services or applications to the \nconsumer. A suit of APIs is provided for a third party to share \nthe model for provide their own better and active services to the \nconsumer. The more interactions the consumer in this business nprocess and in the services and application provided by third \nparties, the more pieces of activity and behaviour data left, the \nbusiness paradigm can better understand the consumer through \nthe data cycle from raw data to smart services. Although the \nopen platform is a crucial part to implement CBM, challenges \non privacy and security issues need further consideration. \nE. Computational Psychological Model Embedded  \nIn order to provide consumers personalized service/product \nrecommendation, we attempt to not only understand what a \nconsumer is interested in, but also take account of their \nemotional feeling how one feels by embedding a computational \npersonality associated emotion model [13] in the consumer \nbehaviour model for consumer shopping behaviour modeling.\n814\nThe consumer behaviour model is based on the concept of nCyber-Individual [6], which is the counterpart of real individual \nin the digital world and it is also so-called digital clone of real \nindividual. A Cyber-Individual is a comprehensive digital \ndescription of its real individual. A consumer behaviour model \nis one aspect of the Cyber-Individual from viewpoint of nshopping.  \nThe personality associated emotional model in the consumer \nbehaviour model takes one’s 


personality into account. It \ndescribes both emotional state in PAD space [14] and plots one’s\npersonality in PAD space as well by converting personality’s big \nfive values [15, 16] to three coordinate values of a point in PAD \nspace. To a same event, different consumers may be more or less \ndifferently triggered and have different emotional reaction, \nwhich is quite important for a success business to have slightly \ndifferent ways for handling different consumers in services or an \nunexpected event by taking care consumer’s emotional feeling\nand provide transparent services [17] to make them feeling \nsatisfactory and happy.  \nV. TWO BUSINESS SCENARIOS\nThis section describes two business scenarios with the focus \non provision of the personalized advertisements and services. \nThis system runs the scenario simulations to demonstrate what \nand how personalized advertisements and services are \nconcluded and delivered along with the growth of the model.\nThe scenarios as given in Fig. 2 are as follows: a woman, \nRosemary was a housewife who registered in an electronic \ncommerce and Internet based company which consists of the \nseveral businesses: online retail travel agent, banking system, et \nal. like “Rakuten”. After she registered, the system generates the ncorresponding base model.\nRosemary model\nConclusion\nActivity\ngrow grow\nUpdating\n???\n???\n???\n- register with personal \ninformation\n- buy red wines almost every \nweek from various bland\n- bought red wines are almost nmade in France.\n- buy cheese and other \nsnacks which go well with \nwine\n- name\n- date of birth\n- family members\n- occupation\n- likes red wines as alcohol\n- interested in red wine\n- likes red wines made in \nFrance\nwould prefer foods which \ngo well with red wine\nMining\n- profile\n- interest\n- preference\n- lifestyle\n profile\n- interest\n- preference\n- profile\nSetting up a small red wine \nretail business\nFig.2 The growth of Rosemary model as her accumulated activity data. \nA. Consumer Purchasing Behaviour Modeling \nOne day, Rosemary bought the red wines made in the \nspecific region of France on the site. After that she bought them \nregularly since she likes them. Starting with Rosemary’s history \naction behaviour input, the data mining engine works along the \nfollowing processes to conclude like “she seems to like red \nwines made in France”.\n1 A filtering and clustering algorithm is \napplied to her purchasing history data and generates a data \npackage indicating her favorites.\n2 her frequent shopping pattern as \ninformation like “often to buy red wines”. A Principle \ncomponent analysis is exploited to discover the knowledge \nabout her shopping tendency like “the probability of buying red \nwine made in France is high”.\n3 and/or knowledge from various data \nmining techniques so as to make a conclusion like “she seems \nlike red wine made in France”.\nThe outcomes \(conclusions consumer characteristics to be \nadded to the consumer purchasing behaviour model for \nspiraling enhancement of the consumer behaviour model.\n815\nThe information, “she used to buy red wines”, is enhanced \nwith the predefined fusion rules like rule 1 and 2 in TABLE I.\nAs a result, her model is updated as “red wine is her favorite item \nin alcohol” and “she is interested in red wine”. At the same time, \nthe enhanced information is also extended with another \ninformation, “she buys red wines from various bland”, and the \npredefined fusion rule like rule 3 in TABLE I. As a result, her \nmodel is updated as “she would perhaps be a retailer of red wine”\nTABLE I. THE EXAMPLE OF PREDEFINED FUSION RULES\nRule \nID IF THEN\n1 ?item is included in ?category and he/she used to buy ?item\n?item is his/her favorite \nitem in ?category\n2 ?item is his/her favorite item he/she is interested in ?item\n3 he/she often to buy ?item and he/shebuy ?item from various bland\nhe/she would perhaps be \na retailer of ?item\n?? ?? ??\nB. Dynamic Evolutionary Model and Personalized \nServices/Advertisments in EC Site \nAt first Rosemary model is nothing more than her profile. \nBut various attributes of her model are filled and updated as time \ngoes with the continuing updated activity history. The \npersonalized services and advertisements are provided \naccordingly referring to her growing model. \nPersonalized advertisements/services are actively pushed to \nindividual consumers according to their current favorites, \ninterests, and preferences which are extracted from their \npurchasing activities and other action behaviours.\nIn this scenario, after updating her interests in her model, the \nsystem sent her advertisement mails about the popular wines, the nwine cooler and the cheese as snacks et al. Then, Rosemary \nclicked the cheese information link and buy some cheese and \nother snacks. As the result, the system guessed that she would \nprefer foods which go well with wine and added her tendency to \nher model. This makes the system sent more appropriate \nadvertisements or services to her and she is getting more and \nmore involvement with this system and the system know more \nand more about her and continues to enhance her behaviour \nmodel. Therefore, her action behaviour and the system services \nbecome a good and positive circulation. Thus, her behaviour \nmodel is also continuously updated or grows.\nVI.

Data Mining Engine Module \nThis module contains several classes like Data, Dataset,\nPattern, DatamingAlgorithm, DataminingManager, and \nabstract class, AlgorithmFusionCenter. Data objects takes the \nacquired data from the database and Dataset objects generate \ndatasets from Data objects by the data fusion algorithm.  \nDataminingManager class provides a variety of methods to \ndecide the policies according to the meta-mining rules for \nappropriate combination of datasets, mining task requirements, \nand mining algorithms. AlgorithmFusionCenter is an abstract \nclass which provides some abstract methods for fusing data \nmining algorithms by taking consideration of datasets algorithm \nfeatures, and mining requirements. The data mining results are \nrepresented in a variety of patterns interpretable and usable by \nDIKFusion objects.\nB. Data/Information/Knowledge\(DIK nThis module provides mechanisms for data, information, and \nknowledge fusions in 7 different fusion patterns It includes two \n816\ndatabases and two main classes, DIKFusionManager and \nDIKFusion. DIKFusionManager holds a set of fusion policies \nand decides DIK fusion method according to business service \nrequirement and consumer’s situation. With the selected fusion \npolicy from DIKFusionManager object, DIKFusion object nactually performs the fusion process by invoking a fusion \nalgorithm which takes data mining results from Pattern objects, \nhuman features from AttributeSet objects, and fusion task \nrequirements from Fusion rules in the database.\nC. API Module \nAPI provides interfaces between the consumer behaviour \nmodel and the DIK fusion engine. It includes \nAccessibleAttribute interface and AttributeSet class. The former \ndefines the specifications for the interface to the consumer \nbehaviour model. The AttributeSet objects are a set of attributes \ninterpreting consumer’s characteristics and behaviours for use in \nDIK fusion engine or for contribution to the model.\nD. Model Module \nThis module is built based on the concept of Cyber-I. It is ncomposed of consumer’s dynamic attributes and static attributes \ndescribing a consumer’s features, in particular, purchasing \nbehaviour features. A Model object is the digital description of \na consumer StaticAttribute object describes a consumer’s static \nfeatures, relatively stable, not often changed or updated and \nDynamicAttribute object describes a consumer’s dynamic \nfeatures, frequently changed or updated nVII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper outlines a smart business framework which \nconcentrates on raw behaviour data from end users. A data cycle \nis employed to deal with raw data, including the raw data of nusers and their derivative characteristics. Key features of the \nproposed framework include: \(1 user model that \ncollects data, behaviour data being especially focused on, and \nemploys machine learning techniques to obtain and understand \nusers’ needs and preferences; \(2 npersonalization and personalized services to be performed; and \n\(3 possible for an e-business \nincorporation to investigate and develop potential, on-demand, \nservices and products as well which in general are in need or \nurgently on demand.  \nAside from the above-mentioned features, a potential model, \ni.e., a growing model, that continuously collects data, analyzes \ndata, and produces instant feedback is worth mentioning. \nAlthough it takes time to grow and requires complex data from nusers with great diversity and variety, such models will be the \ntrend in the field of user modeling. To enable this, the proposed \nframework incorporates an open platform with a suit of APIs to \nenable a third-party to share the behaviour model, and to plug in \napplications via a developed platform that collects further \nactivity data so as to allow growth of the model.  \nThough some limitations remain, it is certain that the \nconstruction and development of a system to provide smart \nbusiness services is a worthwhile attempt to meet a profound \nsocietal need. In the coming future of big data, we believe that \nmining \(and understanding nframework demonstrates the feasibility of envisioned scenarios \nand the concrete implementation that will emerge based on the \nframework and models. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe work is partially supported by the Japan Society for the \nPromotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research \n\(No. 25330270  ReferencesT.

The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators.

Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload.

A computational tool has been developed that can\nautomatically enumerate and evaluate thousands of different\nSCaN architectures. This tool contains both a performance\nand a cost model.\nNext Steps\nThe next steps include calibration of the optical link budget\ncalculations, comparisons of the network scheduling calcula-\ntions with historical TDRSS load data, and validation of the\nspacecraft sizing algorithm with real TDRS data. Following\nthe completion of the stakeholder analysis, the tool will be\nbe used to explore the architectural tradespace and identify\na subset of preferred architectures worth studying in more\ndetail.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
