Online Client-AP Association in WLANs Gaurav S Kasbekar Pavan Nuggehalli and Joy Kuri Centre for Electronics Design and Technology Indian Institute of Science Bangalore ksgaurav,pavan,kuri cedt.iisc.ernet.in Abstract  In many IEEE 802.11 WLAN deployments wireless clients have a choice of access points AP to connect to In current systems clients associate with the access point with the strongest signal to noise ratio However such an association mechanism can lead to unequal load sharing resulting in diminished system performance In this paper we rst provide a 
numerical approach based on stochastic dynamic programming to nd the optimal client-AP association algorithm for a small topology consisting of two access points Using the value iteration algorithm we determine the optimal association rule for the two-AP topology Next utilizing the insights obtained from the optimal association rule for the two-AP case we propose a near-optimal heuristic that we call RAT  We test the efìcacy of RAT by considering more realistic arrival patterns and a larger topology Our results show that RAT performs very well in these scenarios as well Moreover RAT lends itself to a fairly simple 
implementation I I NTRODUCTION IEEE 802.11 based wireless local area networks WLANs have become ubiquitous in homes workplaces business centers campuses and other public areas In these networks the client device or station STA scans the radio channel to detect neighboring access points APs If only a single AP is found then the user associates with this AP However in many deployments the user will nd multiple APs in its neighborhood The user will then have to select one of these APs to associate with In current WLANs the AP selection algorithm is very simple The user associates with the AP that has the strongest signal to noise ratio SNR measured by the received signal strength indicator RSSI However user throughput is a function of both received signal strength 
and the load of the AP to which the user is associated If the spatial distribution of users is non-uniform then it is likely that a few APs will be heavily lo aded while the others are only lightly loaded Such a skewed load distribution will bring down network performance and reduce user satisfaction In this paper our objective is to design good client-AP association rules that are sensitive to the loads on the APs as well as the location of the client Starting with the analytical model proposed in 1 we emplo y s t ochas tic dynamic p rogramming to nd the optimal strategy for a simple topology consisting of two APs By deìning cost functions appropriately we can 
obtain optimal AP selection algorith ms for different performance metrics such as average delay average throughput and average log-throughput Next by examining the nature of the optimal strategy we propose a heuristic named RAT for AP selection It turns out that RAT is nearly optimal for the twoAP tolopology in terms of all the performance metrics that we have considered The next step is to examine the performance of RAT in more general topologies and with more complicated arrival patterns In these larger topologies it is computationally infeasible to nd the optimal policy using dynamic programming So we compare the performance of RAT again in terms of average delay average throughput and average log-throughput with three plausible AP selection algorithms We nd that our 
heuristic outperforms all other algorithms It may be worth pointing out here that we use the stochastic dynamic programming model for a small two-AP problem only and the optimal solution to this problem motivates our heuristic RAT which is applicable to larger problems with many APs Thus we do not suggest the dynamic programming approach for practical scenarios because that may lead to the well-known state space explosion problem Rather the insights obtained from the solution of the dynamic programming based formulation are utilized to come up with a heuristic that is generally applicable Nevertheless the link between the dynamic programming formulation and the subsequent heuristic is clear Without the f ormulation we would not be 
able to identify the critical pa rameters of the heuristic policy and its overall structure Many researchers have addressed the issue of client-AP association by proposing load sensitive AP selection algorithms In 2   3    4   h euris tics are pro vided for impro ving performance 3 p ropos es decentralized algorithms which use the signal strength from each AP the number of STAs currently associated with each AP and the packet error rates of STAs communicating with each AP to select an AP 4 proposes a hand-off strategy based on the SNR that a STA can get with different APs the APês load and the association time with the AP Researchers have also built analytical models for this problem in 5 a nd 6  5  f ormulates the A P selection problem as an optimization problem to maximize different utility functions 6 g i v e s a n o f f-lin e a lg o r ith m f o r asso ciatio n

associations are dynamic For the dynamic scenario several heuristics have been proposed in past work These heuristics are based on intuition and to the best of our knowledge no attempts have been made to relate these heuristics to policies that are optimal in some pre-deìned sense Our goal is to obtain association policies that are simple and yet imitate as closely as possible policies that are provably optimal in a dynamic scenario Moreover our optimization framework is exible in that different optimization criteria can be incorporated into it Our optimization framework is also not restricted to any speciìc notion of fairness By employing different utility functions our approach can be adapted to various notions of fairness 8 In Section II we describe our system model We then apply the dynamic programming approach to a network topology consisting of two APs in Section III We develop a heuristic by interpreting the optimal polic y for this scenario In Section IV we simulate a larger topology using our heuristic as well as three other client-AP association algorithms In Section V we indicate how the heuristic may be implemented in practise We provide conclusions in Section VI II M ODEL In our model APs are located in an area  Mobile stations STAs arrive in such that the location of each STA is independently distributed according to some probability distribution The arrival of STAs is assumed to be Poisson with parameter  Each STA brings with it a le to transmit whose size is exponentially distributed with parameter TheSTA chooses an AP to associate with according to the association policy being used After co mpletely transmitting the le the STA departs Suppose that at some point in time there are STAs associated with an AP STA is associated at rate  Then Kumar et al 1 5  sho w b y a n analysis of the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function DCF that the aggregate uplink throughput is of the form 1 where is an overhead term and depends only on  the IEEE 802.11 DCF parameters and the packet length If overheads are not taken into account 1 reduces to the simpler formula 2 Moreover the throughput of each STA is equal and is given by 3 Note that if random polling were used to schedule packet transmissions of the STAs then the throughput of each STA would be given by 3 This formula shows that even one STA associated at a low rate can pull down the throughputs seen by other STAs even though these others may be associated at high rates We now describe the stochastic dynamic programming formulation We model the system as a Continuous-Time Markov Decision Chain CTMDC  Following the notation in 9  l et denote the state space In state a controller must choose one action from a nite nonempty set of actions If action is chosen then a cost rate of is incurred till the next transition The time till the next transition is exponentially distributed with parameter  If action is taken in state let be the probability that the next state is where  The objective is to minimize the long run expected average cost Let be a policy  which is a rule for choosing actions given the current state and possibly past states and actions Let be the total cost incurred during the rst state transitions Let be the initial state and be the expected total cost incurred during the rst transitions if policy is employed and the initial state is  Similarly let be the expected total time spent under during the rst transitions if the initial state is Let 4 5 A stationary policy considers only the current state in choosing actions and does not consider past states and past actions An optimal stationary policy  for which existsin many cases The objective is to nd such a policy The states actions transition probabilities and cost rates in our model are given below A States Let be the number of APs For concreteness assume that there are four rates in the rate set as in 802.11b They are indexed by integers from to and correspond to 1 2 5.5 and 11 Mbps respectively This model readily extends to an arbitrary number of rates Deìne the population matrix as follows             6 where is the number of STAs associated at rate with AP Deìnethe rate vector as follows    7 In a CTMDC a state is deìned only at transition epochs In our model transitions can be either arrivals or departures If the present transition is a n arrival then the th component of   is the maximum rate that the newly arrived STA can get with AP  We allow to model the case where the new arrival cannot associate with AP at all However we also 


assume that when the presen t transition is an arrival cannot be all-zeros We assume that the APs cover the entire area  so a STA can associate with at least one AP If the present transition is a departure is the all-zero vector The state of our system is given by 8 B Action Set If a transition corresponds to an arrival the action set is given by 9 In words the action set includes all the APs with which it is possible to associate at a non-zero rate The action  where means that the arriving STA associates with AP  For departures the only action is to continue or the null action  So for departure states there is only one action given by 10 C Transition Probabilities For a population matrix  the time till the next transition is exponential with parameter 11 where is the physical rate corresponding to index The term accounts for arrivals The second term adds the transition rates due to departures from each AP The form of this term follows from 3 It is a lso clear that the location of an arriving STA determines the vector that it sees Therefore the spatial distribution of arri vals determines the probability that an arriving STA sees rate vector Using and 3 it is straightforward though tedious to derive the transition probabilities in every state For the sake of brevity we do not provide a full derivation here D Cost Suppose the current state is and action is taken In this section we will write down expressions for thecost rate till the next transition 1 Delay as the cost In the delay as the cost model there is a unit cost per STA in the system per unit time The cost rate is given by 12 The indicator adds the STA if any which associated at the current transition If is the cost rate the average cost in 4 is the average number in system By Littleês law this is proportional to the average time that a STA spends in the system Thus by minimizing the average cost we minimize the average delay of a STA 2 Average Throughput as the reward Let be the set of all STAs in the system and be the throughput of STA  is given by 3 Also let  In the average throughput as the reward model the cost rate is given by 13 The reward rate is average throughput over all STAs in the system The reward rate is inco rporated into the model as a negative cost rate The rst term is added to make the cost rate non-negative The average throughput per STA is a better measure of the system performance than the aggregate throughput of all STAs For example as the number of STAs in the system increases the average throughput in general decreases but the aggregate throughput need not decrease Hence the average throughput is chosen as the reward rate instead of the aggregate throughput 3 Average Log Throughput as the reward The cost rate is 14 Maximizing sum of log throughput instead of aggregate throughput called proportional fairness in the literature leads to a fairer distribution of the throughput that different users get If our objective is to achieve a fair distribution of throughput of STAs we can use the cost rate in 14 Again average log throughput is used as the reward rate instead of aggregate log throughput for the reason given above Like log other utility functions may be used to give different degrees of fairness E Solution Methodology We apply the value iteration algorithm 9 t o  nd a s tationary optimal policy To that end we need to transform our CTMDC to an auxiliary Discrete Time Markov Decision Chain DTMDC Let 15 For the transformation to be valid 9 there must e x ist c onstants and such that 16 It can be easily shown that 16 is satisìed if we choose 17 18 The DTMDC is as follows States and actions are the same as in the CTMDC  The cost incurred if the system is in state and an action is taken is given by 19 The transition probability from state to state under action is given by 20

respectively 1 and 0.2 If the weights are 1 and 0 respectively we get the Selìsh Policy while if the weights are 0 and 1 respectively we get the SNR policy It is seen that the two special cases Selìsh and SNR-based are inadequate but a non-trivial combination of throughput and rate leads to stable behavior Our choice of 1 and 0.2 as the weights was arrived at by experimentation and is seen to work well We do not claim that this is the best possible choice  this issue is being explored  1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 Average Throughput \(Mbps PCENTRE Average Throughput vs. PCENTRE for  1.2 s 1 SNR Agg   RAT   0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 Average Normalized Delay \(s/ Mb PCENTRE Average Normalized Delay vs. PCENTRE for  1.2 s 1 SNR Agg   RAT   Fig 5 Results for a heavily loaded system  SNR becomes unstable for greater than about  Aggregate-throughput maximizing scheme becomes unstable for greater than about  Selìsh selection is unstable for all values of  V I MPLEMENTATION RAT can be implemented in practice as follows Each AP in its beacon frames must broadcast the sum of reciprocals of the rates at which STAs are associated with it Also a newly arrived STA can nd for each AP by measuring the signal strength from the AP Using these the STA can nd out the value of for each AP  It must then choose the AP with the greatest value of  Due to movement of STAs or a change in the wireless link conditions the AP that a STA selected upon arrival may not remain the best choice as time progresses So each STA must periodically re-run the RAT heuristic This may be implemented similar to the dynamic AP selection mechanism described in 3 Moreo v er  t he o v e rhead in listening t o t he beacon frames of nearby APs may be reduced using the SyncScan algorithm described in 11 VI C ONCLUSIONS We considered an online STA-AP association problem in WLANs In our model STAs arrive to the WLAN at random epochs join the WLAN and transfer les of random lengths and then depart We formulated an optimal association problem in this dynamic scenario using the Stochastic Dynamic Programming framework For a s mall topology we obtained the optimal association policy by using the value iteration algorithm The optimal policy motivated our RAT heuristic that is very simple nevertheless this simple heuristic was found to perform almost as well as the optimal policy for the small network More importantly RAT continued to perform very well in a larger and more realistic network and was clearly superior to several simple policies with which it was compared We also remarked upon the underlying causes of the poor behavior of these other policies Further RAT is implementable in practice in a straightforward manner  each AP needs to broadcast one additional parameter in the beacon frame Thus RAT is a promising candidate for experimental work as well R EFERENCES  A K u m a r  E  Altm an D Miorandi and M  G o yal Ne w ins ights from a xed point analysis of single cell IEEE 802.11 WLANs in Proceedings of the IEEE Infocom  2005  G  J udd and P  S teenkis te  F ixing 802 11 acces s point s e lection  i n ACM SIGCOMM 2002 Poster Session  July 2002  Y  F ukuda T  A be and Y  O ie  D ecentralized acces s point s e lection architecture for wireless LANs in Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2004  SA3 Pomona CA USA May 14Ö15 2004  L  W ang Z  Niu Y  Z hu H Deng and M Y ano Inte gration of S N R load and time in handoff initiation for wireless LAN in The 14th IEEE International Symposium on Personal Indoor and Mobile Radio Communication Proceedings  vol 3 Sept 2003 pp 2032Ö2036  A  K um ar and V  K u m a r  O ptim al as s o ciation of s tations and A P s i n an IEEE 802.11 WLAN in Proceedings of the National Conference on Communications  IIT Kharagpur JanÖFeb 2005  Y  B ejerano S  J  H an and L  E  L i F airnes s and load balancing in wireless LANs using association control in MobiComê04  Philadelphia Pennsylvania USA Sept 26ÖOct 1 2004  J  As pnes  Y  Azar  A  F iat S Plotkin and O W aarts   On-line load balancing with applications to machine scheduling and virtual circuit routing in Proceedings of ACM STOC  1993 pp 623Ö631  A  T ang J  W a ng and S  H  L o w  Is f air allocation al w ays inef  cient  in Proceedings of IEEE Infocom  Hong Kong March 2004  L  I S ennott Stochastic Dynamic Programming and the Control of Queuing Systems  John Wiley  Sons Inc 1999  G  S  K a s b ekar  J  K uri and P  S  N uggehalli O nline as s o ciation policies in IEEE 802.11 WLANs in International Symposium on Modelling and Optimization in Mobile Ad-Hoc and Wireless Networks 2006 WiOpt 06  April 2006  I Ram ani and S  S a v age SyncScan P ractical f a s t handof f f or 802 11 infrastructure networks in Proceedings of the IEEE Infocom Conference  Miami FL March 2005 


on the intention to use self- and e-assessment center as well as the influence of PQI, PCS and PTS on PU it might represent a single example for a specific economy, country or cultural region . There might be differences for the intention of different informnation systems with different settings. Future research should discuss this issue more detailed  Furthermore our questionnaire was just answered by large-scale corporations in Germany. So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required.

The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L

Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
