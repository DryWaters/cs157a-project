Firstly, we elaborate the fact that spatial \ndata plays a primary role in big data, attracting academic \ncommunity, business industry and governments. Secondly, the \nadverse of spatial data mining is discussed, such as much garbage, \nheavy pollution and its difficulties in utilization Finally, we \ndissect the value in spatial big data, expound the techniques to \ndiscover knowledge from spatial big data, and investigate the \ntransformation from knowledge into data intelligences. \nKeywords- Big data Spatial data mining; Data intelligence \nI.  SPATIALLY DISTRIBUTED BIG DATA  \nBig data is complex data set that has the following main \ncharacteristics: Volume, Variety, Velocity and Veracity [1] [2] [3] \n[4]. These make it difficult to use the existing tools to manage \nand manipulate [5] [6]. In these data, spatial data specifically \naccounts for the vast majority. About 80% of data is associated \nwith the spatial position [7 8]. Spatial data is the basis of data \nand source of wisdom for people to understand the real-world \nthrough the information world [9] [10]. Big Data is closely related \nto applications [12] [13], and spatial data mining is its principal \napplication [5] [9] [11]. \nA. From understanding the real-world to creating the ninformation world \nHuman civilization is a process from understanding the \nreal-world to creating the information world, which has gone \nthrough the following stages: preliminary sensing the world, \nhelping memory by information, recorded and inherited by \ninformation, exchange and communication by information and nunderstanding the world once again by information[14][15]. \nInitially, Human take advantage of stones and shells to count \naccording to the principle of one-to-one. And they tie knots \nNote to help memory. Later Human use simple graphics, draw \nnotes, and inherit more accurate memory through their own \nemotional prompted. When the graphics become body \nrelatively fixed common symbol, and associate with the words \nin the language, it produces texts. Texts abstract and generalize \nthe world, promote cultural understanding, and prepare the \nnecessary foundation for the development of science. Aimed at \nbreaking through the restrictions which the written symbols \ndepend on artificial copying or engraving, Human use \nmachines after industrial revolution to volume mechanized \nproduction, which improves the efficiency of the cultural \ntransmission Computer centers high-speed computing, and \nspins off the software from the hardware, contributing to the ndissemination of information "electronically" and \n"automatically". Internet centers network, interrelates ncomputers, breaking local information restriction. Mobile \ncommunication centers users, making the machine follows \nuser’s movements and unbounds human from the machine. \nInternet of Things centers applications automatically identifies \nobjects, to enable the information sharing between the human \nand things. Cloud computing centers service by consolidating \nexpertise and optimizing the allocation of resources. Big data ncenters data, and mines knowledge in the entire data, breaking \nthe sampling randomness of the sample [16 17] [18], and \ndemonstrating on big data center and mobile terminal. These \ninformation technologies serve for the understanding and \ntransforming of the real world [15]. \nB. Spatial data is the basis for big data nThe content of spatial data describes spatial objects’ \nspecific geographic orientation and spatial distribution in the \nreal world. Spatial data also includes space entities attributes, \nthe number, location and their mutual relations, and covers the \nentire Macro-Meso-Micro level. The data can be the value of \npoint height, road length, polygon area, building volume and \nthe pixel gray. It can be the string of geographical name and \nannotation. It can also be graphics, images, other multimedia, \nspatial relationships and other topologies [7] [8]. Compared with \nthe General data, spatial data is with characteristics of spatial ntemporal, multi-dimensional, Volume, complex spatial \nrelations and so on [11]. \nFor the tools of collecting spatial data, it can be macro and \nmicro sensors or devices such as radar, infrared, optical, \nsatellite multispectral scanner, digital camera, imaging \nspectrometer, electronic total station, telescopes, television ncamera, electron microscopy imaging and CT imaging. It can \nbe spatial data acquisition means such as conventional field \nmeasurements, census, land resources survey, map scanning, \nmap digitizing and statistics charts. It also can be a process of \ntechnology applications and analysis spatial data, such as \ncomputers networks, GPS, RS and GIS. The concrete content \nincludes data sources, the original observations \(raw data as \nwell as steps, format conversion, date, time, location, personnel, \nenvironmental, transmission and history of data collecting, \nediting, storage and using [10] [19]. \nThe remote sensing Earth observation has become an \nindispensable part of social, political and economic \ndevelopment decisions [7] [11] [14] [19 Spaceborne sensors, \nsatellite launch, satellite control and other hardware technology \nhas made a major breakthrough. In the future, space-based n,\(\(\(,QWHUQDWLRQDO&RQIHUHQFHRQ%LJ'DWD\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE \ninformation systems and Earth Observing System \(EOS 


real-\ntime and around-the-clock. Moreover it will gradually forms \nthe satellite \(group spatial, high spectral, \nhigh temporal resolution, wide ground covered and other \nperformance, along with positioning, communications and \nobservation functions \(Fig. 1, Fig. 2 also makes the number of bands that describing the \nspace object attributes increase from a few to dozens or even \nhundreds. Remote sensing Earth observation technologies are \nsupporting a multi-level, multi-angled all-round and around-\nthe-clock global stereoscopic earth observation network which \ncombines with high medium and low orbits and cooperates \nwith large, medium and small satellite, and coarse, fine \nresolution complement to each other. The range of ground \nresolution magnitude of the sensor is from kilometers to ncentimeters. The range of wavelength is from ultraviolet to \nlong wave. The interval is from ten days once to three times a \nday. The range of probing depth is from a few meters to ten \nthousand meters. Quick Bird, IRS IKONOS have provided \nhigh resolution remotely-sensed data through new remote \nsensing earth observation technology marked by high spatial, \nhigh spectral and high dynamic. Earth observation system with nmulti-sensor, multi-purpose, multi-resolution and multi-\nfrequency can provide Moderate-resolution Imaging nSpectroradiometer \(MODIS nmeasuring and 4-D simulating, MOPIT data and MISR data. \nNew satellite sensors with high-resolution and high dynamic \nare not only high dynamic-band number, high spectral \nresolution, high data rate, short period, but also particularly \nlarge amount of data which can reach gigabit level or above. \nFor example, the space remote sensing data obtained from \nEOS-AM1 and PM1 in one day can reach terabyte level. \nLandsat can get satellite image data global coverage every two \nweeks, and there has been decades of history data around the \nworld accumulated. \nFigure 1.  Satellite-based earth observation network \nThe speed of the construction of spatial data infrastructure \nis increasing, as well as the accumulation of space-based data \n[14]. Spatial data infrastructure has already contained a large \nnumber of cities in the electronic map database, road network nof urban planning database, engineering geological information \ndatabase, current land use database strategic planning \ninformation database, regulatory detailed planning database, \nmunicipal red line database architectural columns and building \nline database, cadaster databases and basic farmland protection \nplanning database. Furthermore, in addition to those already \nstored and accumulated data, new spatial data are being ngenerated and collected. \nFigure 2. Satellite data and services \nC. Big data is attracting much attention \nAs humans explore the real world through scientific \nresearch, humans unravel the mysteries in the information nworld through big data and data mining, which are attracting \nmuch attention from academia. In July 2008 O'Reilly Media \npublished “Beautiful Data”. In September, "Nature" published \n"Big data" album, and Microsoft published “The Fourth \nParadigm—Data Intensive Scientific Discovery”. In May 2009, \nthe United Nations “Global Pulse” project release “Big Data \nfor Development: Challenges & Opportunities” to promote \nInnovating ways to collect and analysis digital data and rapid \ndata [1]. In February 2011, “Science” published “Dealing with nData” album, and jointed Science: Signaling, Science: \nTranslational Medicine and Science: Careers to launch related \ntopics, discuss the importance of data for scientific research. In \nMay, McKinsey published “Big data: the next frontier for \ninnovation, competition, and productivity”, analyzed \napplication potential of big data in different industries from the \neconomic and commercial dimensions, spelled out the \ndevelopment policy for the Government and industry decision \nmakers dealing with big data [4]. In January 2012, the "Wall nStreet Journal" argued that big data, smart production and \nwireless network t will lead to new economic prosperity [20]. In \nMarch 2012, the United States government released “Big Data \nResearch and Development Initiative”, which roses the \ndevelopment and application of big data from business conduct \nto national deployment strategic in order to improve the ability \nto extract knowledge from large and complex data, to help \nsolve some of the nation's most pressing challenges [2] [3]. The \nU.S. National Science Foundation established a national \nresearch Center for Visual and Decision Informatics \(CVDI National Science Foundation, industry, \ngovernment agencies and universities, focusing on data mining ndecision making, and visualization. In April 2012, “Nature \nBiotechnology” invited eight biologists to evaluate an article \n14\nwhich published in December 2011 on “Science” titling \n“Detecting Novel Associations in Large Data Sets” in a paper \ntitled “Finding correlations in big data” [21]. In July 2012, \nGartner released the first data survey report “Hype Cycle for \nBig Data, 2012”, which thought deeply in big data [6 nBig data is also attracting some big names form the industry \n[13] [22] [23] [24]. In 2011, Microsoft launched Hadoop based Big \nData Solution compatible with Windows, as a component of \nSQL Server 2012. IBM launched InfoSphere BigInsights, not \nonly combined the DB2 with NoSQL database, but also had \ndone a series of acquisitions. In 2007, IBM acquired the \nbusiness intelligence software vendor Cognos. In 2009, IBM nacquired the business rules management software vendor ILOG, \ndata analysis and statistical software vendor 


SPSS and database \nanalysis software vendor Netezza. In 2010, IBM acquired web \nanalytics software vendor Coremetrics. In 2009, the newly \nreleased Elastic MapReduce using a hosted Hadoop framework, \nin that users can adjust the load to suit their needs for the data-\nintensive distributed programs work. Oracle combined the nNoSQL Database and Big Data Appliance, which enables \ncustomers to handle unstructured mass data directly Google \nuses Bigtable to distributed storage large-scale structured data \nand uses BigQuery SQL to do data query. In addition, Apple's \niCloud, Facebook's The Open Compute Project, EMC’s \nGreenplum HD are also committed to provide data solutions \nand applications. \nIn China [4] [6] [23] [24], big data attracts as much attention as it \ndoes around the world. Baidu uses Hadoop to do off-line \nprocessing since 2007. Currently Baidu has over 10,000 \nHadoop servers, which is more than Yahoo and Facebook, and \nit plans to reach 20,000 in 2013. In these servers, 80% Hadoop \nclusters are processing o total of 6TB data every day on log \nanalysis Tencent, Taobao and Alipay are also using Hadoop to \nestablish data warehouse and handle big data. In April 2010, \nTaobao launched a data mining platform “data cube”, based on \nan one hundred billion level database named OceanBase, \nwhich supports for 4 to 5 million times update operation, \nincluding over 2 billion records containing more than 2.5TB \ndata in one day. In May 2010, China Mobile established a \nmassive distributed systems and structured mass data \nmanagement system on the cloud. Huawei analyzes data based \non mobile terminals and storage massive data through the \ncloud to obtain valuable information. Alibaba analyzes nbusiness transaction data through big data technology to do \ncredit approval. In March 2012, when China's Ministry of \nScience and Technology released the “Twelve-Five 2013 \nannual national science and technology alternative project \nsolicitation Guide”, the big data research is in the first place. \nD. Spatial data is the focus of the research and development \nbig data \nThe research and development of big data involve national nsecurity, life and health, climate variation, geological survey, \ndisaster prevention and reduction and Smart Planet, which are \nall associated with spatial data [1][4][13]. For example, in the \nUnited States, government established National Information \nInfrastructure in 1993, released National Broadband Plan in \n2010, and invested 200 million dollars to start Big Data \nResearch and Development Initiative. In this plan, US nGeological Survey and National Aeronautics & Space \nAdministration are most closely associated to spatial data [2] [3]. \nThe USGS John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and \nSynthesis provides scientists with the place and time to in-\ndepth analysis, the most advanced computing ability and the \ncollaboration tools to perceive big data sets, which eventually \npromotes the innovation thinking of the Earth System Science \n\(ESS In this center, scientists cooperate to synthesize the \ncomprehensive and long-term data, and further convert big data \nand the big ideas of Earth science theory to scientific \ndiscoveries with the aim to improve the understanding of the \nESS and response capabilities. For example, species respond to \nclimate change earthquake recurrence rate and the next \ngeneration of ecological indicators. \nNASA uses advanced information systems to mature big \ndata capacity in order to support future Earth observation \nmissions. Firstly, the Earth information can be identified by \nNASA Climate Center. Secondly, it can further reduce the risk, \ncost size and development time of space-based and ground-\nbased information system in the Earth Sciences Department.\nFinally, it can also improve the accessibility and practicality of \nscientific data. NASA Earth science data and information \nsystem project has been active for more than 15 years. This \nproject aimed at archiving, processing and publishing Earth \nsatellite data, air and ground truth data, in order to ensure that nscientists and the public can access data from the Earth into \nspace, and enhance the ability to respond to climate and \nenvironmental change. NASA established the global Earth \nobservation system is an attempt of international cooperation to \nshare and integrate Earth observation data. It teamed up with \nthe U.S Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration and many other nagencies and countries. It has integrated satellite and ground-\nbased monitoring and modeling systems to assess \nenvironmental conditions and predict events \(such as forest \nfires, population growth and other natural or human \ndevelopment issues quality information in order to have a \nbetter understanding and find a better method to deal with the \nair quality impact on the environment and human health. \nNASA sets a space action agreement with Cray Company nwhich allows one or more projects cooperate around the \ndevelopment and application of low-latency big data system. \nNASA also uses the highly integrated non-SQL databases to \ntransfer data, in order to accelerate the modeling and analysis \nof software running to test the practicality of the hybrid \ncomputer system. NASA Planetary Data System is a planetary \nmission data archives, and has become the basic resources for nscientists all around the world, one of which is planetary \ndiscipline online catalog system, via which all products can be \npeer-reviewed, improved records and do access or queries. \nMultitasking archive of NASA Space Telescope Science \nInstitute is a part of the distributed space science data services \nwhich focuses mainly on 


the spectrum and other science-\nrelated data sets of optical, ultraviolet and infrared. It also \nprovides various astronomical data archives that supporting a \nvariety of tools to access. NASA Earth System Grid Federation \nis a public archives and cooperates with the U.S. Department of \nEnergy to provide observations and models for the Federal \n15\nGovernment. Word Wind, released by NASA is an open source \ngeographic science software, which shows the three \ndimensional Earth model provided by NASA, USGS, and other \nWMS vendor Through this software users can browse the \nhistorical image data, monitor disaster events by Modis data \nand dynamic monitor of global temperatures. \nIn addition, special mitigation satellites, remote sensing nsatellites, communication and navigation satellites have been \nwidely used in a variety of disaster management, such as \nearthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons \(hurricanes fire. Currently, Disaster Monitoring \nConstellation is a system that consists of satellites from various ncountries through international cooperation. This system has \nthese follow characteristics, high time resolution, large monitor \nrange and fast response. It can be widely used disaster \nreduction process and disaster mapmaking in floods, hurricanes \nand fires. \nII. SPACE DATA DISASTER\nSpatial data is closely related to human daily life, \npermeated all walks of life. The number, size and complexity \nare all in sharp increasing. A large amount of data has been \nstored in the spatial database and warehouse in types of text ngraphics, images and multimedia [5] [10] [11]. The research from \nInternational Data Corporation [26] has shown that, as of 2003 \nhumans have created a total of 5EB data, while in the year of \n2011, the amount of data that had been copied and produced is \nexceeded 1.8ZB. It is expected that by 2020 global data usage \nwill reach 35.2ZB, which needs 37.6 billion hard drives of 1TB \ncapacity to store. On the one hand these data broadens the \nscope of available spatial data available for human to gain \nwisdom. On the other hand the value of a single unit of the data \nis rapidly declining. Human is submerged by the data ocean but \nthirsty for knowledge. \nA. Garbage \nBig data is voluminous and it grows quickly, but it has very \nlow density in value which means there is a lot of junk data [4]\n[6]. The study on the electron-positron collider has been able to nshoot 40 million pictures per second, but only a few thousands \nare useful. Romania Internet security company BitDefender \npointed out that [6] spam and fishing information in the social \nnetwork game has increased by more than 50%. Compared to \nother online communication environment, social network users \nare more easily to unknowingly accept and load garbage \ninformation. \nBig data and applications are closely related, and nprofessional labeling of the data is the basic objective of \nrational analysis and sound judgment. Whether scientific \nexperimental data or observation data need to be labeled by \nexperts in the field [1] [3] [4 According to the IDC statistics [26],\nin 2012 only 23% of all information is useful, of which only 3% \nof potentially useful information had been labeled, and the \nproportion of data which had been analyzed is much less. With \nthe development of modern measuring technique and digital \nrecording method, in the face of huge information, traditional,\nartificial, experience elimination and analysis methods have \nbecome powerless. \nB Contamination \nSpatial data collected from the real world is contaminated \n[25] [26]. Moreover, as early as 1992, the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology found that data contamination problems are not \nisolated. In the 50 units and agencies that are sampled for the \nsurvey, most of the data accuracy is less than 95 Regardless \nof access to spatial data, there are some inevitable problems or \nerrors [28] [29] [30], such as contents incomplete, precision error, \ndata redundancy, format contradictory, different type, structure nuncertainties, different scales, different standard, outdated, \nerror exception, dynamic change and local sparse. Moreover \neach issue has a number of causes. For example, the noise can \nbe periodic noise, stripe noise, isolated noise and random noise. \nFurther, these data are often affected by gross errors, system nerrors and random errors individually or collaboratively. It is \nbound to damage the expected data accuracy if these three \nkinds of error cannot be correctly found and eliminated in the \nadjustment [11]. Some issues such as common incomplete, \ninaccurate, repeat, inconsistencies will be being emphasized in \nanalysis in the rest of this section.\nThere are a variety of causes lead to spatial data incomplete \n[11] [25] [27]. Omitting can cause data incomplete. For example, \nspatial attributes has not been fully collected, rules do not take ninfluence factors into account to edit spatial data, spatial \ndatabase cannot fully describe the characteristics, possible \ntarget may not all be contained in the spatial database. If the \ncharacteristics in the measurement standards are not defined \nand collected wholly in accordance with the guidelines, then \nthe characteristics to identify space target will be integrated \nbecause of assessment criteria. In addition, the lazy entry habit \nor different needs from different business departments should \nalso lead to the domain or record missing. \nInaccurate spatial data means incorrect value compared \nwith the reality of the physical attributes [28]. The causes of \ninaccurate spatial data includes the same spectrum image \ncomes from different objects, the same object is recorded in \ndifferent spectrum image, objective interpretation errors, fuzzy 


nobject boundaries, obsolete spatial data, incorrect calculation or \naggregation of spatial data, wrong data types, pseudo value, \ninterpretation errors of professional data, the strange format \nunable to understand and the encryption data cannot crack. \nDuplicate records means one real-world recorded is stored \nin a multi-source spatial data tautologically, or one real-world \ninformation is duplicated stored in multiple systems [11] [30].\nMany reasons can lead to duplicate records, such as multiple \ndata structures, name spelled wrongly, not commonly used \nalias, difference in acronym, vernacularize, difference in \nprecision, import low accuracy records from high accuracy \nrecords \(for example, import a 32-bit computer data from a 64-\nbit computer identifiers or strings. \nInconsistent spatial data [11] [25] [27] refers to the case that \nspace data context-related conflicts are caused by different \nsystems and applications on type, format, granularity nsynonyms, encoding, and so on. Inconsistencies caused by the \nintegration of spatial data from different sources may not meet \nthe following needs: the topology consistency among spatial \nentities, the internal consistency of the data structure, and the \n16\nlogical consistency of data specification. There are several ncauses of spatial data context-free conflict, such as accidental \ninput error, hardware or software failures spatial database state \nchanges caused by external factors, space data in the same \nsystem inconsistencies in different locations, units and time. It \nis difficult to find conversion functions in such cases, because \nthe representation and content is inconsistent due to the input is \nnot standardized. \nC. Difficult to use \nData is not only contaminated, but also difficult to use. The \nproduction, transmission, replication and accumulation of data \nhave gone far beyond people's capacity for analyzing, \nunderstanding and implementing Due to the large amount of \n"big data", it is difficult to collect, store, search, share, analyze \nand materialize. In general, human average daily reading time \nis usually 30 to 45 minutes, it can only browse a24-pages \nnewspaper. In fact facing the vastness of space remote sensing \ndata, the U.S. Department of Defense has no ability to fully \naddress the endless photos shot by reconnaissance satellites. \nThe new generation of “WorldView” satellite of the U.S. has \nspatial resolution of 0.5 meters. Its direct georeferencing\naccuracy can reach 2 to 3 meters. The new generation of \nexperimental satellite EO-1 has 220 imaging spectrums. The \nspectral range is 400 to 2500nm and it can gain the spectral \nresolution of 10 nm Spatial data database systems can \nimplement functions of data input, modify, statistics and query. \nBut it cannot find the knowledge behind the spatial data. The \nfocus of studying geographic information system is how to \nestablish a database, how to ensure the continuity of data for \nanalyzing, and how to develop the documentation editing \nsystem for the spatial data. But it is relatively weak to do deep-\nlevel processing of spatial data. Traditional theory and method \nof remote sensing image processing can process very limited namount of data in a low level of automation and intelligent. \nMost of the results stay on the level of qualitative. \nCommercial image processing software \(ERDAS, \nIMAGINE, PCI, ENVI, etc complete the \nfollowing mission: mix pixel, image match automatically, \ntarget extract automatically, and other automatic processing \nmission because the lack of new theories and methods. A \nnewspaper published the same article of the same author on\ntwo different pages of “legal community” and “youth topics”. \nAnother newspaper published three articles in the Edition of \n“home appliances”, “lifestyle” and “science and technology”, \nall to compare among VCD, CVD and DVD on the same day, \nand got three different conclusions, but the editor did not even \nrealize it. \nOver time, all walks of life are submerged by contaminated \ndata garbage, and then it could lead the big data into "garbage \nin, garbage out", and the “big data” becomes the useless “big \ngarbage”. Now, useful data is buried, and implied value is \nblanked in big data. On such a predicament, following \nproblems are the bottlenecks for big data research to break \nthrough: how to understand the spatial data, how to extract \ninformation from the data, how to turn data into knowledge can nbe available [23] [24], and finally how to realize the value of data. \nIII. THE VALUE OF SPATIAL DATA\nAdam Smith, a well-known Scottish economist, believed \nthat “useful things” can be treated as capital [31]. Data is nvaluable, and its value is in increasing via adaptive self-\nlearning. Spatial big data is collected from numerous and \ninterconnected sources. Real usefulness is its maximum value. \nThe generally accepted rule of big data is “decision on data”. \nThe first prerequisite is to keep data always useful and \nactivated. The ultimate value of big data is to gain human \nintelligence. \nA. Overall cognitive original appearance \nBig data provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe \nthe real world in a full view rather than partial samples 4] [17] [18].\nWithout big data, probability statistics can only be produced \nbased on random sampling from the real world, because space \ndata is constrained by collection, storage, computing and \ntransmission. Like the proverbial blind men grasping an \nelephant can only take a part for the whole, there is only a \nlimited view. Incomplete data sampling and sample data \ndispersion make it difficult to understand the overall trends 


or \nto notice the abnormal changes. \nNow, the incompleteness due to the information sampling \nis overcome, in the era of big data, in which data is being in \ncreating, copying and accumulating largely. All the data can\nreconstruct the real world mostly integrally in the information \nworld, describing a complete picture of space objects, stating \ngeneral laws and trends, thus to promote human understanding \nof the world and predicting the future more effectively. In \nrecent years, the United States have successfully utilized the nadvanced information technologies to forecast disaster events \ntimely with high accuracy. In particular the use of satellite \nnavigation and positioning technology can pinpoint the \nlocation of the disaster. For example, comparing the high-\nresolution satellite images of Galle city railway station \ncaptured before and after tsunami, helping us to interpret the \ndamage of building. In the Google Earth based Rainfall disaster nmonitoring system, users only need to simply call the Google \nEarth 3D terrain image,  superimposing the satellite cloud \nimages,  rainfall map, single station rainfall data, soil data, and \nlive pictures provided by the Bureau of Meteorology, and then \nwill get the three-dimensional visualization disaster effect, to nanalyze submergence and do decision-making. ArcGIS can \nproduce a variety of topics disaster map products ArcGIS \nMobile can meet the needs of disaster nowcast, and timely \ncollect all kinds of disaster thematic information. \nB. Basic resources \nMcKinsey [4] believes that data is the basic resource, and \ncan be compared with physical assets, human capital, create \nsignificant value for the world economy, improve the nproductivity and competitiveness of the enterprises and the \npublic sector, and create a large number of economic surplus \nfor consumers. In 2011, the World Economic Forum called big \ndata as new wealth. In 2012 the Davos Forum "Big Data, Big \nImpact" treated data as economic asset like currency or gold. In \n2012 Gartner believes that “Big data is big money”. The U.S. \ngovernment considers big data as “new oil” related to the \ncountry's economic restructuring and industrial upgrading [2] [3]. \n17\nIn the era of big data, the Google Earth presents a three-\ndimensional earth model through satellite images, aerial images, \nvector data and 3D models, to provide users with high-\nresolution satellite images, aerial images, and other licensed \npublic satellite images. The Baidu Map service provides not \nonly comprehensive map features \(such as the Search Tips nSearch vision, measurement, etc vivid and intuitive \nway. Users can either query the location of a street, shopping \nmalls, or the buildings or search for nearby place of interests,\nand suitable travelling routes for bus transfer, or driving nnavigation. The SoSo Maps produced by Tencent Company \nhave covered nearly 400 cities in the whole of China Similarly, \nusers can query the location of specific places, travelling plans,\nand driving navigations MAPWORLD has collected over 300 \nprefecture-level cities’ data, of which are 0.6-meter resolution \nsatellite remote sensing image, covering from whole China to \ncities, counties, towns, even villages. The data includes ndifferent detail levels of transportations, water systems, \nregional boundaries, administrative divisions residential areas, \nplace names, different resolution surface image, and three-\ndimensional terrain. In the 2010 earthquake in Yushu, the UAV \nimages with a resolution of 0.2 m have been used for \ndistribution planning, traffic jams monitoring and disaster \nassessing. \nOne important way to get value from the spatial data is to \nguide the data usage by the knowledge [4] [11]. For example, \nbecause the rank-defect process from two-dimensional to three-\ndimensional with remote sensing image data, quantitative \nresults cannot be directly obtained. With the help of human’s \nknowledge, interpreting and extracting remote sensing data can \nbe achieved automatically and intelligently. However, under \nthe circumstances of excessive spatial data, spatial knowledge \nseems quite poor. Because of the lack of knowledge from data \nand servicing for data utilization the value of resources data \ncontained is far from being adequately mined and utilized. \nIV. SPATIAL DATA MINING\nSpatial data mining refers to the basic technologies to \nrealize the value of big data, relocate data assets, and use it \neffectively. Spatial data mining can be used to extract \ninformation from data, mine knowledge from information, \nextract data intelligence in knowledge, improve the ability of \nself-learning self-feedback adaptation, finally realize human-\nmachine intelligence. \nA. Basic big data technology \nThe basic techniques of big data include data collection, \nstorage, processing, expression, and quality evaluation.  \nBig data can be generated in mobile devices, tracking \nsystems, radio frequency identification devices \(RFIDs archives, e-commerce, as well as the \nprocess in analyzing those data. The acquisition mode of big \ndata can be divided into three types: Point acquisition, plane \nacquisition, and mobile acquisition [11]. The point acquisition \nmeans collecting spatial coordinates and attributes of the \nsurface point-by-point through total station, GPS receivers and \nother conventional ground-based measurement. The plane \nacquisition means collecting images of large areas through air \nand space with remote sensing methods, to extract the \ngeometric and physical properties. The mobile acquisition \nmeans integrating the use of space positioning system 


n\(currently mainly refers to the Global Positioning System RS Systems \n\(GIS technology is the basis for data mining. It \nis designed to meet the growing need for data storage, which naims to provide scalability, high reliability, excellent \nperformance data storage, access, and management solution, \nsuch as distributed data storage, multiple levels caching, load \nbalancing, fault-tolerant mechanisms. Conventional methods \nare not adequate for these missions. It needs to establish a large \nplatform for data through software, to provide places to store \nand interface to access. In February 2012, researchers at the \nUniversity of York in UK developed a heat rather than the \nmagnetic field of computer hard disk data storage technology, \nthat reduces energy consumption while reach the storage speed \nof thousands of GB per second [32]. In October 2012, the \nFujifilm and IBM developed a barium ferrite particles coated\ntape, which can store 35TB data in the size of 10 cm * 2 cm [33].\nIn December, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology nsynthesized the third magnetic state herbertsmithite pure crystal, \nwhich may have a tremendous impact on magnetic storage \ntechnology [34]. \nBig data processing is to implement the transitions: from \ndata to information, from information to knowledge and from \nknowledge to wisdom. Big data processing includes object nsuperposition, target buffer, spatial data cleaning, spatial data \nanalysis, spatial data mining, spatial feature extraction, image \nsegmentation, and image classification. \nBig data expression technology is designed to represent the \ndata in a clear and effective way that reveals meaningful \ninformation to the user, or provide the user with a new \nperspective of view. Big data expression technology includes \ntriangulated irregular networks, digital elevation models, \ndigital terrain models, flat maps, three-dimensional maps nimage maps, and digital city maps. \nBig data quality assessment technology is aimed to avoid \nthe risk of big data collecting and high-density measuring. The \ntechnology includes logical assessment method, exception nvalue based assessment method, and accounting based \nassessment method. \nB. Discovery Spatial knowledge nSpatial knowledge discovery is the technology that uses \nspatial data mining method to extract previously unknown, \npotentially useful, and ultimately comprehensible rules. It is \nalso a process of gradual sublimation from spatial data to space \ninformation, and to space knowledge, step-by-step. Spatial data nmining systems aims to make spatial data gradually \nsummarized into spatial knowledge. Through the integration of \nspace data, it can deeply extract space knowledge. By using \nsuch new knowledge, data can be processed in real time in \norder to understand and apply the data, to make intelligent \njudgments and well-informed decisions. Space knowledge can \n18\nbe self-learning, self-enhance, universal, and easily recognized. \nIt could serve as a basis for decision support. \nIf businesses take full advantage of spatial knowledge, it \nwill be more precise and dynamic for humans to learn, work, \nlife, and achieve wisdom state. It will help to improve resource \nutilization and productivity level. Moreover, it will also help to \nrespond to the economic crisis, the energy crisis, the \ndeterioration of the environment and many other global issues nC. Extraction data intelligence \nData intelligence is the ability to obtain a more innovative, \nsystematic and comprehensive knowledge to solve a particular \nproblem through an in-depth analysis of the collected data It is \nan ability to understand and solve problems fast, flexibly and \ncorrectly. Spatial data intelligent has three features: more \nthoroughly perception, more extensive interoperability, and \ndeeper intelligence. The three features are aimed to get bigger \nand more comprehensive data,  to share and co-operate data via \nthe Internet, to do data analysis and data mining by variety of \nadvanced techniques, and to constitute a hierarchy of spatial \ndata intelligences \(Fig. 3   overlay \ndifferent data mining techniques, but a reasonable structure of \nindustry-oriented organization, good runner, and powerful \nwisdom system. The more reasonable industry structure \nbecome, the smaller internal friction got, the greater \neffectiveness got, and the higher wisdom system got. Every \ntime when a person interacting with the data he/she becomes \nmore efficient and more productive, which means it forms a\nbetter way to analyze, summarize, and calculate. Through the \nconsolidation and analysis of trans-regional trans-sector data, \nwith knowledge applied in specific industry, specific scenes \nand specific solution, big data intelligence can support \ndecision-making and action in a better way. For example, after \nthe attacks by Hurricane Katrina, in Louisiana and Mississippi, \nthe local electric power, telecommunications, roads and other \nlocal infrastructure have been destroyed, United States Coast \nGuard helicopter can still be able to use Global Positioning \nSystem \(GPS and analyze \nthrough equipment, \nsystems, and \nprocesses\nInformation, data \ninteroperability\nIntelligent decisions \nand actions\nAll the data on the \nEarth\nTransfer, share ,and \nCalculate Via  \nInternet\nAnalyze data by \nadvanced data \nanalysis and mining \ntechnology\nFigure 3. The hierarchy of spatial data intelligences \nMore in-depth data intelligence is to create new value of \ndata. On the one hand, when making full use of spatial 


data \nknowledge in all walks of life, it can produce secondary \nknowledge. In order to form a mining mechanism to mine \nknowledge in knowledge, it needs to bring primary knowledge \ntogether to form an intelligent form of expression. Ultimately, \nthe destination knowledge can be achieved. On the other hand, \nbased on a general industrial or socio-ecological system, it can \nredefine the interactive mode of government, companies and nindividuals, so that it improves the interaction clarity,\nefficiency, flexibility and response speed. It changes from the \ntraditional single dimension such as: production consumption, \nmanagement be management, or planning execution, to a new \nmulti-dimensional collaborative relationship. In this new \nrelationship, both individuals and organizations can freely \ncontribute and get information and expertise accurately and \ntimely This new relationship exerts a positive influence on \neach other to reach smart running macro-effects nSpatial data prompted the fusion of world's digital \ninfrastructure and physical infrastructure. Almost anyone or \nanything can be connected to a digital network at low-cost. It is \neasy to embed sensors in a variety of ecosystems. It can be \nmore sophisticated, dynamic management of production and \nlife to achieve the smart status, through global infrastructure of \nequipment and devices, via the integration of human society \nand the physical system by Internet, with supercomputers and \ncloud computing. For example, space knowledge can be found \nthrough integrating the data from satellite positioning systems, \nsensors, and wireless networks. , Spatial knowledge is then \ntransferred to the mobile phone terminal, which helps users nmake reasonable judgment based on location services in order \nto achieve the intelligent data transformation into wisdom \(Fig. \n4 spatial data from satellite positioning \nsystems, sensors and wireless networks. Secondly, the spatial \ndata is stored and managed by appropriate method, in order to \nintegrate into spatial information. Thirdly, a variety of spatial \nknowledge is extracted through purposefully data mining \nmethods and mining model. Spatial knowledge is integrated to \nthe new available knowledge, in order to reach deeper data \nintelligence. Finally data intelligence is integrated into the \ndigital earth and the "Internet of things", in order to enhance \nthe wisdom of users and machines, and to achieve smarter real \nworld data interaction. \nFigure 4. Location-based data intelligences \n19\nV. SPATIAL DATA EFFECTIVENESS\nWhen we possess the necessary knowledge and ability to ncontrol it, the data becomes our valuable asset that leads to \nmarket domination and huge economic returns The possible \nmodels include: rental data type, rental information type, \ndigital media type, data utilize type, data space operations type, \nand big data technology providers. The operators of rental data \ntype include: rental data of timeliness, extensive collection, and \ncarefully filtered. The operators of rental information type can \nearn profits in the complete industry chain, in the process of the \ndata collecting information extracting, and value delivering.\nThe operators of digital media type can get full use of the npredicting ability provided by big data, and then conduct \naccurate business. The operators of data utilize type conduct \nbusiness through efficient data analysis. The operators of data \nspace type conduct data resource services represented by \nnetwork storage. Big data technology providers use technology \nfor users processing structured, semi-structured and \nunstructured data. Big data applications are increasingly nInternet ubiquitous, rich interfaced, portalized, and fragmented. \nIt is a vertical integration in the application industry, therefore, \nbusiness that is closer to end-users, tends to have a larger \ninfluence in the industry chain \(Fig. 5 systems\nhave been developed for disaster mitigation and relief, which \nare based on GPS, RS, GIS, and the network communications \ntechnology. They are EMS in the U.S., MEMbrain in European, \nand DRS in Japan. They integrate emergency management \ntechnology and support decision-making. IBM developed the \nSahana Rescuers-Centered Disaster Reduction system through \nthe collaboration with the management of personnel ninformation, materiel, facilities and geographical information. \nThe efficiency of disaster relief and assistance is improved. \nSahana has provided its services in the following event the Sri \nLanka tsunami in 2005, the Pakistan earthquake in 2005, the \nUnited States hurricanes in 2005, the Southern Leyte mudslides \nin the Philippines in 2005, the Indonesia earthquake in 2006,\nand the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. \nBased on the facts stated above, McKinsey predicted [4], if \nwe can make full and effective use of the large big data, it can \nhelp global personal positioning service providers to increase \nthe income of 100 billion U.S. dollars The U.S. healthcare \nindustry can enhance 300 billion dollars output value a year, \nand save expenditures for medical care and public health by \nover 8%. The U.S. retail industry can grow more than 60% on\nthe net profit The U.S. manufacturing can reduce 50% on cost \nfor the equipment. The European governments can enhance the noutput value of 250 billion dollars a year by the enhancing the \npublic administration efficiency, and the developed economies \nin Europe will further save more than 100 billion euros. To this \nend a number of 140,000 to 190,000 specialized workers with \nthe ability of in-depth analysis, are needed only in the U.S. as \nwell as 


another 1.5 million proficient data managers. \nForbes said, “Big Data will soon become the norm and no \none tags a name on what is the norm [38]”. Morgan Stanley’s \nreport insists that “Big Data is soon to become Any Data [39]”. \nIn order to win the future, the rational choice is that “giving \ncustomers the technologies they need to store and analyze ‘any’ \ndata set – any type of data, any size of data, for any type of user, \nand in any timeframe.”\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe development of big data extends the scope of human \nactivities. It demands proper attention from academia, industry \nand government. The world has been cooperating and \nintegrating on a global scale. Human is enforced to change \nmode from the local to the global in their everyday life and \nwork It redefines the relationship among individuals, \nbusinesses, organizations, governments, and societies through \nnetworked thinking and further to improve the human living \nenvironment, to enhance the quality of public services, to \nimprove performance, efficiency and productivity through the \nintelligentized interactive operating. The technological \nprogress and industrial upgrading of big data will create new \nmarkets, new business models and new industry rules, and \nmore importantly it demonstrates the collective will of a ncountry that looking for strategic advantage. Although there is \nstill a large gap to gain data intelligence like human wisdom \nbig data is a promising topic and it certainly helps us to \nunderstand the world from an entirely new aspect. \nREFERENCES\n[1] United Nations Global Pulse, 2012, Big Data for Development: \nChallenges Opportunities [R], May 2012 \n[2] Office of Science and Technology Policy | Executive Office of the nPresident, 2012, Fact Sheet: Big Data across the Federal Government \n[R], March 29?2012?www.WhiteHouse.gov/OSTP \n[3] Office of Science and Technology Policy | Executive Office of the nPresident, 2012, Obama Administration Unveils ?Big Data?

The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
