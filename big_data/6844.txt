New demands for higher resolution multimedia applications such as UHD push for higher data rates to exceed 30Gbps. This high data rate demand requires short range standards to adopt a new approach to accommodate these rates. Millimeter wave enable high bandwidth usage which implies higher capacity to accommodate 10-100Gbps data rates However, the high data rate pose big challenges to both the system algorithm and architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel FPGA-based high-throughput beamforming MIMO system for millimeter wave short range communication. We present our first realization of a complete millimeter wave short range communication system, which includes RF frontend, ADC/DAC beamforming control, synchronization, channel estimation MIMO precoding/detection, and channel encoder/decoder. The design works at millimeter carrier frequency with 500MHz bandwidth and 2-channel MIMO Beamforming. We show realtime application test results as captured in the millimeter wave system Index Terms millimeter wave communication, beamforming MIMO, LDPC, baseband, OFDM, AGC, FPGA I  I NTRODUCTION  Short range wireless communication has been successfully adopted in a wide range of communication standards. Most of them are applied for home computing and entertainment where multimedia applications are main ly used. Recent advances of the multimedia applications suggest higher resolutions such as Ultra High Definition \(UHD\ that require higher data rates Many of these high throughput applications are currently migrating to wireless devices and mobile devices, which drive the demand for high throughput wireless link between them and with a very high resolution screen such as the UHD screen Millimeter wave band, 30GHz Ö 300GHz, allows high frequency bandwidths \(in GHz range\that can enable 10s of Gbps of capacity. This capacity can be used to wirelessly transfer compressed and uncompressed UHD resolutions of video between devices and screens. In addition, fast downloads cloud computing, and internet browsing can be easily achieved using these high rates. Due to the millimeter waves unique propagation characteristics  3 f  high pr op a g a t i o n loss and high reflection from objects such as buildings and walls they are a perfect fit for  indoor wireless communication. In addition, due to their small wavelengths between 1 mm to 10 mm, the form factor of the antenna system can be very small compared to conventional IEEE802.11n/ac [5 H z  ba nd antennas. With small antenna form factors the directivity of the Tx and Rx beams can be controlled by using smart antenna arrays enabling high-gain antennas. For indoor communication where the devices assume stationary to low mobility behavior directivity of the transmitter ante nna and the receiver antenna is crucial to achieve maximum power efficiency. Multiple standards were already formed to support Indoor/In-room wireless communication and specifically the 60GHz band with up to 10 meters distance and 7 Gbps data ra  suc h  a s  I E E E  802.15.3c [6 E  80 2.1 1 ad [7   a nd o t h e r s Ho w e ve r  in  these standards the spectral efficiency is low compared to others operating in lower frequency band \(e.g., IEEE802.11ac [5 Increasing the data rates to support higher rates such as 30 Gbps can be achieved in multiple ways such as increasing the modulation scheme \(above 64 QAM\, increasing bandwidth above 2GHz\, or MIMO schemes. Note, each one of these options and definitely any combination of the three pose a big challenge to the Antenna/RF and baseband systems in the transmitter side as well as in the receiver side. In this work we present a new revolutionary wireless communication system that enables high bandwidth millimeter wave together with MIMO and beamforming The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we give a quick overview of the system, in Section III we describe in detail the MI MO beamforming transceiver, in Section IV real-time over the air test results are shown, and we conclude the paper in Section V.

   Figure 2  A novel millimeter wave MIMO beamforming OFDM transceiver \(2-user example II  S YSTEM O VERVIEW  In this section we explain the millimeter wave MIMO system. This system uses transmit and receive beamforming to overcome the unfavorable propagation characteristics of millimeter waves, achieve highe r energy efficiency \(lower energy per bit\, and provide higher spatial channel order. The access point \(AP\erves several sub-sectors \(called slices Each slice corresponds to a beam and is outlined by a synchronization channel \(SCH\. Similarly, the user equipment UE\ also has multiple slices \(see Figure 1\. In this millimeter wave MIMO system, the AP-to-UE-link and the UE-to-AP-link are time multiplexed, and each direction carries data and control information to such as beam training results and channel parameters for optimizing the link throughput The system can be configured in different ways based on the required data rate and the number of frequency bands. The AP in the MIMO frequency-division multiple access \(FDMA mode, can support simultaneous AP-to-UE-links, each UE on a different band. Multiple data streams can be sent to the user over spatially separated beams.  Alternatively, in the SingleBand Space-Division Multiple Access \(SDMA\ Mode, the AP can serve multiple users on the same band by using simultaneous beams separated in space. In a third mode, MultiBand MIMO Mode with Carrier Aggregation, the AP serves multiple UEs over aggregated bands. Here we assume that the aggregated bands can be supported by the same antenna array The AP has multiple antenna arrays with MIMO precoding across the arrays III  MIMO  B EAMFORMING S YSTEM B LOCK D IAGRAM  The System block diagram is shown in Figure 2. The AP has multiple \(two\ antenna arrays, each consisting of several two\ub-arrays, and each sub-array is driven by one digital chain. The elements of the same antenna array are closely spaced \(e.g., half wave length apart\, while the elements of the different antenna arrays are several wave lengths apart. The antenna elements are connected to digital phase shifters, which are controlled by the beamforming processor in the baseband to form different radio frequency beams. The UE is similar to the AP, but usually has fewer antenna arrays and antenna elements The transceiverês baseband \(BB\ includes LDPC encoder/decoder, M-QAM modulator/demodulator, MIMO precoder/detector, Sync, AGC, and IFFT/FFT. Novel algorithms and optimized architectures were developed to enable high data-rate transmission A  System Structure and Numerology We will explain first the structure of the baseband system The system is Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM\ based and the numerology is described in Table I TABLE I. mmWave OFDM system numerology mmWave OFDM Configuration System Bandwidth \(MHz 500  Sampling rate \(MHz 552.96  Subcarrier spacing \(KHz 270  OFDM symbol length \(FFT size 2048  No. of useful subcarriers 1728 Total Guard band \(MHz 86 OFDM symbol duration \(us 3.70  CP length 512  CP duration \(us 0.93  Slot duration \(us 125  Number of OFDM symbols per slot 27  Subframe duration \(ms 1  Number of slots per subframe 8  Frame duration \(ms 10  Number of subframes per frame 10  Superframe duration \(ms 40  Number of frames per superframe 4   The system is multi-band with 500MHz bandwidth per band Each band is divided into 2048 subcarriers with 270KHz of subcarrier spacing and total of 86 MHz guard band between             The 11th Annual IEEE CCNC- Wireless Communications Track 538 


  bands to support simple analog image rejection filters between bands. Therefore we assume in our system only 1728 useful subcarriers. The baseband system is sampled at 552.96 MHz and the Cyclic Prefix \(CP\ is 0.25 of the symbol \(0.93 us duration. Shorter CPs can be applied depending on the InterSymbol Interference \(ISI\f the channel. The symbols are grouped into slots \(125 us\here there are 27 symbols per slot The slots are grouped into subframes \(1 ms\There are 8 slots per subframe where one slot is synchronization slot and one is reserved for Reverse Link \(Uplink\. The rest of the 6 slots per subframe are used for Forward Link \(Downlink\. The subcarriers are centered around the carrier frequency \(\(-864\o\(-1\ and 1-to-864\270KHz\.   The system described below is an enhancement to the system described in [8 en a b lin g  Tim e  Division Duplex \(TDD\O beamforming for short range communication B  Beam Selection and Sync hronization Channel \(SCH The Synchronization Channel \(SCH\ is responsible for slice identification, beam selection, timing, and frequency synchronization. There are two types of SCH, one for Forward Link \(DSCH\ and one for Reverse Link \(USCH As described in [8 o r w a r d Link Sy nc hr o n iza t i o n  Channel is sent by the AP over the first slot of the subframe. In our system the DSCH occupies only 256 subcarriers out of the 2048 that are centered around the carrier frequency. As explained above, the DSCH is primarily used for timing synchronization of the UEs in Forward Link so each UE will sync its received subframes, slots and symbols based on the detected DSCH. The DSCH is also used for Slice Identification Slice-ID\ a unique Zadoff-Chu \(ZC\ Slice-ID sequence is used for different AP slice. The DSCH sends each AP Slice-ID sequence on different OFDM symbol in the Sync slot occupying only the even subcarriers. For example, as described in Figure 3, with four AP slices, DSCH spans on four consecutive\DM symbols with Z 1  Z 2  Z 3 and Z 4 ZC SliceID sequences with corresponding transmission through four slices, respectively. In order to guarantee the fastest synchronization by the UE at any point of time, similar approach as the cyclic prefix is proposed, the first symbol in the DSCH is copied and added to the end of DSCH. By doing this AP transmits DSCH with 5 OFDM symbols as Z 1  Z 2  Z 3  Z 4  and Z 1 for the first subframe. In the following subframes, the AP transmits the DSCH with Z 2  Z 3  Z 4  Z 1 and Z 2 and so on In each UE, after detecting one or more DSCH symbols the AP Slice-ID is determined by correlating the received DSCH symbol with all the reference DSCH symbols of all the AP Slice-IDs \(known by the UEs\ and finding out the maximum one The same method is used in the reverse link \(Uplink\ from the UE to the AP using the USCH channel in the Uplink slot period \(Figure 3\. However, there may be multiple UEs that send their sync sequences, channel information and data to the AP and they all use the same Uplink slot. Therefore, the Uplink slot is divided into multiple Time Division Multiplexing\ TDM sub-slots. Each UE in the system is assigned with either a single or multiple sub-slots to transmit its USCH sequence, channel information and data to the AP The division between the UEs in the Uplink slot can be also done in FDM within a symbol \(divide the subcarriers between the UEs\ or any combination between the two multiplexing methods. In the following section we will continue and describe the beam pairing procedure between the AP and UE  Figure 3  Synchronization channel between AP and UE C  Beam Pairing The UE receives the DSCH Slice-ID sequences from different AP slices in the Sync slot period through a certain Rx beam \(see Figure 3\ce the UE detects a DSCH Slice-ID sequence from one or more AP slices, it compare it to the previous detected IDs within the same Rx beam period \(1 ms and selects the slice with highest correlation value as described in Figure 3. Then the UE can change its own Rx beam and repeat the process described above for the new Rx beam. Each Uplink slot the UE can send back the AP its best received AP Slice-ID in its USCH assigned location in the Uplink slot period. The UE compare each subframe the best AP Slice-ID energy with the current AP Slice-ID energy and can decide whether to ask for AP slice change or keep the previous AP slice. The AP can use the corresponding slice to send data to this particular UE. If the AP doe s not detect any Slice-ID in the USCH, then it assumes that this particular UE does not require any change of slice. However, the AP can decide to keep the previous slice and not change the slice as instructed by the UE until a certain number of subframes are passed and the UE does not request to change Slice-ID within this time. The same is done for all the UEs; each can send its best AP Slice-ID back to the AP in its location in the Uplink slot. A multi-stage beam pairing algorithm is proposed. Once the best AP Slice-ID is determined by both the AP and UE, a second set of narrower AP beams within the best slice can be used with same or different Slice/Beam-IDs respectiv ely, instead of the slices and Slice-IDs used on the first stage. The quality of the link can be significantly improved in a second stage by scanning a set of narrower beams within that selected slice in similar procedure and so on for next stages. Then the data is transmitted on the paired narrow beams Although it is straightforward for both transmitter and receiver to scan all combinations of transmission and receiving beams to find out the strongest beam direction, this direct scanning is a very time consuming and not energy efficient For example, in each round, the transmitter fixes its beam at one transmission direction, and the receiver scans all receiving directions. This whole procedure in total uses SCH OFDM symbols to scan all combinations, where q is the number of  The 11th Annual IEEE CCNC- Wireless Communications Track 539 


  narrow beams in each sector \(assuming same number of antennas per sector in both Tx and Rx sides The multi-stage beam pairing approach, proposed in this paper, tremendously reduces the number of required SCH OFDM symbols to complete the beam pairing, which is much suitable for our short range communication. The pairing approach is based on successive approximation method. In the first stage, the receiver and transmitter use a wide beam, or slice, each covering  narrower beams. The receiver and transmitter can detect the strongest beam directions for this wide beam in OFDM symbols. Then the receiver and transmitter switch to  narrower beams to scan inside that strongest wider beam. This takes another  OFDM symbols to find out the strongest beam direction for the narrower beam. And so on for  where   till beams left. In total, this algorithm uses  OFDM symbols. The total  OFDM symbols required for beam pairing is much smaller than the straightforward approach of OFDM symbols described above. It is also smaller than the 2-stage approach [8 i th 2 q OFDM symbols for  and equal for  This algorithm can be ge neralized to any number of antennas in either side. In the case where the Tx has q  antennas per sector and Rx has m antennas per sector, the total number of OFDM symbols required is         Other sub-optimal methods can be applied as well. In addition, in case where the energy difference between two AP/UE slices/beams pairs is be low a certain threshold, the decision can be postponed to later stages by increasing the number of OFDM symbols involved in the beam pairing, or to keep the decision based on current beam pairing. For example if the current beam pairing is part of one of the candidate group of beams with smaller difference than the threshold, then it will be also the surviving group After finding the best beam pair, the scanning still keeps running each subframe to track any changes due to movements and obstructions. Once a better quality pair is found, the AP and UE will update the recorded pair for data transmission. In the next section we describe how the beams are formed and the gain is controlled D  Analog Beamforming & AGC Control In order to allow both the AP and the UE to form their beams with different angles, the antenna consists of an array of elements. Each antenna element is fed by different phase shifts of the RF modulated signal. Each antenna element can also have its own Power Amplifier \(PA\. In our system there is only one PA per antenna array. The phase shifts for the antenna arrays and all other RF configuration such as Variable Gain Amplifiers \(VGAs\, T/R switch, PLL control, PA gain, LNA gain and other controls are digitally configured and provided by the Baseband platform. In the Baseband platform there are predefined configurations for the different beams and beam widths. In addition, for proper beam selection, it is important to set the signal power at the receiver input of the analog-todigital converter \(ADC\or each beam pair to a fixed value which will use the maximum ADC dynamic range. This is achieved by adjusting the VGAs in the UE Rx RF unit. The VGA adjustment is done by the AGC algorithm running at the UE baseband. AGC adjusts the gain of the RF VGAs according to the received power E computed in the synchronization module  The AGC control mechanism that varies the VGA gain based on the received signal energy can also be a good indication for the received beam signal reliability. The higher the gain required from the VGA by the AGC control mechanism the smaller the received signal energy which indicates the received beam signal to noise ratio is low which leads to low signal integrity. Hence, high energy received beams which require low VGA gain indicate strong beam energy. Figure 4 describes the AGC gain control decision  Figure 4  AGC Scheme For OFDM systems as described in Figure 4, we assume 20 dB head room for Peak-to-Average Power Ratio \(PAPR fading and beam forming variations. Signal target is set at 32.5 dB above ADC noise floor At system initialization \(or loss of sync\, the front end attenuators are set to their mi nimum value. This setting is advantageous to the capture of weak signals and provides consistent capture and initialization for the expected worst case conditions. The DSCH must be reliably received in order to maintain timing at the receiver Once the DSCH has been captured, power estimates of the pilot symbol are used by the AGC algorithm to determine the required adjustment of the front end attenuators. Power estimates greater than 37.5 dBm above the noise floor increase the front end attenuators. Power estimates below 32.5 dBm above the noise floor decrease the front end attenuators. Power estimates between 32.5 and 37.5 dBm do not change the attenuators Loss of the DSCH can occur and if the duration of the loss is greater than 1 sec, the AGC algorithm resets the front end attenuators to their minimum value to acquire the sync signal again E  Channel estimation After pairing the transmitter and the receiver beams, setting the AGC levels, syncing the time-domain received signal and transforming it to frequency-domain through FFT, the MIMO channel can be estimated through th e pilot bits sent in selected symbols for both the transmitters The 11th Annual IEEE CCNC- Wireless Communications Track 540 


  In the transmitter, pilots from each transmission chain are first interleaved in the frequency domain, and then are inserted into the OFDM every 6 subcarrier s. At the receive ith the received pilot, the corresponding channel coefficient  in the channel matrix for subcarrier j is estimated by using least square estimator where is the reference pilot for subcarrier j from transmitter chain n to the receiver chain m  is the received pilot. The estimated channel coefficients are then linearly interpolated to compute the channel coefficients of the subcarriers without pilot for each channel \(frequency-domain estimation\. In addition, linear time-domain estimation is performed for matching sub-carriers in neighboring symbols symbols Besides the channel coefficients, complex noise variance is also estimated in the channel estimator. This is computed by calculating the signal energy on the guard band \(in place of non-existent sub-carrier F  MIMO detection With the estimated channel matrix and noise variance the a posterior i probab ility APP\ detector calculates log-likelihood ratio \(LLR L of bit k as described in   perf or m i ng  maxLogAPP approximation, LLR computation is reduced to  1 1 1 1 1 min      2 1  min      2 k k T k xX T xX L           yHxC yHx yHxC yHx  2  where  means the sets of  and  means the sets of   C is the covariance matrix By assuming the received signals are independent from each other, in our 2x2 MIMO receiver, we further reduce the complexity of the first term 1 1 min     k T xX     yHxC yHx to  1   1 11 2 21 1 1 12 2 22 2 22 22 12 12   1 2 11 12 21 22 22 12 11 11 min 2   2    11  2    k xX yh yh x yh yh x xx hh h h           3 where  is the real part of a complex number indicates the conjugate of  is the element in row i and column j of the channel matrix is noise variance for receiver chain i  The same simplification is also performed to the other term  1 1 min     k T xX     yHxC yHx  4    The MIMO detection block is divided into 3 pipelined subblocks: the ML computation shared for the two channels, the Norm calculation for all possible combinations \(16 combinations for 2x2 MIMO QPSK\d the Log-Likelihood Ratio \(LLR\ computation that finds the minimum distance of all combinations and output LLR info to the channel decoder G  Channel Coding Due to the fading characteristics of the MIMO channel, the system requires also a strong channel coding in order to correct any errors introduced by the channel. Like other connectivity standards such as IEEE802.11n/ac/ad, the proposed MIMO beamforming system incorporates Low Density Parity Check LDPC\ coding. The transmitted raw data is first LDPC encoded in the transm itter. The LDPC code is a block code and similar to IEE802.11ad, we define the block size of the LDPC to be an exact division of the number of useful subcarriers. From Table I, the number of useful subcarriers per symbol is 1728. Hence, we defined the basic LDPC block size to be 1728/4 = 432 bits and we designed two lifting factor hierarchies that construct the 1728-bit H-Matrix as in h e LDPC code is based on a 432-bit block with Z=27 lifting factor. A higher level Z p 4 lifting factor interleaves four blocks of 432-bits. Figure 5 shows the LDPC R=1/2 H-Matrix based on these two lifting factors. The R=1/2 code is four-layer decodable with four independent row pairs which means that the LDPC decoder processing can be divided into two parallel machines each support four-layer decoder. Hence, in the receiver, the MIMO-detected LLR values are fed into the LDPC decoder that supports the required data rate  Figure 5  1728-bit LDPC code H-Matrix Figure 6 shows the LDPC decoder block diagram. We use the layered decoding algorithm for reducing the amount of required memory and reducing the number of iterations. For higher throughput with low complexity, the decoder is implemented with 8-bit LLR precision   Figure 6  LDPC Decoder structure As enabled by the code depicted in Figure 5 with Z p 4  four LDPC decoders using the Base Code from Figure 5\(a simultaneously process four sub-codes of N=432 comprising the full 1728-bit block. However, to support the data throughput of 1.52 Gbps, only one 432-bit decoder is required  The 11th Annual IEEE CCNC- Wireless Communications Track 541 


  H  RF/BB Interface The RF/BB interface, shown in Figure 7, consists of two parts: signal and control.  The signal path between the RF and BB units is passing through digital-to-analog converters DACs\ in the Tx signal path and analog-to-digital converters ADCs\ in the Rx signal path. The BB transceiver platform supports four High Speed FMC connectors. Each FMC connector supports a module with dual channel 16-bit DAC \(I and Q\d dual channel 12-bit ADC \(I and Q\he sampling frequency of the ADC/DAC modules is 552.96MHz. The ADC/DAC clock is derived by the RF unit \(1105.92MHz with FMC board internal division by 2 The control interface allows the BB unit to control the operating parameters of the RF unit, including phased-array beamforming and beamwidth, PA gain, LNA gain, VGA gain and RF attenuation. The physical connection of the RF control is through an HDMI cable connected between the BB ADC/DAC module and the RF unit The system also provides a method for directly controlling the RF unit without the BB unit.  This method of control uses a PC connected to the RF unit using a USB port.  The PC can control all of the same RF parameters as the BB unit. PC-based control can be implemented using a graphical user interface GUI\ running on the PC, or by software which automates the functions such as beamforming and gain control.  We use the PC-based control to test calibrate, and analyze the performance of the RF units  Figure 7  RF/BB Interface Figure 8 shows the RF unit control interface. An FPGA module integrated in the RF unit provides the two methods of control previously described BB unit control via HDMI cable and PC control via USB port\ The FPGA dispatches the control commands to the corresponding RF components within the RF unit        Figure 8  RF/BB I/F Block diagram I  Multiple Antenna configurations As said above, the system can be configured in different ways: FDMA, SDMA, or multi-band MIMO mode. To support these modes, the AP is equipped with  antenna arrays Each antenna array consists of  sub-arrays where each sub-array is connected via digital chain to the baseband. The UE, however, is equipped with only one antenna array, which consists of  sub-arrays. Note, each sub-array is capable of forming an analog narrow beam to transmit data. Also, each antenna arrays has bandwidth that covers all supported bands in the system \(this is practically achievable in mmWaves band In the FDMA mode, the AP can support up to min   number of bands\ UE simultaneously, and each UE can has up to min    spatial streams. The AP serves each UE on a separate antenna array and frequency band. In the SDMA mode the AP can support up to   UEs simultaneously where up to  UE can share the same frequency and time resource, but only separated spatially by different analog beams Similar to the FDMA mode, in the SDMA mode, each antenna array transmits signal in only one frequency band. Finally, in the Multi-band MIMO mode, each user can be served on aggregated bands with up to  streams. In this mode, an antenna array can transmit signal on multiple frequency bands concurrently IV  R EAL T IME T EST R ESULTS  Indoor over-the-air tests are performed on the final integrated system with AP and UE. Each side has 28GHz RF unit, 552.96MHz ADC/DAC, and baseband running on FPGA 8 T h e b a s i c d e s i gn ca n r u n up t o  1  52 Gbp s o n tw o  X i linx Virtex-6 FPGAs of the multi-FPGA system. The system is partitioned into a few clock domains to maximize the throughput of each separate module. The receiver on Virtex-6 FPGAs uses 98168 Slices, 279361 LUTs, 79387 Registers, and 212 DSP48s. The system is scalable to support the desired throughput. An SDMA MIMO system was demonstrated in the lab as shown in Figure 9. A real time dual video transmission was sent from the AP to the 2 UEs. The video application software at the AP sends uncompressed video packets. The video frame at the transmitter PC is packetized and sent via Gigabit Ethernet using the WinP cap API to the AP Baseband Tx FPGA where the video packets are transformed into an OFDM BB signal which sent to the Tx RF unit that transmit the two videos in two separate beam s. After beam pairing process each receiving endpoint UE, captures the incoming beam and down converts the RF signal to BB OFDM, The UE Rx BB FPGA sync, demodulates and decodes the data and generates the recovered video packets which are then sent over the Gigabit Ethernet to the corresponding Rx PC. The depacketization process in the Rx PC assembles the packets as a frame and renders it using DXVA 2.0 hardware acceleration Figure 10 describes the Error Vector Magnitude \(EVM\ test results done on the mmWave Tx/Rx RF units. The measured EVM for full Tx/Rx RF units with 500MHz OFDM QPSK modulation was -19 dB at distance of 10 m. The OFDM signal shown in Figure 10 included 1728 useful subcarriers between 233.28 MHz at 552.96 MHz sampling frequency. From Figure 10 it can be seen that due the RF/IF frequency response, there     The 11th Annual IEEE CCNC- Wireless Communications Track 542

Table II describes the corresponding LDPC decoder performance once synthesized and implemented in TSMC 65nmLP process. We can see that at high rates \(3/4 and 13/16\ingle LDPC decoder block can easily surpass 1 Gbps with low power consumption of only 60 mw which implies that the total decoding power consumption to support higher date rates, for example 10 Gbps, should not exceed 300 mw in TSMC 65nmLP process. Smaller dimension processes such as 32nm, and 28nm should reduce the power consumption even more  TABLE II. ASIC Throughput and power consumption of the LDPC code decoder   Figure 11 describes the LDPC decoder performance at different rates and modulation scheme. It is shown in Figure 11 that the 16-QAM is worse than the QPSK by 6 dB. In addition the Rate=3/4 LDPC code is worse than Rate=1/2 code by 3 dB Because of the huge complexity of the system, the current receiver is partitioned onto 2 FPGAs, one for LDPC decoder and the other for all other modules. The data are transferred between them through 6.6 Gbps GTX transceivers. The expected overall throughput of our integrated design can reach 1.52 Gbps for the uncoded data. With the rate-13/16 LDPC code, this corresponds to 1.235 Gbps information bit rate. The maximum clock frequency in FPGA LDPC module is 28.8MHz, and the throughput is 1.61 Gbps  Figure 11  Performance of the 1728-bit Quasi-Cyclic LDPC decoder over AWGN channel V  C ONCLUDING R EMARKS  In this paper, we presented algorithms and architectures to realize high-data rate millimeter wave MIMO communication system.

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
