These main challenges are maintaining data \nconfidentiality, enforcing fine-grained data access control, \napplying efficient user revocation mechanism, preventing the \ncollusion between users to access unauthorized digital objects, \nachieving scalability and possessing generic construction \ndesirable feature In addition, the proposed system avails \ndigital passport which is presented by the user to be granted \naccess to any digital object in the cloud environment. The \nusage of digital passport minimizes the number of transactions \nneeded to authenticate the specified user. Moreover, the digital \npassport simplifies the data management for users since the \nuser has to keep his passport only to use it to access the cloud nFurthermore, the digital passport prevents a rejoined user who \npossesses different attributes to access his previously \nauthorized data. Additionally, the digital passport prohibits \nthe collusion between an authorized user and a revoked one to \nown the access privileges once assigned to the revoked user. \nThe proposed system exploits public key infrastructure \(PKI nperformance and to secure the transmission of private data as \nwell as defending man in the middle attack. It should be noted \nthat the implementation of the proposed system has showed the \nsystem computational validity nKeywords: Attribute Based Encryption; Proxy Re-encryption; \nPublic Key Infrastructure; Cloud Computing; \nI INTRODUCTION  \nCloud computing definition according to the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology NIST a shared pool of configurable \ncomputing resources \(e.g., networks, servers, storage, \napplications, and services interaction” [1]. Moreover, three categories of cloud \ncomputing services have evolved over the recent years which \nare software-as-a-service \(SaaS PaaS IaaS end users over the internet. While \nplatform-as-a-service category can be described as collection \nof tools and means to facilitate developing and deploying \ndifferent applications. Finally, infrastructure-as-a-service ncategory affords the needed infrastructure hardware and \nsoftware including servers, storage, networks, and operating \nsystems.  \nOne of the popular services within infrastructure-as-a-\nservice category is cloud storage service which is usually \ncalled storage-as-a-service. Storage-as-a-service can be \ndefined as an online storage offered by a service provider \nand is accessed via the web on a non-persistent network nconnection. The usage of storage-as-a-service for sharing \ndigital objects on both personal and professional levels has \nbeen rapidly growing over the last few years. Storage-as-a-\nservice has many advantages such as high availability, data \nbackup and recovery tools and instant addition of extra \nstorage if needed based on pay for what you use” model. \nHowever, storage-as-a-service turns the control of data from \nthe data owner to the cloud service provider. In this paper, \nthe cloud service provider is considered honest but curious \nsuch that it manages the user data, process user access \nrequests and handle other administrative tasks honestly but \ntries to figure out as much secret information as possible \nbased on the inputs. The existence of such architecture and \nassumptions has raised main challenges which are: \n• Maintaining data confidentiality: The digital objects \nhave to be kept encrypted on the service provider \nstorage servers and only the authorized users can \ndecrypt them. \n• Enforcing fine-grained data access control: The data \nowner must be able to assign fine-grained data access \nlevels for different users. \n• Applying efficient user revocation mechanism: The nrevocation mechanism must not enforce the cloud to \npossess information relevant to the revoked users or the nrevocation process i.e. stateless cloud. In addition, the \nrevocation mechanism should not require re-encryption \nof digital objects or generation of new keys for the \nexisting users. \n• Collusion resistance The system has to prevent the \ncollusion between users to access unauthorized digital \nobjects. In addition, a rejoined user who possesses \ndifferent attributes must not be able to access his \npreviously authorized data Moreover, the collusion \nbetween an authorized user and a revoked one to own \nthe access privileges once assigned to the revoked user \nmust be prohibited. \n2013 International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data\n978-1-4799-2829-3/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.21\n1530 9 4 31 4\n• Achieving 


scalability: The system procedures have to be \nindependent of the number of users and the size of the \ndigital objects.  \n• Possessing generic construction desirable feature: The \nsystem has to be independent of the underlying \ntechniques used. This allows for a tailored choice of the \nsuitable techniques based on the domain requirements \nwhere the system will be implemented. \nMany schemes using attribute based encryption \(ABE nand/or proxy re-encryption \(PRE exploiting storage-\nas-a-service for sharing digital objects [2-7].  \nDi Vimercati et al. [2] have tried to realize the challenge \nof enforcing fine grained access control. Unfortunately, the \ncomplexity of operations required during file creation and \nuser grant/revocation is linear to the number of users, which \nmakes the scheme not scalable [3].  \nIn addition, Yu et al. [3] have proposed data access \ncontrol system to realize the challenges of fine-grained data \naccess control, data confidentiality and scalability, in cloud \nenvironments However, the proposed scheme requires the \ncloud to be stateful which is not a desired feature [4]. \nMoreover the proposed system failed to realize the \nchallenge of efficient user revocation mechanism. Since, the nproposed revocation scenario requires the data owner to re-\ngenerate and update the secret keys for all the users except \nfor the one to be revoked. Furthermore, the proposed \nrevocation scenario requires the re-encryption of all the \naffected files using the new generated secret keys. \nFor the sake of achieving the challenge of enforcing fine-\ngrained data access control without the need of key-\nredistribution or data re-encryption in case of user \nrevocation, Yang and Zhang in [4] have proposed a generic \nscheme. However, the proposed scheme is not competent in \ndealing with the scenarios that a revoked user rejoins the \nsystem and is authorized with different access privileges. In \naddition, collusion between a revoked consumer and an nauthorized consumer helps the two entities possess the access \nprivileges once assigned to the revoked consumer [4]. \nSamanthula et al. [5] have proposed efficient and secure \ndata sharing framework using homomorphic encryption to \nachieve the challenge of enforcing fine-grained data access \ncontrol with preventing the leakage of unauthorized data. \nHowever, the data owner has to generate an authorization \ntoken for each user per each record the specified user has \naccess to it. This brings heavy computational cost to the data \nowner who is assumed to have limited hardware resources. \nIn addition, the proposed revocation mechanism requires the \ncloud to scan the authorization token list per each record to \nremove the revoked user from it \(if found authorization token to every record the specified user \nhas access to it. This hinders the framework scalability and \nincurs heavy burden to the cloud. The heavy burden to the \ncloud is not desirable feature as in many charge modes the \nlower the computation overhead, the lower the financial cost \nto the user nConcerning the aim of accomplishing the challenge of \nenforcing fine grained access control and flexible revocation \nmechanism, Eissa and Gi-Hwan in [6] have proposed a \nscheme for data security on public cloud storage services. \nHowever, the proposed scheme requires the data owner to \ngenerate proxy re-encryption key for each user per each file \nupon the first access request from the specified user. In \naddition, the proposed revocation scheme necessitates the \ndata owner to update the proxy re-encryption key for each \nfile every revocation process. This produces heavy workload \nto the data owner and hinders the proposed scheme nscalability. Moreover, the proposed scheme permits the \ncollusion between users to possess the appropriate policy \nnodes to access a file none of the authorized users is \nauthorized to access individually Furthermore, the proposed \nscheme lacks the desirable feature of generic construction as \nit depends on key policy attribute based encryption. \nFinally, Nabeel et al. [7] have formalized a new key \nmanagement scheme for content sharing in public clouds to \nsolve the drawbacks of using attribute-based encryption \nand/or proxy re-encryption. However, the proposed scheme \nnecessitates the data owner to re-encrypt all involved sub-\ndocuments when adding a new user or revoking an existing \none. This hinders the scheme scalability since it adds high \ncomputational cost to the data owner. In addition, the \nproposed scheme permits the collusion between users to \nderive the group key needed to access sub-documents none \nof them is permitted to access individually. \nTherefore, it is clear from the above discussion that the \nmentioned schemes [2-7] have failed to afford \ncomprehensive solution to achieve the mentioned challenges \nas illustrated at “Table I”.  \nIn this paper, a generic, scalable and fine-grained data \naccess system that realizes the main challenges which nhinder the growth of using storage-as-a-service for sharing \ndigital objects offered by honest but curious cloud \nenvironments is presented. The system encapsulates flexible \nand yet convenient realization for all of the mentioned \nchallenges. In addition, the proposed system avails digital \npassport which is presented by the user to cloud to grant \nhim access to any digital object.  \nThe proposed user digital passport reduces the number \nof transactions needed to permit the access of the specified \nuser. Moreover, the digital passport facilitates the data \nmanagement for users since the user has to only retain his \npassport to use it to access 


the cloud. Furthermore, the \ndigital passport prohibits a rejoined user who owns different \nattributes to access his previously authorized data. \nAdditionally, the digital passport prevents the collusion \nbetween an authorized user and a revoked one to possess the \naccess privileges once assigned to the revoked user. The nproposed system exploits public key infrastructure \(PKI enhance system \nperformance, to help in achieving scalability, to secure the \ntransmission of private data and to defend man in the middle \nattack. \n \n16\nTABLE I.  MAIN CHALLENGES ACHIEVED BY PREVIOUS SCHEMES \n \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section \n\(II blocks \nis elaborated. Section \(III IV and discussion. \nSection \(V VI accomplishments done. \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe essential building blocks of the proposed system are nattribute-based encryption \(ABE PRE PKI section, a \nquick overview of the proposed system building blocks will \nbe discussed. \nThe first building block of the proposed system is ABE. \nABE is a public key cryptography technique initially \nproposed to allow for a certain amount of error tolerance in \nidentity based encryption \(IBE  receiver to decrypt an encrypted message using his \nprivate key  d d quantitative \nthreshold value [26]. It should be noted that ABE techniques \nhave evolved into two categories which are key-policy \nattribute based encryption \(KP-ABE CP-ABE 26]. While in CP-ABE, attributes are used \nto describe a user’s credentials and access policies are nassociated with encrypted data to determine the authorized \nidentities to decrypt it [13, 31, 34]. \nThe proposed system uses PRE as its second building \nblock. PRE is a cryptographic technique used to allow a nsemi-trusted proxy server to convert ciphertext originally \nunder the sender public key into ciphertext under the \nreceiver public key [8, 24, 27-30, 32, 33]. The semi-trusted \nproxy only possesses a re-encryption key generated by the \nsender to be able to complete the conversion process. The \nre-encryption key is distinct for each receiver. In addition, \nthe semi-trusted proxy is not able to learn anything related \nto the plaintext originally encrypted by the sender. The only \nlegitimate user who can decrypt the converted ciphertext is \nthe receiver using his PRE private key. \nThe proposed system exploits PKI as its third building \nblock. PKI is the foundation to achieve an essential \nchallenge for public key cryptography which is ensuring that \na public key for a given user is authentic, and has not been \ntampered with or replaced by a malicious third party using ndigital certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority \n\(CA realization of a \npublic key cryptography scheme was invented by Rivest, \nShamir and Adleman known as RSA cryptosystem [20]. In \naddition, many proposals for public key cryptography \nschemes have evolved such as ElGamal cryptosystem [22] \nand elliptic curve cryptosystems [23]. \nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that ABE, PRE \nand PKI techniques are in the process of continual \nimprovement. The proposed system possess the generic \nconstruction desirable feature which offers the proposed \nsystem independency of any of ABE, PRE and PKI \ntechniques used to implement it. The technique choice is \ndependent on the domain where the system will be \nimplemented. The generic construction desirable feature \nenables the continuous enhancements for the underlining \ntechniques without affecting the system validity. \nIII. PROPOSED SYSTEM \nA. Main Idea  \nThe proposed system initially encrypts the specified \ndigital object with a symmetric key \(K ncryptographic technique such as data encryption standard \n\(DES  AES 36]. \nThe intention of using symmetric cryptography for this step \nis to achieve data confidentiality, to enhance system \nperformance and to facilitate the encryption of large digital \nobjects, i.e.: scalability nIn addition, the proposed system exploits ABE and PRE \nto support fine-grained data access and to eliminate the need \nfor the continuous existence of data owner to encrypt the \nsymmetric key \(K downloading request. The \nachievement of these two main challenges are done by \nsplitting the symmetric key K K1 K2  K1 K2 key and PRE private key to retrieve the \nsymmetric key \(K is encrypted once that enhances the proposed system \nperformance and achieves the system supportability for nlarge digital objects.  \nFor the sake of applying efficient user revocation \nmechanism and prohibits the collusion between users to \naccess unauthorized digital objects, the proposed system \n17\navails user digital passport. Initially, data owner has to \nspecify a number of users groups according to the domian \nwhere the proposed system will be implemented, i.e.: \nadministrators, finance, technical. For each digital object, \ndata 


owner specifies the users groups numbers that can \naccess this object. In addition, data owner associates the nauthorized users groups numbers with every encrypted \ndigital object stored at the cloud. When a user asks to join \nthe system, the data owner assigns a unique group number \nfor the specified user. Moreover, the data owner generates a \nuser digital passport which contains a unique user number. \nThe unique user number is calculated as the result of the \ndigest of assigned group number XOR with the digest of the \nuser PKI certificate serial number. Upon the user request to \naccess an encrypted digital object, the cloud generates the \ndigest of user PKI certificate serial number and XOR it with \nevery digest of the groups numbers associated with the \ndigital object. If and only if one of the results is equal to the \nuser number in the presented user digital passport, the \nsystem grants access to the requested encrypted digital \nobject for the specified user. Furthermore, the digital \npassport includes two dual dual signatures [11]. The first \ndual signature binds the unique user passport number and \nthe user proxy re-encryption key generated by the data nowner. While the second dual signature binds the user proxy \nre-encryption key and the user PKI public key These two \ndual signatures solve the conspiracy problem and prohibit \nthe collusion between users to access unauthorized digital \nobjects. It should be noted that when a revoked user rejoins \nthe system but with different privileges, the data owner \ngenerates a new proxy re-encryption key and assigns a new \ngroup number for the specified user. This results in a \ndifferent user digital passport that achieves the challenge of napplying an efficient user revocation mechanism. \nThe proposed system consists of four main sub-systems nwhich are add new user, add new digital object, download \ndigital object and revoke user. In the following subsections \nwe discuss these sub-systems in details. \nB. Notation and Assumptions  \nThe notation as well as the assumptions that will be used \nthroughout the rest of this paper will be elaborated. Four \ndifferent roles are considered in the proposed system as \nfollows: \n• \(DO X DU Data User who wants to access the digital object. \n• \(CA ncertificates to the system participants. \n• \(CLD notation which will be used throughout the rest of this \npaper is presented at “Table II”. The system assumes that \neach participated party has a PKI public/private keys with \nthe corresponding valid digital certificate In addition, the \nsystem has the desirable feature of generic construction \nwhich allows the usage of any ABE PRE or PKI techniques  \nTABLE II.

In addition, the proposed system \nsteps were implemented using \(Ms DotNet C developed using \(C capabilities of the proposed system to achieve the \nmain challenges, which are mentioned in the previous nsection, are examined separately as follows: \n1 realized by satisfying the following items: \n20\n• Digital objects are encrypted using a symmetric \nkey, i.e step \(2 private key and user PRE key, is secured \nusing PKI as illustrated at step \(4 step \(11 exploits users groups and ABE to \nassign different levels of data access for the specified \nusers. It should be noted that the user can only retrieve \nthe symmetric key to decrypt the digital object if and \nonly if he possesses the appropriate ABE private key, \ni.e.: steps \(8-10 Applying efficient user revocation mechanism: The \nsystem presents a simple and efficient user revocation nprocess. In addition, the revocation process does not \nrequire the intervention of the remaining authenticated \nusers and does not need re-encryption of the uploaded \ndigital objects or generation and re-distribution of new \nkeys. Moreover, the system defends the scenario that an \nattacker claims to be the data owner and requests to \nrevoke an authorized user by using data owner \nsignature, i.e.: step \(1 user sub-system. \nFurthermore, the proposed system does not enforce any \nconstrains on the cloud to store information related to \nuser revocation process or the revoked users. \n4 counters the attack \nwhere an authorized user with insufficient access \nattributes colludes with a revoked user possessing the \nrequired attributes to gain access to unauthorized digital \nobject. This attack has been countered using the \nverification of user digital passport, i.e. steps \(2-5 sub-system.  In addition, the \nproposed system defends the attack of the rejoining of a \nrevoked user authorized with different attributes to gain \naccess to his previously authorized data. Since the \nrejoined user is assigned a new proxy re-encryption key \nand a new group number which results in a new digital npassport and consequently the system denies the user \naccess request with his old digital passport. \n5 Achieving scalability: The proposed system realizes \nthis challenge through capitalizing the usage of offline noperations, i.e. steps \(1, 2, 4, 8-11, 14 1-5 sub-\nsystem, steps \(8-10 nobjects is independent of the number of data users and \nthe number of attributes since the encryption is done nusing symmetric encryption technique, i.e.: step \(2 user \ndigital passport verification procedures, i.e.: steps \(2-5 which are the \nmost heavy workload online operations are performed \nat the cloud service provider side which has large \nprocessing resources without extra storage \nrequirements. \n6 desirable feature: The \nproposed system is independent of PKI, ABE or PRE \ntechniques used. The generic construction of the system \ngives the opportunity for future enhancements of these \ntechniques without affecting the system validity. \nIn addition, the proposed system exploits PKI to defend man \nin the middle attack based on PKI. Moreover, the usage of \ndigital passport minimizes the number of transactions \nneeded to authenticate the specified user. Furthermore, the \ndigital passport simplifies the data management for users nsince the user has to keep his passport only to use it to \naccess the cloud. \nV. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS \nThe proposed system has the generic construction \ndesired feature. Therefore, the experimental measures and nperformance results are highly based on the choice of the \ncombination of PKI, ABE and PRE techniques used for \ndeploying the proposed system. For that reason, a fair \nfoundation of performance results comparison between the \nproposed system and other techniques is not obtainable.  \n“Table III” presents a complexity analysis of the \nproposed system online operations which affects the system \nperformance. The complexity of the mentioned operations \ndepends on the technique chosen for implementation. For \nthat reason, “Table III elaborates the complexity analysis in \nthe form of the operations performed by data owner, user \nand cloud service provider through the different sub-\nsystems. In addition, “Table III” does not take into nconsideration all the offline operations since they do not \naffect the system performance, i.e.: steps \(1, 2 


4, 8-11, 14 1-5 8-10 of download digital \nobject sub-system. For example, the first row of “Table III” \nshows the complexity of the online operations performed \nduring ‘Add new user sub-system’ which is the proxy re-\nencryption keys generation carried by data user, i.e.: step \(6 demonstrates the proposed \nsystem computationally practicability with realizing all the \nmain challenges which hinder the growth of using storage-\nas-a-service for sharing digital objects offered by honest but \ncurious cloud environments. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, a generic, scalable and fine-grained data \naccess system that realizes the main challenges which \nhinder the growth of using storage-as-a-service for sharing \ndigital objects offered by honest but curious cloud \nenvironments has been presented. These challenges are data nconfidentiality, scalability, fine-grained data access, \nefficient user revocation mechanism, collusion resistance \nand generic construction. In addition, the proposed system \nutilizes the user digital passport The digital passport  \n21\nTABLE III. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS \n \nprevents colluding users to access unauthorized data. \nMoreover, the digital passport counters the attack of rejoin \nof a revoked user authorized with different attributes to gain \naccess to his previously authorized data. Furthermore, the \ndigital passport minimizes the number of transactions \nneeded to authenticate the specified user. Additionally, the \ndigital passport facilitates the data management for users \nsince the user has to keep his passport only to access the ncloud. Also, the proposed system prohibits the collusion \nbetween an authorized user and a revoked user to possess \nthe access privileges once assigned to the revoked user. The \nproposed system exploits the existence of PKI to capitalize \nthe usage of offline operations to enhance the system \nperformance, to secure transmission of private data and to \ndefend man in the middle attack. The implementation and \nthe complexity analysis of the proposed system express the \nsystem practicability. The proposed system allows the user \nto be assigned to only one users group. This constrain shall \nbe enhanced to allow user assignment to more than one nusers group in future work. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Final Version of NIST Cloud Computing Definition Published n"http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/cloud-102511.cfm", October,2012. \n[2] S.

stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
