Based \non DEA model this paper measured the financial support \nincluding the overall Marine economy, Marine tertiary \nindustry and Marine of three big areas in our country. Studies \nhave found that the majority of Marine economy enterprises’ \nfinancial support of our country is still in a non-effective state. \nLooking from the point of Marine tertiary industry, the \nfinancial support differences tend to decrease year by year. \nLooking from three areas, the pearl river delta and Yangtze \nriver delta respectively with strong economic strength and \nrich folk finance, resulting in relatively high and rapid growth \nof financial support. This paper argues that the government \nshould continue to offer Marine economy strong financial \nsupport. Meanwhile, the government should develop the multi-\nlevel financial market nKeywords-Marine economy; financial support; DEA; cross-\nsection data \nI. INTRODUCTION \nIn the 21-th century ocean is greatly valued by the world \nas land resource become scarce, population explodes, and \nenvironment deteriorates. And financial capital which is the \ndominant force in the development of maritime industry and nits structural up gradation, has been playing an important role \nin promoting maritime economy in many countries for years \nthat is confirmed by both theories and practice. Financial \nsupport is the basis of maritime economy’s prosperity so that \nits efficiency will determine how prosperous it is. Nationally nassessing objectively the efficiency of financial support of \nChina’s maritime economy enterprises contributes to a \nnation’s macro understanding of financial support for the \noverall maritime economy, serving as national regulatory \nresources to provide theoretical and practical evidence for \nrational financial support, and also offer necessary reference \nfor relevant department to make maritime-economy-oriented npolicies. While from the enterprise perspective, the shortage \nof funds is the current primary factor that hinders the growth \nof China’s maritime economy enterprises and the efficiency \nis a significant one of many factors that affect the financial \nsupport for maritime economy enterprises. Therefore, in \nscientific and rational ways, empirical test and evaluation of \nthe efficiency of financial support for maritime economy nenterprises could relief the plight of financial support for \nChina’s maritime economy enterprises and provide \ntheoretical and practical evidence for improving its \nefficiency as well. Thus, whether from macro and \nmicroscopic aspects, or for policies making and business \noperations, it has practical significance to understand \nfinancial support and its efficiency of maritime economy \nwhich has been universally concerned by policy makers and \nscholars.\nA. Foreign Research \nFor foreign research literature, the majority of them \nfocus on the elaboration and evaluation of financial \nsupporting-system and capital on marine-related industry nincluding marine fisheries, transportation, environmental-\nprotection, energy and other emerging industries On \nfinancial supporting-system for marine-related industries, \nWinskel\(2007 found that in \nmaritime energy innovation social capital and financial \ncapital are coexisting and interactive relationship instead of \nopposites. But for different countries and industries, the \neffect of financial support is not the same. Gravestock\(2001 nsources for marine protected areas come from government \nsupport, while in developing country, it contributes to \nforeign aid and entry fee for protected areas. So, different \nchannels different industries. Spergel and Moye \(2004 maritime protection, \nincluding more than 30 channels. When elaborating and \nevaluating the financial-capital formation mechanisms of \nmaritime economy, Gallegos, Vaahtera and Wolfs \(2005 for selecting the way of financial \nsupport. Actually, diversified methods of financial support \nare critical for marine protected areas. But the combination \nof diversified financial support is required, such as ngovernment support is not controllable. Pointed by Byrne, \nSipsas and Thompson \(1996 port \nconstruction through various forms, but the strength of \ngovernment-funded efforts will vary by country and region. \nSometimes, as long as the government plays as policy-\noriented role in the market economy, its capital is \nunnecessary. Dekker \(2005 Information Management, Innovation Management and Industrial Engineering\n978-1-4799-0245-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE\n459\nsubsidy is unnecessary when port could be expanded \nthrough self-financing. Private financing is a good choice as \nscholars represented by Trujillo and Nombela\(2000 investment had a \npositive impact on port efficiency. \nB. Domestic Research \nFor China, since the State Council formulated the \n“National Marine Economic Development Plan” in 2003, \nthe State and local government have issued a series of \npolicies to stimulate the development of marine economy to \npromote financial capital 


entering marine economy. \nHowever, due to profit-driven nature of financial capital and \ninvalid government policy implementation, marine economy \nwas not taken seriously. \nMost scholars believe that financial support for marine \neconomy has bottlenecking problem, namely financial \nrepression\(Jinyu Lin, Xiaoyan Ren, 2011 Zhengkang \nTang,2011; Xin Zhao, Xiaoqing Jing,2012 high investment, long \nrecovery period, high professional standard, mainly affect \nits financial support. Some academics put forward financial \nsupport measures for China blue economic development by \nlearning developed countries’ experience. At the same time, \nsome scholars analyze the characteristics of regional marine neconomy by localization and suggest to make financial \nsupporting strategies suitable for regional marine economy \nfrom blue credit, direct financing, mixed financing \ninnovation, guidance for private financing and investment \nand etc..\(Xiang Ma, Wuqin Sun, 2012; Baoyun Wang, Yi \nFeng, 2010 industries of marine \neconomy, some scholars propose that developing these \nindustries should be in an appropriate way by considering \naspects like financial system innovation, financial market \ninnovation and financial services innovation. \(Jian Sun, \nMan Lin, 2001; Junhong Wang, Shanli Lv, 2010 studies emphasize that government should build a \nsound system of government support in order to provide npolicy guidance and construct multi-level, wide coverage \nfinancing-channels for financial support of marine economy. \nSimultaneously, it is necessary to speed up the pace of \ninnovation in financial services, form services and needs \nadapting to diverse development of marine economy and \noptimize maritime ecological environment to meet different \nphases and different areas of marine economy, so are \nneeded policies and regulatory support. \nDEA model was proposed by A.Charnes, \nW.W.Cooper&E.Rhodes\(1978 time. \nIt is widely used in the studies of economic management to \nanalyze problems in the efficiency of financing in capital \nmarket, efficiency of regional financial development and \nefficiency of financial support. For example, Lichang \nLiu\(2004 listed companies with DEA model. Fei \nLiu\(2007 analyzing it in China’s major regions with \nDEA model. Zhengde Xiong\(2011 macroeconomic situation on the development of \nindustries and effect of the efficiency of financial support nrenders stage property on the basis of the efficiency of \nfinancial support for strategic emerging industries. \nFrom above, most researches focus on local case, explore \nthe importance of financial support for the development of \nmarine economy from concrete industries, and get some \ninteresting conclusions about ways of financial support, \nwhich are very helpful for the study of marine economy. \nHowever, there are some limitations: First, most studies \nabout maritime financial support base on historical facts, \nwhich are still introduction of practice and history of marine \nfinancial development, and lack relevant empirical research nSecond, these studies are concentrated in their respective \nregions or industries, without systematic analysis; Third, \nthey only stress the role of funds implantation for maritime \ndevelopment lacking empirical judge for the efficiency of \nfinancial support. So, we start to use DEA model to study the \nefficiency of financial support for marine economy, compare \nand analyze its differences in three industries and three major nregions of marine economy in different policies and \neconomic background, and finally provide policy advice for \nthe plan and development of China marine economy basing \non empirical results. \nII. MODEL \nData envelopment analysis\(DEA ndeveloped which is put forward by the famous American \noperations research experts A.Charnes and W.W.Copper et \nal in 1978.Data envelopment analysis is using mathematical \nprogramming methods of non-parametric to estimate with \nmulti-input, multi-output characteristics of the economic \nsystem among the technical effectiveness, and other aspects \nof returns to scale relative effectiveness of decision making \nunits. In the literature, Ali and Seiford have demonstrated \nlinear transformation invariance of the DEA model does not nchange the function of the efficient frontiers; Pastor \ndemonstrated the output-oriented BCC model allows ntransforming the inputs data, and input-oriented BCC model \nallows transforming on output data, that does not affect the \nefficiency value. Accordingly, based on negative output \nindicators in the output indexes, we use the input-oriented \nBCC model to evaluate the efficiency of financial support. \nIII. VARIABLES AND DATA DESCRIPTION \nA. Selection of Indicators \nThis article will define the financial support efficiency of \nmarine economy as the industrial enterprises obtain funds \nfrom financial markets and put these resources into nproduction and operation, thus promoting enterprises to \nachieve maximum performance of output and the scale nefficiency. When selected DEA input and output indicators, \nthis paper apply two kinds of indicators selection principle \nincluding the production method and the asset approach, \ndrawing on the basis of the selection criteria of existing \n460\nresearch indicators to select the amount of financing, debt \namount as input indicators, reflecting the direct and indirect \nfinancing financial support for the case. Meanwhile 


this \npaper will select four measurement enterprise growth ability \nindicators as output index, including operating revenue, total \nprofit, and net profit attributable to shareholders of listed \ncompanies and operating cash flows. Also they can reflect \nthe behavior of financial support to the influence of the nenterprise performance and the size. \nB. Data Sources \nConsidering the proportion of output value of three major \nindustries of marine economy and the regions of the \ncompany, this paper randomly selected 82 companies from \nmarine economy related listed companies, including   10 \ncompanies from the first industry, 33 companies from the \nsecondary industry and 39 companies from the tertiary \nindustry. Geographically, 82 sample data including the Bohai \nRim region 29, the Yangtze River Delta region 30, the Pearl \nRiver Delta region 23 Considering the marine economy \nbegan to really develop from 2005, therefore we select 2005 \nas the base period of marine economy development. 2006 is \nthe first year of the national implement the “Eleventh Five-\nYear Plan” and 2010 is the last year, the national and local \nare gradually introduced policies to stimulate the \ndevelopment of marine economy, so the two years can look \nas a representative time points of marine economic \ndevelopment. In 2008 the State Council approved the \n“National Marine Development Plan while suffered \nfinancial crises in 2008, the economic situation is therefore \nthe most difficult of the year In 2012 the State Council \napproved the “National marine function zoning”, and \nproposed main function and development direction of the \nkey sea areas, so 2012 can be used as a Marine economy \nindustry development the representation of the time \ndifference. In conclusion, in the sample representativeness \nand comparative due consideration, we choose 2005, 2006, \n2008, 2010 and 2012, this five years as the sample period is \nanalyzed This data are from the listed companies’ financial \nstatements. \nIV. EMPIRICAL TEST AND ANALYSIS \nThrough software processing, we obtain China’s marine \neconomy financial support of the comprehensive technical nefficiency \(TE PTE SE is divided \ninto the following two parts: First, the analysis of marine \neconomy overall efficiency of the financial support; Second, \nthe analysis of marine economy three industries and the three \nmajor regional financial support efficiency. \nA. The analysis of marine economy overall efficiency of \nthe financial support n82 sample enterprises financial support efficiency \nrelative values shown in Table 1, which reflects the marine \neconomy overall efficiency of the financial support. As can \nbe seen from Table 1, in year 2005, the number of 82 \nmarine economy enterprises respectively has achieved \ncomprehensive technical efficiency, pure technical \nefficiency and scale at a relatively effective were 19, 22 and \n19 ,accounting for 23.17% of the total enterprises, 26.83% \nand 23.17%, indicating that these marine economy \nenterprises in the corresponding reference set of financial \nsupport for efficiency in a relatively active state, that input \nto a minimum, and the output is maximized;  Remaining  \nenterprises relative efficiency values are less than 1,and thus \nthe efficiency of the financial support in a non-effective \nstate, indicating that the input or output of these enterprises \nshould be improved. From Table 1, we also found that in \n2006 comprehensive technical efficiency pure technical \nefficiency and scale at a relatively effective companies that \nare redundant in 2005, shows that in 2006 China’s financial \nsupport efficiency of marine economy improvement than in \n2005.But from 2008 the financial support for the cause of \nthe relatively low efficiency may be affected by the \nfinancial crisis in 2008, and the marine economy difficulties \nto get financial support from the financial market; \nCombined with the Marine economy high risk and long \nrecovery period characteristics lead industry as a whole nrelatively low level of financial support efficiency. \nLooking from 2010 and 2012 situation, comprehensive ntechnical efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale at \nrelatively effective companies is significantly higher than in \n2005, 2006 and 2008, the number in 2010 is respectively 23, \n30 and 23, also in 2012 is respectively 23, 25 and 23, \nindicating our country marine economy enterprise financial \nsupport as a whole has a tendency to improve efficiency, but \nthis trend will be influenced by some emergencies such as \nthe financial crisis, leading to temporary stagnation and \neven backwards. \nFrom Table 1, it is easy to see, from 2005 to 2012, our \ncountry marine economy enterprises both from the \ncomprehensive technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency \nand scale efficiency, there are about more than 70% of the \nenterprise is in the non-effective state, reflects our country \nmarine economy enterprises from the non-effective state to \nthe effective transition potential is tremendous, financial \nsupport efficiency remains to be further improved nTABLE I.

The marine economy three industries and three major \nregional financial support efficiency analyses.\nIn order to dig the reason how our country marine \neconomy financial support efficiency to form. In this paper, \nthe sample companies from 2005 to 2012 are made \ncomparative analysis from the three industries and three \nregions of marine economy, the results are shown in the \nfollowing table. Table 2 is Marine economy three industries \nfinancial support comprehensive technical efficiency average \ntable from 2005 to 2012. From the DEA measure results, we \nknow Measurement results from the DEA, the average of \nmarine economy comprehensive technical efficiency is low \nin 2005, 2006 and 2008, and presents the tendency of \ndecrease year by year. This three-year average, respectively \nare 0.609741, 0.604413 and 0.593489. It can be seen since \nthe Eleventh Five-Year” development planning was \nintroduced in 2005, China’s marine economy financial \nsupport efficiency is still at a low level, one of the main \nreasons is that although the state has adopted documents to \nsupport marine economy, but the measures are not real \nimplementation. \nStarting in 2010 the marine economy DEA \ncomprehensive technical efficiency averages are growth and \nthe efficiency value is 0.733376. And financial support to \nachieve a higher efficiency values in 2012 as 0.875811. It \ncan be seen after 2008, with the macro-economic rebound, \nand the State Council approved the three national marine \neconomic zone developments planning in 2011, the policy \nsupport measures to get real implementation. From the \ncomparative analysis of three industries, three years average \ncomprehensive technical efficiency change degree is put in nbigger difference in 2005, 2006 and 2008.In details, the \ntertiary industry was higher in 2005, at 0.657869 the second \nindustry was higher in 2006, at 0.617739 and the second \nindustry is higher in 2008, at 0.617739.And the three \nindustries financial support efficiency exist a greater degree \nof differences between industries in 2005 and 2006, the \ndifference is 0.096808 and 0.091808, while the difference \nbetween the three industries become a lesser extent in 2008, \nthe difference is 0.060378. From 2010 and 2012, three \nindustries comprehensive technical efficiency mean has \ngradually increased, and at a high level. And the degree of ndifference between the three industries is gradually reduced, \nthe difference were 0.08336, 0.05763 Financial support \nefficiency can be seen that the efficiency differences of \nindustrial exist, but in the event of financial crisis, the \ndifference tends to decrease. It also can be seen that the three \nindustries support by marine policy, thus the financial \nsupport efficiency difference is reduced and tend to occur nindustrial development reversal.  These result consistent with \nthe economic goals of nations proposed that to accelerate the \ndevelopment of marine economy, makes the three industrial \nstructure presents the proportion of primary industry decline, \nthe proportion of Secondary industry rising, at the same time ngrowing the tertiary industry, and promote the marine \nindustry structure from the “secondary industry tertiary \nIndustry, primary industry” type to “tertiary Industry,  \nsecondary industry, primary industry” type accelerating \ntransformation, finally, to achieve quality improvement of \nblue economy. \nThe five years sample period from 2005 to 2012 show \nthat the tertiary industry comprehensive technical efficiency \nmean are the lowest in 2006, 2008 and 2010, respectively, \nthe mean are 0.585234, 0.557361 and 0.711936, but with the nhighest average industry difference is reducing year by year, \nuntil 2012 was reversed, and the difference with maximum \nnarrowed to 0.057629. Seeing from the point of growth, the \nfinancial support efficiency of the tertiary industry occur the \nlargest increase from 2005 to 2012, which increased from \n0.557361 to 0.885529 an increase of 58.88 percent, followed \nby secondary industry, an increase of 52.62 percent, the \nlowest increase in the primary sector, at 48.48%. It can be \nseen that for the rapid growth of the tertiary industry the \nmain reason is that benefit from marine-oriented economic \npolicy. In cultivating growing ocean emerging industries, \nsuch as the modern marine service industry of the tertiary \nindustry is a new bright spot of economic growth oceans, \nalso to promote marine industrial structure and achieve \nmainly from secondary industry to the tertiary industry \ntransformation. Therefore it has received a great policy \nsupport. \nTABLE II. 2005-2012  FINANCIAL  SUPPORT  COMPREHENSIVE \nTECHNICAL  EFFICIENCY  AVERAGE TABLE  OF  MARINE  ECONOMY THREE \nINDUSTRIES\nYear 2005 2006 2008 2010 2012 \nMean 0.60974\n1\n0.6044\n13 0.593489 \n0.7333\n76 \n0.8758\n11 nInd\nustr\nies\nPrimary 0.63610\n6\n0.6770\n42 0.615545 \n0.7952\n96 \n0.9139\n40 \nSeconda\nry \n0.56106\n1\n0.6069\n29 0.617739 \n0.7573\n27 \n0.8563\n10 \nTertiary 0.65786\n9\n0.5852\n34 0.557361 \n0.7119\n36 \n0.8855\n29 \nNote: Data from Financial Reports of Listed Companies \nTable 3 shows the three major regional financial support \ncomprehensive technical efficiency mean of marine \neconomy. From the DEA measure results, we can see that \nthe Yangtze River Delta regional financial support efficiency \nhas the largest increase from 2005 to 2012, which increased n462\nfrom 0.55113 to 0.86799, increased 57.49%, followed by the \nPearl River Delta region, an increase of 51.61 percent, the \nlowest is Bohai Sea region, an increase of 42.89%. But in the \nsample period of 5 years 


the Pearl River Delta regional \ncomprehensive technical efficiency mean dominant years \nmore for the 2006 2010 and 2012. The main reason is \nbecause as Guangdong Province of the Pearl River Delta \nregion, is the pioneer of reform and opening up, also the \nGDP output ranked first in the country every year, so rely on nstrong economic strength, it possess a comparative \nadvantage in the national strategic industry is very normal. \nFor the rapid growth of the Yangtze River Delta, it might \nbenefit from the strong policy support of Shanghai and \nZhejiang province, as well as due to the folk financing \nmarket is relatively developed and leading to the \ndiversification of financing channels for enterprises. As can \nbe seen in the three marine regional planning, the financial \nsupport efficiency for the Pearl River Delta is relatively high. \nTherefore the three regions have their own respective \nsuperiority. Also, it is worth learning from each other. \nTABLE III. 2005-2012FINANCIAL SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE \nTECHNICAL EFFICIENCY AVERAGE TABLE OF MARINE ECONOMY THREE nMAJOR REGION \nYear 2005 2006 2008 2010 2012 \nMean 0.60974 0.60441 0.59349 0.73338 0.87581\nRegion\nBohai 0.59939 0.62557 0.56458 0.77660 0.85647\nYRD 0.62474 0.55113 0.59389 0.71094 0.86799\nPRD 0.60035 0.66651 0.65977 0.74521 0.91020\nNote: Data from Financial Reports of Listed Companies\nV. CONCLUTIONS \nThrough the contrast analysis of Marine economy \nsupport for a five-specific period from 2005 to 2008.Based \non data envelopment analysis method, studies have found as \nfollows:  \nFirst, in the whole, the financial support of part of Marine \neconomy enterprises have reached high level, which account \nfor 25.12 percent. While the vast majority of Marine \neconomy enterprises’ financial support of our country is still \nin a non-effective state This phenomenon reflects the fact \nthat there is tremendous potential for Marine economy \nenterprises of our country to shift from a non-effective state \nto a valid state. \nSecond, looking from Marine tertiary industry the \nfinancial support differences, but difference tends to decrease \nyear by year. Furthermore, difference tends decrease because \nof the disadvantage of financing environment. When \nconfronted with the financial crisis, the decrease of industry \ndifference after the policy support in 2010, especially there \nhas rapid growth in the tertiary industries which lead to the \nreversal. One of the main reasons is the orientation of Marine \neconomy policy. Among the emerging Marine economy \nindustries, such as the modern Marine service of the tertiary \nindustry is a new luminescent spot of Marine economic \ngrowth, therefore received a great policy support. That is \nconsistent with the policy emphasizing on accelerating the \ndevelopment of Marine economy shifting from the “two, \nthree, one” type to “three, two, one” type and increase the \nblue economic quality nThird, from the point of three main areas of Marine \neconomy, the Pearl river delta financial support are nrelatively high. Some areas of the Pearl River delta such as \nGuangdong province are the pioneer of reform and opening \nup. Whose annual GDP ranked with first in China. As a \nresult, with strong economic strength and national policy \nsupport, it possesses a comparative advantage in the national \nstrategic industry. With the rapid growth of the Yangtze \nriver delta, it might benefit from shanghai and government’s \nstrong support of Marine economy in Zhejiang province, as \nwell as the folk financing market is relatively \ndeveloped ,leading to the diversification of financing \nchannel, in conclusion three regions have advantage which \nis worth to learn from each other. \nPolicy significance of this paper is as follows:  \nFirst, from the macro perspective China’s Marine \neconomy development keep up growing, meanwhile, this is \ndriven by related industrial policy support of sea power \nstrange and market economy. But the rapid development of \nMarine economy still needs more capital investment to \nexpand the scale of production to achieve economies of \nscale. So the government should continue to offer strong \nMarine economy financial support policy guidance. Making \nand carrying out the policy of the Marine economy industry \nsupport is very important to promote the development of \nMarine economy. If quite a proportion of enterprises’ \nfinancial support is not in a valid state, it is bound to affect \nthe further financial support. Therefore country should be \nfocused on characteristics of Marine economy enterprise \nindustry to optimize financial support policies and establish \nmultilevel financial market. Then according to \ncharacteristics of sea area, creating a favorable external \nfinancing environment for our country. For example, local \ngovernments can strongly support Marine economy by its \neconomic strength. And it also can use the folk capital to \ndevelop Marine economy. \nSecond, from the micro perspective, policies can \neffectively track and supervise large and medium-sized \nenterprises of financial support to promote enterprises to \nachieve a valid state. Marine economy enterprise itself \nshould continuously improve the level of enterprise \nproduction technology and capital operation ability to \nimprove the management level and encourage managers to \nrealize the comprehensive technical efficiency by stimulating ninnovation and controlling the scale of enterprise, so as to \nmaximize the value of the company nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nFirst and foremost, I would like to show my deepest \ngratitude to my teacher, Dr. Wang Zhaohui, a respectable, \nresponsible and resourceful scholar, who has provided me \nwith valuable guidance in every stage of the writing of this \nthesis.

FINAL REMARKS\nIn this paper we presented an approach for supporting the\nenergy-aware adaptation of business processes at design time\ndriven by an optimization problem that takes into account both\ninfrastructural, applicative, and environmental standpoints. In\nparticular, the adaptation actions available to the application\ndesigner rely on the de?nition of variants for the tasks com-\nposing the business process.\nThis approach is now heavily based on the assumption that\nmonitored data about previous executions are available, and\ninformation able to give the values for the interesting metrics\nare all included in this knowledge base. For future development\nof our approach, we aim to relax this assumption, trying to\nunderstand if we can infer the values of the metrics in case\nthe data needed to compute them analytically are not present.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work has been supported by the ECO2Clouds project\n\(http://eco2clouds.eu activity of the 7th Framework\nProgramme under contract number 318048.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Greenpeace, “How Clean Is Your Cloud?,” tech. rep., 04 2012.\n[2] A.

PARTITIONING SCHEME \nIn this section, we describe some additional details of the \npartitioning schemes. For a given n nodes and P processors, \nwe create P partitions Vo, V1 , . . .  Vp-1 . The processors are \nlabeled as 0, 1 ,  . . .  P - 1. Partition Vi is processed by pro­\ncessor i. For each scheme, we need to know i of nodes in each partition, and iii Below we show how to calculate them for the three \npartitioning schemes. \nA.1 Uniform Consecutive Partitioning UCP assigned to the par­\ntitions. \nPartition size: The sizes of the partitions are almost equal. \nLet B = I f5 l Then, the size of a partition is either B or \nB -1. \nPartition range: Partition i includes the nodes from iB nto \(i  + I III J . \nA.2 Linear Consecutive Partitioning \(LCP par­\ntitions, and the number of nodes in the partitions are mod­\neled by arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d a+\(P- l are partition pal'ame­\nters. At the end of this section, we discuss how a and d are \ndetermined. \nPartition range: Partition i has the nodes from L;:? \(a+ \njd 2a+\(?-1 a + jd i + 1 2a?id 1 .  \nFinding processor rank: Given a node u ,  we need to \nfind the partition i such that u E Vi, Node u satisfies the \nfollowing inequality: \ni-I \nl 2a + \(i - l i + 1 2a id 11 pa­\nrameters a and d are determined using the number of nodes \nn and the number of processors P. Parameter d 


is the slope \nof the straight line y = a + dx, where y represent the num­\nber of nodes in the processor with rank x = i. We calcu­\nlate d by finding two points on this straight line. Putting \ni = 0 and i = P -1 in Eqn 10, we can compute nl and \nnp- l .  Then, the number of nodes in the first processor is \nnl - no = nl and the number of nodes in last processor is \nnp - np- l = n - 1 - np- l .  Hence, we have \nNow, we have \nd = \nn - 1 np- l - nl \nP \n. \nP- l \n2 2a + \(P - l P - l Round Robin Partitioning \n\(12 partitions, the number of nodes is almost \nequal for all partitions. Similar to UCP scheme, the size of \na partition is either I f5 l  or I f5 l  - 1. \nPartition range: For round robin partitioning, partition i \nhas the nodes i, i + P, i + 2P, . . .  i + \(B - l parti­\ntion i is determined by i = u mod P. \nComputation load: The expected number of request mes­\nsages received for node k is \(Hn- 1  - Hk see Lemma 3.4 load \nfor node k is CL\(k Hn- 1  - Hk with partition Vi = {j Ij \nmod P = i} is PL\(i Hn- 1  - Hk + b CL\(k1 k2 i l i2 between the loads of two processors is \nPL\(O P -1 Hn- 1  - Hk + b Hn- 1  - Hk + b kEVp_ l  \nS \(Hn- 1  + b 1 V0 1 - l Vp- 1 1 l i = 0, \nkEVrl kEVp_ l  \nL Hk < L Hk + Hn , \nk EVp_ l  kEVrl \nand thus, PL\(O P -1 log n nOtherwise, \n1 V0 1 - l Vp- 1 1 = 1, \nL Hk S L Hk ,  \nk EVp_ l  k EVo \nand thus, PL\(O P -1 O\(log n

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration.

The measurement range is important to defme \nthe 5th or 6th degree polynomial used to convert the 8-bit \ndigital words in telemetry back to analog telemetry so the \ntelemetry processing and display system can accurately \ndisplay the biological and engineering diagnostic \ninformation to ground personnel for analysis. \n1 7  \nTable 3 .

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
