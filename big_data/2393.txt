Using Sequential and Non-Sequential Patterns in Predictive Web Usage Mining Tasks Bamshad Mobasher, Honghua Dai Tao Luo Miki Nakagawa mobasher,hdai,tluo,miki}@cs.depaul.edu School of Computer Science, Telecommunication and Information Systems DePaul University Chicago, Illinois USA Abstract We describe an efficient framework for Web personaliza tion based on sequential and non-sequentialpattern discov ery fmrn usage data Our experimental results performed on real usage datu indicate that more restrictive panerns such 
as contiguous sequential patterns e.g frequent navi gational paths are more suitable for predictive tusks, such as Web prefetching, which involve predicting which item is accessed next by a user while less constrained patterns such as frequent itemsers or general sequential patterns are more effective alternarives in the context of Web personal izarion and recommender systems 1 Introduction Web usage mining techniques 9 that rely on offline pattern discovery from user transactions can be used to solve 
scalability problems associated with personalization systems based on standard collaborative filtering In addi tion user models discovered through data mining can cap ture more fine-grained information. such as the inherent or dering among accessed pages, than standard techniques af ford However using more fine-grained information about users navigational histories as part of pattern discovery does not necessarily translate to more effective personaliza tion Furthermore, techniques that may prove effective for predictive tasks such as prefetching may not necessarily be appropriate in the 
context of personalization In this paper we present a scalable framework for Web personalization based on both sequential and non-sequential pattern mining from clickstream data Our framework in cludes efficient data structures for storing frequent itemsets or sequential patterns combined with algorithms which al low for effective real-time generation of recommendations We have conducted a detailed comparative evaluation 0-7695-1754-4/02 17.00 Q 2002 IEEE 669 based on real usage data of both sequential and non sequential patterns in terms 
of their effectiveness and suit ability for personalization tasks We distinguish between two different evaluation methodologies one suited for eval uation of personalization effectiveness and the other de signed for evaluating the performance of predictive tasks such as Web prefetching which involve predicting which item the user will access next during hisher navigation Our empirical results show that more restrictive patterns such as contiguous sequential patterns e.g frequent nav igational paths\are more suitable for predictive tasks such as Web prefetching which involve predicting which item 
the user will access next during hisher navigation On the other hand less constrained patterns, such as frequent item sets or general sequential patterns are more effective alter natives in the context of Web personalization 2 Preprocessing and Pattern Discovery The overall process of Web personalization generally consists of three phases data preparation and transfor mation pattern discovery, and recommendation In tradi tional collaborative filtering approaches, the pattern discov ery phase e.g., neighborhood foimation in the k-nearest 
neighbor as well as the recommendation phase are per formed in real time In contrast personalization systems based on Web usage mining 6,7 perform the pattern dis covery phase offline Data preparation phase transforms raw web log files into clickstream data that can be processed by data mining tasks The recommendation engine consid ers the active user session in conjunction with the discov ered patterns to provide personalized content Web usage preprocessing 151 ultimately result in 
a set of n pageviews P  p~;pl  pn and a set of m user transactions T  t tz    tm where each ti E Tis a subset of P Conceptually we view each transaction t as an I-length sequence of ordered pairs t  P;:4P PL i   dl 44 1 


where each p  pj for some j E l    n and w\(p is the weight associated with pageview p in the transaction t usually binary weights are used in the context of associa tion rule and sequential pattern discovery We focus on three data mining techniques Association Rule mining AR I 21 Sequential Pattern SP 31 and Contiguous Sequential Pattern CSP discovery CSPs are a special form of sequential patterns in which the items ap pearing in the sequence must be adjacent with respect to the underlying ordering In the context of Web usage data CSP\222s can be used to capture frequent navigational paths among user trails IO In contrast items appearing in SP\222s while preserving the underlying ordering, need not he ad jacent and thus they represent more general navigational patterns within the site Frequent item sets discovered as pan of association rule mining represent the least restric tive type of navigational patterns since they focus on the presence of items rather than the order in which they occur within user session 3 Personalization With Sequential and Non Sequential Patterns The recommendation engine takes a collection of frc quent itemsets or contiguous sequential patterns as input and generates a recommendation set by matching the cur rent user\222s activity against the discovered patterns We use a fixed-size sliding window over the current active session to capture the current user\222s history depth Thus, the slid ing window of size n over the active session allows only the last TL visited pages to influence the recommendation value of items in the recommendation set We call this sliding window the user\222s active session window The recommendation engine based on association rules matches the current user session window with frequent itemsets to find candidate pageviews for giving recommen dations Given an active session window w and a group of frequent itemsets we only consider all the frequent itemsets of size lwl  1 containing the current session window The recommendation value of each candidate pageview is based on the confidence of the corresponding association rule whose consequent is the singleton containing the pageview to be recommended In order to facilitate the search for itemsets of size Jwl  1 containing the current session window w the fre quent itemsets are stored in a directed acyclic graph, here called a Frequent ltemset Graph The Frequent Itemset Graph is an extension of the lexicographic tree used in the tree projection algorithm of I The graph is organized into levels from 0 to k where IC is the maximum size among all frequent itemsets Each node at depth d in the graph corresponds to an item set I of size d and is linked to itemsets of size d  1 that contain I at level d  1 The single root node at level 0 corresponds to the empty itemset To be able to match dif ferent orderings of an active session with frequent itemsets all itemsets are sorted in lexicographic order before being inserted into the graph The user\222s active session is also sorted in the same manner before matching with patterns Given an active user session window w sorted in lexico graphic order, a depth-first search of the Frequent Itemset Graph is performed to level JwJ If a match is found then the children of the matching node n containing w are used to generate candidate recommendations Each child node of n corresponds to a frequent itemset w U p In each case, the pageview p is added to the recommendation set if the support ratio u\(w U p w is greater than or equal to a where a is a minimum confidence threshold Note that u\(w U p w is the confidence of the association rule w  p The confidence of this rule is also used as the recommendation score for pageview p It is easy to ob serve that in this algorithm the search process requires only O\(lw1 time given active session window w The recommendation algorithm based on association rules can be adopted to work also with sequential respec tively contiguous sequential patterns In this case we focus on frequent contiguous sequences of size JwJ  1 whose prefix contains an active user session w The can didate pageviews to be recommended are the last items in all such sequences The recommendation values are based on the confidence of the patterns A simple trie structure is used to store both the sequential and contiguous sequential patterns discovered during the pattern discovery phase Depending on the specified support threshold and win dow size it might be difficult to find large enough itemsets or sequential patterns that could be used for providing rec ommendations, leading to reduced coverage. This is panic ularly true for sites with very small average session sizes In order to overcome this problem we use all-kth-order method proposed in SI in the context of Markov chain mod els The order of the Markov model corresponds to the number of prior events used in predicting a future event Our recommendation framework for contiguous sequen tial patterns is essentially equivalent to kth-order Markov models however rather than storing all navigational se quences we only store frequent sequences resulting from the sequential pattern mining process The notion of all kth-order models can also easily he extended to the con text of general sequential patterns and association rule We extend our recommendation algorithms to generate all-kth order recommendations as follows First the recommenda tion engine uses the largest possible active session window as an input for recommendationeugine If the enginecannot generate any recommendations the size of active session window is iteratively decreased until a recommendation is generated or the window size becomes 0 670 


4 Experimental Evaluation We conjecture that more restrictive patterns e.g CSP may he better suited for predictive applications such as Web prefetching which involve predicting a user\222s next immedi ate access to a page This is in contrast to personalization tasks which involve prediction a broader\set of pages to he recommended to the user based on hidher previous ac cess patterns Thus we propose two different evaluation methodologies which here we shall call NEXT and ALL respectively The NEXT method evaluates recommendation effectiveness by comparing the system\222s predictions with a user\222s immediate next action, while the ALL method com pares the predictions against all of the user\222s remaining ac tions \(accesses to pageviews in the duration of a session The experiments were performed on real Web usage data from 3 different commercial and non-commercial sites The results shown helow represent selected experiments from only one of these data set the full set of results and ex periments are included in the full paper and available upon request For all experiments we performed IO-fold cross validation In each iteration, each transaction 1 in the evalu ation set was divided into two parts The first 71 pageviews in t were used for generating recommendations whereas the remaining portion oft target sec was used to evalu ate the generated recommendations Given a window size w 5 n we select a subset or a subsequence in the case of SP or CSP of the first n pageviews as the surrogate for a user\222s active session window denoted by ast Both All and NEXT evaluation methods take ast and a recommendation threshold T as inputs and produce a set of pageviews as recommendations The recommendation set contains all pageviews whose recommendation score is at least T The NEXT method compares the generated rec ommendations with the immediate next pageview in the re maining portion of the transaction t On the other hand the ALL method compares the recommendation set to all of the pageviews in the remaining portion of t The pre cision measure represents the ratio of matches between the recommendation set and the target set to the size of recom mendation set The coverage measure represents the ratio of matches to the size of the target set Finally for a given recommendation threshold T the mean over all transactions in the evaluation set is computed as the overall evaluation score for each of the measures in hoth evaluation methods Figure 1 depicts the results for the all-kth-order versions of the three recommendation methods for hoth data sets. In these comparisons we also included the precision and cov erage of the standard k-Nearest-Neighbor kNN technique for standard collaborative filtering The value of k was cho sen based sensitivity analysis for the best performance in terms of coverage and precision 0.1 02 0.3 Ob OS 0.6 01 0.8 OB  0.5   01 1 0.3 02 0.4 0 0.1 02 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.0 0.7 0.1 0.8 1 Rsomm.nd.tlamn.hgld Figure 1 Recommendation Effectiveness Using Varying Sized User Histories Based on the ALL Method The results show that in this case SP will have similar or better performance than CSP in terms of hoth cover age and precision This phenomenon is likely due to the fact that varying window sizes has a more dramatic impact on the precision of CSP than on SP or AR The AR mod els also performs well in the context of personalization In general the precision of AR model is lower than SP hut it does provide better overall coverage The comparison to kNN shows that all of the techniques presented in this pa per, outperform kNN in terms of precision. In general kNN provides good coverage usually in par with the AR model hut the difference in coverage is diminished if we insist on higher recommendation thresholds and thus more accurate recommendations We also compared the precision and coverage of AR SP and CSP based on the NEXT evaluation method To pro vide a better basis for comparison of these results to those based on the ALL method we use the same support thresh old and window size parameters as those used in Figure 1 The results are shown in Figure 2 The results show that in this context the CSP model provides much higher precision levels that hoth SP and AR 671

Proposition 6.1 Y is a derived attribute of B iff Y is exten sion functionally depended EFD on B By definition the occurrence of an extension function ally dependency EFD means there is an attribute trans formation f  Dom\(B x  Dom\(Bk  Dom\(Y such that f\(B\(v  Y\(v V v E V By definition Y  f\(B B    Bk this completes our arguments Table 4 illustrates the notion of EFD and attribute transfor mations Table 4 An Attribute Transformation in K 6.2 Feature Extractions and Constructions Feature extractions and constructions in intensional view are much harder to describe formally since features repre sent human view and their mathematical relations have to be set up for all possible instances consistently We will take extensional view the view from data's prospect Let us examine some assertions in traditional view\from 25 All new constructed features are defined in terms of original features  and Feature extraction is a process that extracts a set of new features from the orig inal features through some functional mapping." By taking the data view it is easy to see both assertions imply that the new constructed feature is a function functional mapping of old features Note that Let A  A   A be the attributes before the ex tractions or constructions and A   A be the new attributes From the analysis above the new attributes fea tures are functions of old ones we have f  Dom\(A x   x Dmn\(A i Do~\(A From the analysis on Section 6.1 4"+k is a derived at tribute of A We summarize the analysis in Proposition 6.2 The features constructed from classical feature extractions and constructions are derived attributes in extension view 6.3 Derived Attributes in the Canonical Model From Proposition 5.2.1 K is isomorphic to the canoni cal model CK So there is a corresponding Table 4 in the canonical model In other words there is a map V/Bk x  x V/Bk  V/\(Bi n  n Bk i V/YE This map between quotient sets implies a refinements in the partitions thatis,Y~isacoarseningofBE  B'n  nBk So we have the following Proposition 6.3 Y is a derived attribute of B iff YE is a coarsening of BE  B n    B where Y E A and BCA 7 Granular Data Model of Relation Lattice In this section we modify Lee's work At the beginning of Section 3.2 we have recalled the observation of [29 71 that any subset of A induces a partition on V the pan tion induced by A is denoted by QJ The power set ZA is Boolean algebra and hence a lattice where meet and join operations are the union and intersection of the A respec tively Let A\(V be the set of all partitions on V equiv alence relations A\(V forms a lattice where meet is the intersection of equivalence relations and join is the union where the union denoted by UjQ is the smallest coars ening of all Qj,j  1,2   A\(V is called the partition lattice Recall the convention all attributes are non-isomorphic attributes Hence all equivalence relations are distinct see Section 3.1 Next proposition is due to Lee Proposition 7.1 There is a map 8  2A  A\(V that respects the meet but not the join operations Lee called the image Im8 the relation lattice and observe that 1 The join in Imb is different from that of A\(V 2 So Imb is a subset hut not a snhlattice of A\(V Such an embedding is an unnatural one but Lee focused his efforts on it he established many connections between database concepts and lattice theory However we will in stead take a natural embedding Definition 1.2 The smallest lattice generated by Imb by abuse of language is called the \(Lin's relation lattice de noted by L\(Q This definition will not cause confusing. since we will not use Lee's notion at all The difference between L\(Q and ImO is that former contains all the join of distinct attributes The pair V L\(Q is the granular data model of the Lin's relation lattice It should be clear 286

10 Conclusions In this paper, we successfully enumerate all possible de rived attributes of a given relation The results seem strik ing however, they are of theoretical nature Even though L   contains a complete list of all attributes, the number is insurmountably large; it is bounded by the Bell number Bn where n is the cardinality of the smallest paniton in L\222\(Q The exhaustive search of association rules on all those attributes are beyond the current reach However by combining the classical techniques of feature selections we may reach new applications. Classical feature selection has focused on the original set of attributes, now with our new result, it seems suggest that the domain of feature selection should he extended to this complete universal set of derived attributes We have tentatively called such a selection back ground knowledge We will report such research in near future Next we would like to remark that the simple ohser vation that isomorphic relations have isomorphic patterns has a strong impact on the meaning of high frequency patterns Isomorphism is a syntactic notion it is highly probable that two isomorphic relations have totally differ ent semantics The patterns mined for one particular ap plication may contain patterns for other applications So relation with some additional structures need to be ex plored 23, 14 15 17 20 21 111 In particular, it implies that \224interesting-ness\224 of association tuples may need extra semantics the mere probability theory based on counting items may not be able to identify them we only give a sim ple example \(Section 9 more research will be reported in near future 11 Elementary Operations In this section, we do not assume the attributes are dis tinct The isomorphism of relations is reflexive, symmetric and transitive so it classifies all relations into equivalence classes we call them isomorphic classes Definition 11.1 H is a simplified information table of K if H is isomorphic to K and only has non-isomorphic at tributes Theorem 11.2 Let H be the simplified information table of K Then the patterns \(large itemsets of K can be obtained from those of H by elementary operations that will be de fined below To prove the Theorem we will set up a lemma in which we assume there are two isomorphic attributes B and B\222 in K that is. degree K  degree H I Let s  Dm\(B t Dom\(B\222 be the isomorphism and b\222  ZJ Let H be the new table in which B\222 has been removed Lemma 11.3. The patterns of K can be generated from those of H by elementary operations namely 1 If b is a large itemset in H then b\222 and \(h b\222 are large in K 2 If a _ b c   is a large itemset in H then a   b\222 c   and a   b b\222 c   are large in K 3 These are the only large itemsets in K The validity of this lemma is rather straightforward: and it provides the critical inductive step for Theorem we ill skip the proof References I R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami 224Mining Association Rules Between Sets of Items in Large Databases;\222 in Proceeding of ACM-SIGMOD interna tional Conference on Management of Data pp 207 216, Washington DC, June 1993 2 G Birkhoff and S MacLane A Survey of Modern Al gebra, Macmillan 1977  Richard A Brualdi, Introductory Combinatorics, Pren tice Hall 1992 141 Y.D Cai N Cercone and J Han Attribute-oriented induction in relational databases In Knowledge Dis covery in Databases, pages 213-228 AAAYMIT Press Cambridge.

Such a small mod ification to the original HPA algorithm could improve the linearity substantially 4.6 Effect of increasing transaction Figure 13 shows the effect of increasing transac tion database sue as the number of transactions is increased from 256,000 to 2 million transactions We used the data set t15.14 The behavior of the results does not change with increased database size The minimum support value was set to 0.4 The num ber of processors is kept at 16 As shown each of the parallel algorithms attains linearity 5 Summary and related work In this paper we proposed four parallel algorithms for mining association rules A summary of the four database size Sizeup 0 I 0 500 loo0 1500 uxw amount of transaction thousands Figure 13 Sizeup curve algorithms is shown in Table 5 In NPA the candi date itemsets are just copied amongst all the proces sors Each processor works on the entire candidate itemsets NPA requires no data transfer when the supports are counted However in the case where the entire candidate itemsets do not fit within the mem ory of a single processor the candidate itemsets are divided and the supports are counted by scanning the transaction database repeatedly Thus Disk 1/0 cost of NPA is high PDM, proposed in 6 is the same as NPA which copies the candidate itemsets among all the processors Disk 1/0 for PDM should be also high The remaining three algorithms SPA HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets over the memory space of all the processors Because it better exploits the total system's memory, disk 1/0 cost is low SPA arbitrarily partitions the candidate itemsets equally among the processors Since each processor broadcasts its local transaction data to all other pro cessors the communication cost is high HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets using a hash function which eliminates the need for transac tion data broadcasting and can reduce the comparison workload significantly HPA-ELD detects frequently occurring itemsets and handles them separately which can reduce the influence of the workload skew 6 Conclusions Since mining association rules requires several scans of the transaction file its computational requirements are too large for a single processor to have a reasonable response time This motivates our research In this paper we proposed four different parallel algorithms for mining association rules on a shared nothing parallel machine and examined their viabil 29 


Table 5 characteristics of algorithms ity through implementation on a 64 node parallel ma chine the Fujitsu AP1000DDV If a single processor can hold all the candidate item sets parallelization is straightforward It is just suf ficient to partition the transaction over the proces sors and for each processor to process the allocated transaction data in parallel We named this algo rithm NPA However when we try to do large scale data mining against a very large transaction file the candidate itemsets become too large to fit within the main memory of a single processor In addition to the size of a transaction file a small minimum support also increases the size of the candidate itemsets As we decrease the minimum support computation time grows rapidly but in many cases we can discover more interesting association rules SPA HPA and HPA-ELD not only partition the transaction file but partition the candidate itemsets among all the processors We implemented these al gorithms on a shard-nothing parallel machine Per formance evaluations show that the best algorithm HPA-ELD attains good linearity on speedup by fully utilizing all the available memory space which is also effective for skew handling At present we are doing the parallelization of mining generalized association rules described in 9 which includes the taxonomy is-a hierarchy Each item belongs to its own class hierarchy In such mining associations between the higher class and the lower class are also examined Thus the candidate itemset space becomes much larger and its computation time also takes even longer than the naive single level association mining Parallel pro cessing is essential for such heavy mining processing Acknowledgments This research is partially supported as a priority research program by ministry of education We would like to thank the F\221ujitsu Parallel Computing Research Center for allowing us to use their APlOOODDV sys tems References l R.Agrawal T.Imielinski and ASwami 223Min ing Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Manage ment of Data pp207-216 May 1993 2 R.Agrawal and RSrikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.487-499 September 1994 3 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223An Effec tive Hash-Based Algorithm for Mining Associ ation Rules\224 In Proc of the 1995 ACM SIG MOD International Conference on the Manage ment of Data SIGMOD Record Vo1.24 pp.175 186 June 1995 4 H.Mannila H.Toivonen and A.I.Verkamo 223Ef ficient Algorithms for Discovering Association Rules\224 In KDD-94:AAAI Workshop on Knowl edge Discovery in Databases pp.181-192 July 1994 5 A.Savasere, E.Omiecinski and S.Navathe 223An Effective Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 21th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.432-444 September 1995 6 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223Efficient Parallel Data Mining for Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 4th International Conference on In formation and Knowledge Management pp.31 36 November 1995 7 T.Shintani and M.Kitsuregawa 223Considera tion on Parallelization of Database Mining\224 In Institute of Electronics Information and Com munication Engineering Japan SIG CPS Y95 88 Technical Report Vo1.95 No.47 pp.57-62 December 1995 8 T.Shimizu T.Horie and H.Ishihata 223Perfor mance Evaluation of the APlOOO Effects of message handling broadcast and barrier syn chronization on benchmark performance-\224  In S WO PP 22292 9.2 ARC 95 Information Processing Society of Japan Vo1.92 No.64 1992 9 R.Srikant and R.Agrawal 223Mining Generalized Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 21th Inter national Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.407-419 September 1995 30
