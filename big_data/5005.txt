Madrid Madrid Spain emolina@est-econ.uc3m.es Yan Zhang Network Systems Department Simula Research Laboratory Oslo Norway yanzhang@simula.no Abstract 227We propose a novel anonymous access control protocol which is formulated as a series of coalitional games where the players are the owners of shared private resources big volumes of data in online social networks OSNs Basically coowners cooperate to generate by themselves an attribute-based boolean formula to control access to their shared resource By means of this boolean formula co-owners are able to secretly express their privacy preferences over a common shared resource and requesters can anonymously access the secured private resource In this paper we formally analyze our protocol's fairness from a cooperative game theory point of view and how OSN users which are mostly cooperative evaluate their expected gains and costs to adopt such cooperative privacy management scheme in many different settings Keywords Social networks coalitional game privacy-aware access control Shapley value system's fairness cooperative game theory I I NTRODUCTION Online social networks OSNs provide users with a form of self-expression and with a highly accessible channel for their interactions Recently the formation and structure of online social communities where users engage with each other in the sharing of mostly private data have attracted considerable research interest Studies are specially extensive in analyzing the evolution of such communities and the factors in\003uencing their rapid growth their structural features i.e shared content near locations trusted friendship connections etc the sociological aspects such as political and/or religious movements or professional factors to name a few 1  2   Cooperation and collectiveness are fundamental concepts for the success of OSNs however most proposals in this domain lack of a relevant analysis of the collaborative but rational nature of OSN users 3  M o r e o v e r  t h e r e e x i s t operations that are still addressed as local and individual processes For instance current OSN sites provide insuf\002cient and inaccurate controls to restrict data sharing hindering users from applying appropriate 002ne-grained access policies over who may view their shared data 4  5   A n d m o r e importantly users have limited control over the privacy settings applied by other users to the shared private data 6  A s a c o n s e q u e n c e  t h e p r i v a c y p r e f e r e n c e s o f u s e r s w h o share contents may be con\003icting In this work we focus on the cooperative game underlying the cooperation-based management of user privacy preferences in OSNs In this regard a simple analytical model based on Cooperative Game Theory provides us with a metric to evaluate the feasibility of the formation of coalitions in OSNs i.e groups of allied users the owners joining forces together to protect a shared private content We introduce an anonymous access control protocol which the game theoretical framework is built upon Basically throughout our protocol co-owners of a common private resource for instance a collection of documents a photo album or a collection of movies will be able to de\002ne in a joint and distributed manner the policies to control the anonymous access to the common resource Motivational examples range from a large number of attendants to a conference who wish to share testimonial photos or articles of the event to a small group of friends sharing summer pictures A Related Work Cooperation-based approaches to privacy protection in OSNs have been slightly tackled 6  3   T r a d i t i o n a l l y  p r i vacy in OSNs has been addressed as a matter of locally and manually introducing personal privacy preferences most in the way of expressions built over generic predicates referring either to user set of attributes or to a set of content categories 6  7   I n t h i s s c e n a r i o  u s e r s c a n i n d i v i d u a l l y dictate access control policies which can be implemented by using different languages like XML-based languages Although non-cooperative several access control schemes have been recently proposed in OSNs based on public key cryptography For example resources access control lists ACLs which contain the owner's public key the public keys of the members who can access the resource and the social relationship amongst the members have been applied to de\002ne different levels of access to the resource 5  8   A decentralized and collaborative rule-based access control for OSNs is proposed in 3  I n t h i s c a s e  a c c e s s 


2 conditions are a function of the relationship type depth and trust level between providers and requesters Owners issue and sign statements on these properties using relationship certi\002cates based on what authors called 223onion signatures\224 Moreover the application of game theory to analyze the rational behavior of the participants in OSNs has been sparse To the best of our knowledge only a few works have modeled so far the formation of coalitions in OSNs in an appropriately de\002ned cooperative game In particular an interesting work to address co-ownership in OSNs is proposed in 6  w h e r e C l a r k e T a x v o t i n g p r o t o c o l w a s a d o p t e d to enable the collective enforcement of access policies for shared contents Individual preferences are aggregated in the group policy using a voting procedure which maximizes the global social utility and promotes fairness encouraging truthfulness among the co-owners Finally the work presented in 9 d e a l s w i t h t h e a n a l y s i s of the structure of the relationships that exist among the nodes in a social network towards determining how the information spreads in the network Algorithms proposed are based on the Shapley values of the nodes to compute their in\003uence in the network Another approach which explores the cooperation of nodes in OSNs is described in 10 t o study the structural and communication patterns aimed at predicting the links that are likely to appear in the future B Our Contribution This article offers the following main 002ndings contributing to any previous related work as follows On the one hand our access control protocol completely differs from the aforementioned approaches in OSNs since it is based on a fully decentralized anonymous credential system In particular the anonymous credential system presented in Persiano et al.'s work 11 i s c o m b i n e d a n d a d j u s t e d t o r e c e n t advances in dealer-less secret sharing 12 m e c h a n i s m s and threshold RSA signatures 13  B r i e 003 y  o w n e r s o f a shared private resource can secretly express their privacy preferences over that resource and control external access by means of an attribute-based boolean formula which is de\002ned involving every owner Additionally owners must collaborate in granting access to the resource requesters Finally the protocol preserves anonymity and unlinkability of requesters accessing a common shared resource who must prove in a zero-knowledge fashion that their attributes satisfy the boolean formula which protects the resource On the other hand the formal analysis of the proposed protocol requires the study of the coalition formation comprising all co-owners We formally give foundations of how the proposed cooperative protocol might induce the formation of an stable group of participants To the best of our knowledge no work has focused yet on cooperation\226 based privacy\226aware access control for OSNs from a coalitional game point of view which includes considerations for the fairness of such cooperative coalitions Furthermore all social networking systems impose on every participant certain constrains in terms of engagement with time and/or computational capabilities Novel to the related work is also the capacity of our formal analysis to capture and interpret the differences in the hardware used by entities when connecting to the social network smartphones low capabilities PCs high capabilities and the different types of users beginners buddies socializers etc Organization The rest of this article is organized as follows In Section II the main phases of our protocol are described in detail Additionally Section III introduces a formal analysis of the proposed protocol by applying coalitional games Section IV describes the results of the fairness of our protocol in different scenarios Finally in Section V some 002nal conclusions and research directions are established II C OOPERATION BASED A NONYMOUS A CCESS C ONTROL P ROTOCOL In this section we introduce a cooperation-based anonymous access control protocol for OSNs which is based on the Persiano et al.'s anonymous credential system 11  I n Persiano et al.'s work a user obtains a multi-show credential from a central organization and uses it in a zero-knowledge fashion to gain access to the resources which are restricted to authorized users Our proposal eliminates the organization role and allows a group of co-owners to issue RSA-signed access credentials to requesters in a fully decentralized way We start describing the roles performed by the actors of our protocol and its phases A Roles The protocol de\002nes four different roles 017 Founder a user who participates in the system set-up to jointly generate all the necessary parameters to execute the protocol 017 Owner or co-owner a Founder user who joins a coalition of co-owners to generate the access control policy of a shared private resource 030  017 Signer an Owner that cooperates with other co-owners of the same resource 030  on the construction of user anonymous credentials to access 030  017 Requester a user who having been issued an anonymous credential by a group of signers makes use of it to anonymously access 030  B Phases Our protocol consists of four phases as follows 1 System Set-Up  A community of n founders comes together to generate all the global parameters required by Persiano et al.'s system 11 w h i c h c o n s i s t o f p u b l i c l y v e r i 002 a b l e 1 1 Publicly Veri\002able Secret Sharing plays an important role in the design of protocols for secure multi-party computation as everybody is able to verify that the shares have been correctly distributed 


3 parameters and the corresponding private information that is used to issue credentials to requesters Thus we distribute the process of generating such global parameters between the n founders by applying the algorithm Joint Random Secret Sharing 2 JRSS detailed in 12 Section 6.3  B a s i c a l l y  t h e n founders are able to generate in a joint and decentralized manner all the RSA elements described in 11 Section 4.2 System Set-up  As a result of this phase each founder i holds a tuple P ub i containing all the public parameters and a tuple P riv i containing all private parameters for each founder In particular P riv i contains shares of all private values allowing a group of at least  t  1 owners with t  n  to jointly use their shares and generate valid signatures in the Credential Assignment phase Parameter t is the threshold security parameter 3 of our protocol which applies the RSA  t n  threshold signature scheme 4 proposed in 13  2 Policy Establishment  In this phase the co-owners of a shared resource 030 form a coalition to jointly generate the access control policy for 030  For instance from a propositional logic point of view an access control policy can be represented by a linear boolean formula over the speci\002c predicates and/or variables or a conjunction of them and their relations for a certain resource The semantics attached to de\002ning predicates should be adapted to each speci\002c case such as age gender nationality and af\002liation to name a few In a general setting the owners of a given resource 030 may de\002ne an access policy  030 as a linear equation in a series of predicates  x 1      x l   For simplicity reasons we assume users to hold two attributes  x 1  x 2   Also for simplicity purposes in our work 030 s co-owners secretly and jointly generate two integer values 013 and f as a way to express their privacy preferences over resource 030  013 and f are generated by executing the JRSS 12 Section 6.3  T h e reasons behind the generation of these parameters in a joint and secret manner are mainly two 1 Resource owners can secretly impose privacy preferences on the access to their private common resources co-owners will learn nothing about each others preferences and 2 the resulting parameters are the combination of the 2 The implications of deploying threshold-based secret sharing in a distributed online social network have been recently tackled in 14  I n particular the JRSS algorithm allows n parties to jointly generate a random integer secret value r with no information about r revealed to any party or coalition of at most t parties 3 The security parameter is chosen amongst the group of co-owners of a particular private resource However experiments in Section IV show how the value t in\003uences the system and the expected gain of each participant 4 A number of  t  1 nodes each holding a valid private key share can generate partial signatures which can be

a new user the access This phase will be formalized as a coalitional game in Section III preferences of all owners Furthermore we represent access policies as straight lines in two variables such that  030  x 1  x 2   1  013x 1  f  x 2  Finally  030 is made public 3 Credential Assignment  The procedure used to provide a user U with a valid 5 anonymous access credential AAC U  to gain authorization on 030  works as follows U asks a coowner R  known as the sponsor  for the access to 030  so it is assumed that U and R have already built social connections i.e U belongs to R s trust circle Thus R involves at least t more co-owners in signing the AAC U  The following steps take place see Figure 1 1 R veri\002es if U s attributes  x 1  x 2  are valid according to the predicates established in  030  If veri\002cation succeeds R creates a friend-requestmessage  namely M   U m  is f riend 00   where m represents the cryptographic material required in 11 Section 4.2 User enrollment to generate a valid user credential M is sent to every other co-owner of 030  In step 2 each co-owner i also called signer signs 6 the received message m using his share of the RSA private key encoded in P riv i and issues his partial signature 033 i  m  to R  Next in 3 R collects t partial signatures performs its own partial signature on m and generates a valid AAC U  Finally in the step 4 R secretly sends AAC U to U  From this moment onwards U can access 030  via any participant providing 030  in an anonymous manner and as often as required without being identi\002ed linked or traced 5 AAC U is valid if it encodes a tuple of attributes  x 1  x 2  that satisfy the control policy  030  i.e  030  x 1  x 2   1  Further details on the mathematical basis of the algorithms on which our protocol is based as well as their formal proofs are given in the cited publications 6 The algorithm to construct a valid RSA signature from  t  1 partial signatures and the veri\002cation procedure can be found in 13 Section III.A  


4 4 Resource Access  In this phase to avoid traceability and linkability every single time that a consumer user U  who wants to gain access to 030  must generate and commit to a new set of session secret random values together with commitments on the credential AAC U  Thus once U has constructed and sent the corresponding commitments to one of the co-owners P providing 030  U and P engage in the following four zero\226knowledge proofs of knowledge ZKPoKs to prove the following statements i U proves that the private attributes  x 1  x 2  encoded in its AAC U satisfy the boolean formula  030  x 1  x 2   1  without disclosing the actual attribute values  x 1  x 2   ii proves that all the session values and commitments are valid and fresh to the actual instance of the Resource Access phase so no message is being relayed iii proves that the signature on AAC U is valid without disclosing the credential AAC U  and iv proves that U knows a newly chosen session value y involved in all the previous the ZKPoKs and commitments This session value is newly and randomly chosen by U in each instance of the Resource Access phase and offers unlinkability between two different access sessions We refer the reader to 11 Section 4.2 Showing possession of credentials for a complete description of this phase C Discussion Note that our protocol endorses the following important properties 017 Scalability on the number of resources A user can use its AAC i to anonymously and unlinkably gain access to either a single private shared resource or a collection of resources which share both the access policy and the group of owners 017 Scalability on the number of access control policies Since access control policies are represented as curves in the plane a tuple of attributes could be at the intersection of two or more of these curves satisfying two or more policies This way owners can construct a hierarchy of policies without having to issue new credentials to all request users 017 Scalability on the number of owners The system does nor present restrictions on the maximum number of coowners of the same common resource 017 Security threshold parameter t  The security parameter is chosen amongst the group of co-owners of a particular private resource However experiments in Section IV show how the value t in\003uences the system and the expected gain of each participant In the following section we apply Cooperative Game Theory principles to construct a coherent framework and also to provide a formal analysis of the proposed protocol phases More precisely we characterize the existing cooperative requirements in the System Set-up and Policy Establishment phases as coalitional games in which it is reasonable to assume that players the owners would converge to forming the grand coalition involving all players Furthermore we also formalize the Credential Assignment phase as a cooperative game using the Shapley value of each player in the game to evaluate and analyze the different outcomes The properties inherent to the Shapley value will allow us to make an estimation on the feasibility of the protocol and the different possible outcomes for many different real-life settings III G AME T HEORETICAL A NALYSIS We describe the game theoretical framework assuming that the involved owners who form a coalition can reach binding agreements to enforce coordinated behavior In that case we also assume that they can share the bene\002ts derived from the execution of the protocol or the system globally The analysis will be performed by representing every system phase as a separate cooperative game with transferable utility a TU game The System Set-up  Policy Establishment and Resource Access phases are represented by simple games 7 in which the only 223winning\224 coalition is the grand coalition when all owners collaborate Indeed non cooperative behavior in any of the aforementioned phases will prevent our protocol from completion In this article we do not formalize the study of those two simple games By contrast our focus will be placed on the Credential Assignment phase where a group of  t 1 owners is the minimum coalition required to sign friend-request-messages  In particular we represent the Credential Assignment phase as a TU game in characteristic function form Furthermore we de\002ne the notion of value and in particular we rely on the Shapley value to provide a fair evaluation of the game played by different types of participants In the Credential Assignment TU game that we de\002ne not only the individual gains resulting from cooperation are taken into account but also the cost and other parameters such as the number of friends expected to require access to the resource etc In other words since some players may contribute more to the coalition than others or may possess different bargaining power it is needed to measure how important each player is to the overall cooperation and what payoff can he or she reasonably expect These measurements will let us reason about the suitability and rationality of our protocol real deployment 7 Simple games represent situations in which

5 A Cooperative Game Theory and Shapley Value In game theory a cooperative game with transferable utility is a game where groups of players coalitions enforce the cooperation and coordination of the members of the coalition and dictate the group behavior Thus a coalition of players cooperates and obtains a certain overall gain from that cooperation Moreover if the players have a common currency that is valued equally by all then the overall gains can freely be transferred among themselves Formally De\002nition 1 Cooperative Games with transferable utility TU games  An n 226player cooperative game in characteristic function form with transferable utility TU game is an ordered pair  N v   where N is a 002nite set of n  j N j players and v  2 N  R is a map assigning a real number v  S   called the value of S  to every possible coalition of players S 022 N  and where v     0  The real number v  S  represents the reward that coalition S can achieve by itself if all its members act together As previously mentioned since some players may contribute more to the coalition than others or may possess different bargaining power it is needed to measure how important is each player to the overall cooperation and what payoff can he or she reasonably expect Formally let  N v  be a given TU game the question to be answered is to determine how the power is distributed over the agents involved in a situation One possible answer to this question is given by the notion of Shapley value 15  De\002nition 2 Shapley value for TU games  Let  N v  be an n 226player cooperative game in characteristic function form with transferable utility then the Shapley value is a function b   N v   R n that associates  N v  a vector b N v  whose i th component is given by the formula b i  N v   X S 022 N i  2 S 020 s  n 000 s 000 1 n  021 000 v  S  f i g  000 v  S  001  1 8 i  1      n where s  j S j denotes the cardinality of coalition S 022 N  The Shapley value is an index for measuring the power of players in a game It computes for each player the average marginal contributions  mc i  S   v  S  f i g  000 v  S   in all possible coalitions Regarding the Shapley value's ability to promote fairness Myerson 16 c h a r a c t e r i z e s t h e S h a p l e y v a l u e a s t h e unique ef\002cient symmetric value verifying the balanced contributions property Thus we have the following properties 017 Ef\002ciency  implies that the vector of values exactly splits the total payoff of the game v  N   X i 2 N b i  N v  017 Symmetry  implies symmetric players to be paid equal shares If i j 2 N are symmetric  v  S  f i g   v  S  f j g   for all S 022 N n f i j g  then b i  N v   b j  N v  017 Balanced Contributions  implies that player i contributes to player j s payoff what player j contributes to player i s payoff 8 i j 2 N b i  N v  000 b i  N n f j g  v j N n f j g    b j  N v  000 b j  N n f i g  v j N n f i g   where  N n f j g  v j N n f j g  is the TU game played by N n f j g players B The Credential Assignment Phase as a TU Game In this section a Credential Assignment TU game is de\002ned to represent the Credential Assignment phase The characteristic function will be determined by the total expected gain from the cooperation of  t  1 owners signing a new user's access request i.e the bene\002ts of protecting the resource minus the costs imposed by running the process of signing credentials Additionally the function will also capture the level of satisfaction achieved by the members of the coalition when the system is operating according to their expectations 1 Assumptions We assume the following hypothesis in order to constitute the characteristic function and players payoffs Assumption 1 Gain  A successful execution of the Credential Assignment phase gives owners the opportunity of executing their privacy requirements on common shared resources and then preventing from non-authorized access Since every owner is cooperative a value b i will represent the gain for each participant i 2 N in signing new friendrequest-messages for friends of other coalition members This payoff captures the cooperative nature and the interest of player i to assist other allied members friends Assumption 2 Costs  A successful execution of the Credential Assignment phase involves players in incurring a computational and communication cost by signing friendrequest-messages of other coalition members for a given resource and owner The cost of signing one of these messages is denoted by c i which depends on each owner's platform i.e PC smartphone Assumption 3 Global individual gain  A successful execution of the Credential Assignment phase gives owners a personal utility u i  which represents the gain for participant i 2 N taking into account that the overall system is operating in a regular 003ow The value u i represents the gain for each participant expecting friend-request-messages initiated by their own friends to be signed by the rest of the 


6 co-owners It also represents the overall level of satisfaction or consideration for the global functioning of the protocol Assumption 4 Friendship connections  The value 000 i represents the number of friends that player i has and that are entitled to initiate the Credential Assignment phase by requesting i to collect enough signatures on the friendrequest-message generated 2 Credential Assignment Game Characteristic Function If a participant i 2 N acts as the sponsor for one of his friends U  then i involves a group S 022 N of co-owners in signing the anonymous credential We de\002ne the total gain of S by g  S   8     0  if j S j 6 t u i  X j 2 S j 6  i  b j 000 c j   if j S j  t being j S j  t 1  where t is the threshold security parameter de\002ned in Section II Otherwise its total gain equals 0 since coalition S is not able to generate the necessary material to construct an anonymous access credential However since a highly connected owner with high number of friendship connections will act as an sponsor with a high probability we de\002ne the expected total gain E of each coalition S 022 N as follows E  g  S   P i 2 S 000 i 000 N  003 020 u i  P j 2 S j 6  i  b j 000 c j  021  P i 2 S 020 000 i 000 N  u i  000 S n i  000 N   b i 000 c i  021  2 where 000 S n i   P j 2 S j 6  i 000 j  We get to de\002ne the Credential Assignment TU-Game  N v  with player set N  f 1  001 001 001  n g  and the characteristic function given by v  S   8   0  if j S j 6 t X i 2 S 020 000 i 000 N  u i  000 S n i  000 N   b i 000 c i  021  if j S j  t Proposition 1 Let  N v  be the Credential Assignment TUgame previously de\002ned then its Shapley value is given by b i  v    n 000 t  n 000 i u i 000 N   t n  n 000 1 n X j 1 j 6  i 000 j u j 000 N   t  t 000 1 n  n 000 1 n 000 2 001 001 n X j 1 j 6  i j 000 1 X  1  6  i 022 000  000 N   b j 000 c j   000 j 000 N   b  000 c   023   1 2 022 1 000 t  t 000 1 n  n 000 1 023 020 000 N n i  000 N   b i 000 c i   000 i 000 N  n X j 1 j 6  i  b j 000 c j  021  for all i  1      n  For the sake of completeness we include the mathematical proof for the computation of the Shapley value in Appendix A 3 Discussion The interpretation of the Shapley value of each entity involved in the protocol is related to the proportion on the part of that entity of the total cost or losses in terms of global resources consumed or invested when running one single instance of the protocol The Shapley value provides fairness to the distribution of the total bene\002t or cost gained or spent globally for the functioning of the system amongst the members of a coalition In other words each entity should contribute to the total amount of global cost overhead or resources needed to execute the protocol successfully according to the proportion dictated by its own Shapley value Thus in our particular setting the following relations can be established 017 Any increase in any of the 000 i values increases the Shapley value of player i  Indeed increasing the number of friends of any of the members of a coalition increases the global cost of the system e.g in terms of time for executing the protocol The entity imposing such extra cost should then assume a bigger proportion of it 017 An increase in any of the c i values decreases the Shapley value of player i  A participant with a high individual signing cost is individually contributing more to the global functioning of the system than other participants with lower individual costs Therefore the former should be compensated by the coalition by reducing the proportion i has to pay of the global system cost 017 An increase in any of the b i values increases the Shapley value of player i  A participant bene\002ting more than the rest when signing single credentials is clearly more interested on the global functioning and operability of the system In those terms it should assume a bigger proportion of the overall overhead cost than the less interested players 017 An increase in any of the u i values increases the Shapley value of player i  Similarly deriving bigger bene\002t than the rest from the signing of one own friend's credentials implies a greater interest on the execution of the protocol and this implies other participants can force this one to assume a bigger proportion of the global system overhead cost IV O UTCOME OF THE F ORMALISM In this section corresponding to the scope of this paper and as a way to illustrate the outcome of our formalism for the Credential Assignment phase we choose a series of small communities which allow us to individually analyze and predict the expected contribution of different types of rational participants to the overall system Note that the actual implementation and evaluation of the system is out of the scope of this work
