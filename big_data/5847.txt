Extending Summation Precision for Network Reduction Operations 
Double precision summation is at the core of numerous important algorithms such as Newton-Krylov methods and other operations involving inner products but the effectiveness of summation is limited by the accumulation of rounding errors which are an increasing problem with the scaling of modern HPC systems and data sets To reduce the impact of precision loss researchers have proposed increased

and arbitrary-precision libraries that provide reproducible error or even bounded error accumulation for large sums but do not guarantee an exact result Such libraries can also increase computation time signiìcantly We propose big integer BigInt expansions of double precision variables that enable arbitrarily large summations

years have led to larger datasets and extreme parallelism for high performance computing HPC systems It is projected that parallelism will increase at an exponential pace in order to meet the communityês computational and power efìciency goals This translates to operations such as summations with a larger number of operands that are also distributed over an increasing number of nodes The sheer scale of these systems threatens the numerical stability of core algorithms due to the accumulation of errors for ubiquitous global arithmetic operations such as summations At the present time 64-bit IEEE oating-point arithmetic is sufìciently accurate for most scientiìc applications However for a rapidly growing body of important 
scientiìc applications higher numeric precision is required Among those applications are computations with large relatively ill-conditioned linear systems multi-processor largescale simulations atmospheric models supernova simulations Coulomb

summations such as matrix multiplications and dot products As an example of a real-world application where accurate summation is important Y He and C Ding analyzed anomalous behavior in large atmospheric model codes wherein signiìcantly different results were obtained on different systems or even the same system with a different numbers of processors As a result code maintenance w as an issue since it was often difìcult to ensure that a bug was not introduced when porting the code to another system Another concrete example is complex dynamical systems where precision loss has been quoted as the main limitation Currently researchers generally presume that nothing can be done to ameliorate such problems and are often concerned with bounding errors from precision loss to acceptable 
levels 9 10 11 12 13 A fe w ha v e tried higher precision arithmetic using software facilities with relatively good success although computational time for this software is often an issue 15 In the atmospheric model case mentioned above researchers employed double-double DD arithmetic in the summations which uses two doubleprecision variables to extend precision and found that almost all numerical variations were eliminated Others have even resorted to quad-double arithmetic 14 In modern HPC systems with large datasets summations and other operations are often performed on operands distributed across the network 1 Currently none of the high-precision software libraries support parallel sum 
mations Balanced-tree summations and other sorting or recursion algorithms that reduce round-off error accumulation 15 9 12 are only ef cient within nodes because they would incur an impractical amount of systemwide data movement for distributed operations This leaves distributed operations prone to precision loss There are two natural ways to implement distributed summations with provably minimum data movement One way is for nodes to send their partial sum a single variable to a single node to perform the summation and generate a single result This only occupies a single nodeês processor

but completion time grows linearly with the number of operands and can also create network hotspots The other approach used in most MPI implementations performs the summation in a tree fashion where each node adds a number of operands and passes the partial sum also a single variable to the next level of the tree This approach requires logarithmic time to complete but the latencies of each level of the tree greatly impact performance at scale as it incurs multiple communication delays between network interface cards NICs and local processors Software implementations incur potentially long context switch penalties just to have processors at each node add a few numbers together and may also cause these intermediate processors to wake up from potentially deep sleep Earlier work proposes NIC-based reductions in Myrinet networks by modifying the dri v ers and therefore using the host processorês processing power and showed that NIC-based reduction can yield performance gains even with as few as eight nodes Further w ork e v aluated conducting reduction operations exclusively in NICs and concluded that doing so increases efìciency scalability and reduces execution time compared to performing the computations in processors This is made possible by using the programmable logic in modern NICs Ho we v er  this w ork only applied this method for double-precision variables due to the complex data structures and computation demands of arbitrary-precision libraries and the limited processing power of programmable logic in NICs Even with double-precision variables the low computational power of programmable logic can pose a signiìcant performance issue The alternative adding complex dedicated hardware to NICs for increased or arbitrary precision computations increases design risk and complexity In this paper we make the case that using a very wide integer to provide an uncompressed and exact encoding of the complete numerical space that can be represented by a double-precision oating point number which we call big integer BigInt is well-suited for distributed operations We demonstrate that BigInts incur no precision loss and can be productive and efìcient to use in distributed summations such as reduction operations without increasing communication latency compared to double-precision variables In fact this approach offers the promise of actually accelerating system-wide summations used by inner products for methods such as Newton-Krylov because integer adders can be easily incorporated in NICs at speeds comparable to modern oating point units FPUs to avoid waking up and context switching processors Therefore we are able to move computation from the processor to the NIC without any precision or performance loss This was previously possible only with double-precision variables due to the complex internal structures of arbitrary-precision libraries Even though the size of a BigInt variable is 2101 bitsÑ33 larger than a 64bit double-precision variableÑwe observe insigniìcant loss Figure 1 Double long double and double-double variables in communication delay due to the xed latency costs and packet overhead bytes in modern large-scale networks Therefore BigInts readily apply to network operations and can be combined with past work on local-node computations that uses sorting and recursion or alternative wide xedpoint representations with dedicated hardware support  15 in order to pro vide reproducible system-wide operations with no precision loss II B ACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK The format of double-precision variables is set by the IEEE 754 standard and is sho wn in Figure 1 F or double-precision variables the total number of bits is 64 including the most signiìcant bit which is the sign The mantissa includes a silent bit at its most signiìcant 53rd position which is 1 if the exponent is non-zero Doubleprecision variables with a zero exponent are considered denormalized and are used to ll the gaps in the numbers that double-precision variables can represent close to zero A denormalized double-precision variable encodes the number If the exponent is non-zero the number is considered normalized and a bias of 1023 is applied to the exponent value Therefore an exponent value of 50 represents an actual exponent of  The decimal value of a normalized double is Normalized doubles encode numbers in the range However because of the limited mantissa bits doubleprecision variables cannot represent all numbers in the above range In addition operating on numbers that have signiìcantly different exponent values causes bits to be dropped For example adding the numbers and

where causes the latter number to be dropped because the 53 mantissa bits are not enough to retain both numbers Even if the smaller number is not small enough to be fully discarded it may have to be partly discarded for the same reason or the result may require more than 53 mantissa bits Such precision loss is hard to predict in many applications and can appear with just two operands In a large summation this error accumulates in every sum of two numbers and therefore in a summation with millions or billions of operands the error may rise to unacceptable levels 7 5 6 Double-precision variables are fully supported in hardware with dedicated FPUs in modern processors The y also include special values to represent inìnity and a result that is not a number NaN as well as exceptions to set variables to those values when appropriate 26 Modern architectures include support for long double variables In the IEEE 754 standard this is referred to as double-extended precision for which the byte width is 10 and translates to 19 or 20 decimal digits In an x86 architecture long doubles are 80-bits long with 64-bit mantissas and 15-bit exponents x86 processors include dedicated registers with this format but the extra precision is lost once a long double variable is written back to memory In the past 10 years or so high-precision software packages have been produced which typically utilize custom datatypes and operator overloading to facilitate conversion One example is the QD package which pro vides DD variables where each 16-byte variable is the unevaluated sum of two 8-byte doubles of which the rst consists of the leading digits and the second the trailing digits of the formatês value That is the rst double contains the best 64-bit double-precision approximation to the answer and the second double contains the difference between the exact answer and the rst double Similarly a quad-double number is an unevaluated sum of four IEEE doubles However while such packages offer easy-to-use high-level interfaces they still offer a limited amount of precision For arbitrary precision packages such as ARPREC and GNU GMP are a v ailable Other packages of fer guarantees on the order of operations and rounding since there is no standard Ine vitably  these packages sacriìce speed and memory due to large arrays used in the internal representations and lack of hardware support Formats with variable-length mantissas have also been proposed such as IEEE 854 Such formats are similar to doubleprecision variables because they use mantissa and exponent elds but they also introduce additional complexity for operations and exception handling that make hardware support costly Finally wide xed-point representations similar to BigInts have been used in hardware accumulators for localnode summations 23 15 BigInts e xtend this w ork by applying this concept on distributed summations We found that existing software solutions are usually  slow for most physical modeling and simulation codes and the precision provided by DDs or quad-doubles are insufìcient especially for much larger simulations to come A DD summation requires approximately 20 operations all performed in processor registers which results in an approximately 2 to 5 slowdown compared to doubleprecision variables This slo wdo wn becomes w orse when using arbitrary-precision packages As an example ARPREC is approximately 2.5 to 4.5 slower than DD multiplication on a Sun Ultra 167 MHz processor  Alternati v e algorithms use sorting recursion or other computation or data movement overhead to provide exact results or with tight error bounds as well as reproducibility 10 9 Due to their o v erhead such algorithms are only practical within nodes Because of the performance tradeoff some researchers settle with bounding or predicting the computation error 9 10 11 12 13 III D ESCRIPTION Figure 2 illustrates the format of a BigInt variable Essentially BigInt variables remove the exponent eld and expand the mantissa such that each bitês location corresponds to an exponent value To represent the same number space as the IEEE double-precision format BigInt variables need to be 2101 bits since the 11-bit exponent eldês value ranges from 0 to 2048 and the exponent deìnes the value of the most signiìcant silent mantissa bit Thus the lowest exponent value BigInt needs to represent is the lowest value of the exponent eld   minus the number of mantissa bits 53 for a total of  BigInt variables also have a sign bit which we place in the least signiìcant position Like integers BigInts are an uncompressed representation and therefore can exactly encode the full range of real numbers in their number space In other words there is no gap in the range of numbers that are expressible by BigInts In addition BigInts do not introduce any precision loss Therefore they are well-suited for very large summations Figure 3 shows how a normalized double-precision variable maps to a BigInt To convert from a denormalized double the most signiìcant bit of the doubleês mantissa is inserted in position 53 corresponding to exponent value  This does not overwrite the sign bit of BigInt because denormalized oats do not have a silent bit Converting the summation result from a BigInt back to a double long double or DD variable inevitably causes the

Figure 3 A double-precision variable maps to a BigInt by inserting the most signiìcant bit of the mantissa the silent bit if set in the position speciìed by the exponent For example an exponent of 1000 encodes an actual exponent of after applying the bias Therefore the silent bit is inserted in position  The rest of the mantissa is inserted in adjacent less signiìcant positions least signiìcant asserted bits to be dropped if the distance between the leftmost and rightmost asserted bits in the BigInt is more than the length of the mantissa of the variable the BigInt is converted to For example when converting to a double-precision variable a BigInt with asserted bits at locations 100 and 10 the least signiìcant bit will inevitably be dropped because  If this precision loss is of concern to the application programmers can retain BigInt or use another wide xed-point for local-node summation similar to past work 23 15 or use an y of the higher-precision formats or libraries such as recursion and sorting methods ARPEC QD and GMP 14 29  10 9 It is k e y to realize that the con v ersion back to lower-precision formats discussed above is performed only for the nal result or for local node processing if at all The nal result is guaranteed to be accurate as long as all arithmetic is performed with BigInt precision Performing the entire operation with precision less than BigInt may produce an entirely different result due to precision loss in every summation of two numbers as discussed in Section II this effect accumulates over the course of large summations This precision loss can result in the most signiìcant bits of the result the bits well within the range of even doubleprecision variables to differ compared to the result produced by BigInt because BigInt was able to correctly and exactly capture the contributions of all operands without losses The simplicity of BigInts enables fast and accurate numerics for software implementations and requires only simple logic for hardware implementations for large summations 23 V ery little additional memory is required because only partial sums are projected to BigInt instead of all operands and only over the network for distributed operations BigInt variables can be treated as long integers for addition multiplication and division even though they represent oating point numbers Adding two BigInts can be accomplished with simple and inexpensive integer adders in a sequential manner an adder of N bits length requires cycles Therefore in order to match the latency of a highly-optimized FPU in modern Intel processors which has a 5-cycle latency the adder width needs to be 421 bits This makes adding hardware support for BigInts feasible and more likely to operate at comparable speeds to the node processors in contrast to more complex libraries that also offer arbitrary precision BigInts of all 0s but with a sign bit of 1 represents not a real number NaN A value of all 1s refers to inìnity Inf used for numbers outside of the representable number space In this case the sign bit distinguishes between positive and negative inìnity similar to IEEE 754 26 Setting a BigInt to inìnity or NaN is done by the hardware logic through simple checks without the need for exceptions as in the IEEE 754 format For example the result of a summation is inìnity if the addition of the most signiìcant bits of two BigInts produces a carry Similarly in multiplications the resulting BigInt is set to inìnity if the result is wider than the BigInt A BigInt of all 0s is the number 0 BigInts are good candidates for network-wide operations such as MPI reductions where communication follows a treelike fashion and every node sums the operands it receives and then transmits the partial sum a single number to the next level of the tree to produce a single result  34 That is because the additional bits do not ha v e a noticeable effect in communication delay for a small number of operands as we show in Section V-D Past work has shown that performing computation in the NICs during reduction operations increases both scalability and consistency with speedups of up to 121 Ho we v er  this has only been applied to double-precision variables because of the complex data structures of libraries with arbitrary precision and the limited programmable logic in terms of both area and clock frequency in modern NICs For instance Elan3 in Quadrics QsNet provides a userprogrammable multi-threaded 32-bit 100MHz RISC-based processor with 64 MB local SDRAM originally targeted for communication protocol modiìcations This processor is an order of magnitude slower than the multi-GHz node processors Similar work which implemented the computation logic in software drivers in a Myrinet network showed that NIC-based reductions can be preferable to hostbased serial reductions with as few as eight nodes The only way to offer high-speed computation in NICs without BigInts is to add dedicated high-speed oatingpoint computation hardware to NICs The power and area consumed by a fully functional double-precision adder is substantial In addition including a full oating point into the NIC increases design complexity to a point that drastically increases design risk for a very specialized function An example of the simplest double-precision FPU from the Tensilica design library requires on the order of 150,000 gates Ev en though FPU units support multiplication as well as addition and therefore would be partially unused in

a distributed summation oating point multiplication is less complicated to implement than addition V eriìcation is non-trivial for even a circuit of this size and complexity and this implementation is among the simplest available For future Inìniband 4x EDR interface theoretical peak bandwidth operands would need to be summed at a rate of 100 Gigabits/sec This would require a 32-bit carrylookahead adder operating at 0.6 GHz very modest clock rate Operating as a ripple-carry this would require 66 cycles to graduate a result and consume about 380 gates for the adder a negligible amount of area and power For reduction operations with both local and networkwide computations local computations can either use sorting or recursion techniques or use wide xed-point representations with dedicated hardware support Alternatively local computations can be performed in the NICs using the BigInt format without using the local processor However because this option would transfer all local operands to the NIC instead of just the partial sum it stresses the processorÖNIC interconnect Network-wide computations are performed in the NIC with BigInts because sorting or recursion techniques would produce an excessive amount of system-wide data movement This way there is no precision loss in both local and distributed operations Local computations can be performed in advance of the arrival of packets with partial sums such that when the reduction operation function call is made the result a single partial sum number can be stored in the NIC in anticipation of other partial sums operands IV M ETHODOLOGY We evaluate the impact of BigInts on computation precision and performance of summations and MPI reduction operations with millions to billions of operands W e rst evaluate the numerical behavior and error accumulation of techniques applicable to network-wide operations namely doubles long doubles DDs and BigInts using serial test cases on large numbers of operands Next we evaluate the performance of operations on payload sizes required for these different extended precision implementations Lastly we estimate the impact of embedding BigInt summations into the NIC for future interconnect designs Numerical stability calculations are done in a single processor as they are designed entirely to understand the numerical behavior of different approaches Each trial uses exclusively operands and operations of the appropriate precision In our architecture long double-precision variables are 80 bits long where 1 bit is the sign 15 bits are for the exponent and 64 bits for the mantissa W e report the error of each precision type against BigInt as a percentage We also perform a bitwise comparison of the mantissa of each precision type against BigInt and report the rst bit that differs Due to the different representation with two double-precision variables that DDs use we do not report bit-wise mantissa comparison results for DDs Finally we Figure 4 One benchmark is calculating the arc length of this highly irregular function g\(x perform a comparison of decimal digits of each variable in decimal form and report the position of the rst decimal digit that differs For example the numbers 2.54 and 2.58 differ in the second decimal digit For both decimal and bit comparisons a value of minus one means that there is no difference whereas a value of 0 means that the integer parts of the numbers differ in the decimal comparison Initially we perform a composite summation of numerous equal small numbers to a large number We vary the large and small numbers as well as the number of operands to illustrate precision loss as a function of summation size and operand values We then show results for a calculation that attempts to calculate the arc length of the irregular function  over the interval  The task here is to sum for divided into subintervals where  so that and  The function is shown in Figure 4 This function highly irregular so that the arc length calculation will sum many highly varying quantities If the limit on the summation were inìnity instead of 10 the resulting function while continuous and innocuous-looking is in fact non-rectiìableÑit does not have a nite arc length In any event it was chosen as a useful example for demonstrating round-off error when adding a large number of varying terms Finally to clearly show the effect of the limited mantissa bits we use the geometric series For performance results we conduct communication and summation evaluations To evaluate communication delay we conduct 50000 MPI reduction operations for each precision type in NERSCês Hopper which is a Cray XE6 cluster Because of the small payload of pack ets we conìgure the NICs to use the eager message path to the processor to a v oid the latenc y of block transfers V E VALUATION The precision loss in the rst experiment is illustrated in Figure 5 Since each summation produces an error and the small numbers   we add to the large number   are

Figure 5 Adding operands with a value of to a variable with the value of  BigInt equals the analytical result equal the error grows linearly with the number of operands Also the errors introduced by each variable type differ in orders of magnitude compared to BigInt because doubles long doubles and DDs have different levels of precision DD variables introduce approximately less error than doubles For better illustration Figure 6 left and center compares bits and decimal digits with the BigInt result As shown double and long double variables have a large error whereas the error for DDs is still noticeable Figure 6 right shows results for a summation where the large number   is large enough such that doubleand long double-precision variables drop the small numbers entirely For those cases summation is ineffective because the result equals the large number Compared to adding to a large number of  the precision for DDs is also lower To illustrate the precision loss in a realistic highly irregular mathematical computation we use the code on  described in Section IV In this experiment the numbers are close enough such that operands are not fully discarded The precision loss does not increase linearly with the number of operands because the function is highly variable Figure 7 illustrates the percentage error compared to BigInt and Figure 8 shows the bit and decimal digit comparisons As shown DDs still introduce noticeable error Even though for inìnite the geometric series converges to the number 2 for natural values of it should converge to less than 2 However due to the limited number of mantissa bits double variables report equal to 2 for and long doubles for  DDs are accurate until  Beyond that the second double-precision variable which denotes the error contained in the rst double-precision variable in DDs cannot accurately capture the accumulated error because the error exceeds its 53 available mantissa bits In contrast BigInts are accurate until  To evaluate the performance impact of BigInts in distributed summations we use MPI reductions and measure communication time using MPI constructs MPI reductions are typically used for summations performed on operands distributed across a large-scale system 34 In such operations communication progresses in a tree-like fashion where nodes in each level of the tree sum the operands they receive with their local operands and pass the partial sum a single number to the next level Figure 9 shows the time spent in communication BigInt increases communication time by approximately 35 compared to doubles but only 2%-14 compared to DDs Even though BigInts contain 2101 bits and therefore are 16 larger than 128-bit DDs for such small sizes communication is latency-bound instead of throughput-bound Therefore BigInt does not increase communication time signiìcantly because the additional bits lead to a minor increase since packet headers and xed zero-load delays in the network and NICs dominate for small transfers Our results are conìrmed by past work which sho wed that the communication delay for messages with payloads containing double-word quad-word and double quad-word variables is identical and approximately 12 s for up to 512 bytes which is a larger payload size than BigInts 256 bytes We then estimate computation time In modern Intel processors double-precision additions performed on dedicated FPUs require 5 cycles Ev en though the peak rate for FPUs is 2 ops/cycle summation throughput is limited by the FPU pipeline latency Increased-precision representations are considerably slower For example as discussed in Section II DD addition requires up to 20 operations Arbitraryprecision libraries use more complex representations and therefore are even slower BigInts can perform these operations at a rate that is comparable to DDs 20 cycles only with an 106-bit integer adder which can be easily integrated in modern NICs Computing in NICs a v oids potentially large context switching or wake up delays for local processors as well as data transfer latencies between the NIC and the processor that are typically signiìcantly longer than the few cycles to perform integer addition Context switching requires s while w aking up processors from deep sleep may require seconds 45 So the handful additional cycles required for extended precision and BigInts
