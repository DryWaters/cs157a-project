and amalgamating two previous works one is for mining closed itemsets from horizontally-partitioned databases and the other is for privacy preserving mining of itemsets from such databases We analyze the procedure on both of the viewpoint of communication cost and that of security We also show results of some experimental practice of applying the procedure to a well-known dataset Keywords frequent itemset mining closed itemsets privacy preserving data mining;horizontally-partitioned databases I I NTRODUCTION This paper presents a method which 002nds frequent closed 
itemsets from distributed transaction databases with preserving privacy Finding patterns occurring frequently in databases is a fundamental subject in the research of data mining When the databases are transaction databases and patterns are itemsets the problem is called frequent itemset mining and is the basis of association rule mining Privacy preserving mining from transaction databases has also been investigated Closed itemsets were originally from the research area of Formal Concept Analysis andwere introduced for developing ef\002cient mining algorithms It is sho wn that even if results of frequent itemset mining are restricted 
to closed itemsets all frequent itemsets can be recovered from the results This property suggests that using closed itemsets would contribute to decreasing the cost of communication among distributed databases with privacy preserving mining Our 002nal goal is to show that this suggestion can be true by developing a mining procedure This paper gives a basic idea and a basic mining procedure and analyzes the procedure on both of the viewpoint of communication cost and that of security We also show results of some experimental practice of applying the procedure to a wellknown dataset In the research of privacy preserving mining from trans 
action databases several models have been proposed for distributed transaction databases We adopt the horizontally partitioned database model In the model a global transaction database consists of several private databases each transaction in which is a subset of a same universal sets of items Every private database is managed by its own site Frequent itemset mining with preserving privacy in the model is to 002nd all itemsets which occur frequently in the global transaction database with less information is transformed between the sites We give a procedure named SFC-combine for discovering all of frequent closed itemsets with preserving privacy We 
002rst show that for a given horizontally partitioned database every frequent closed itemset in the global database must be a subset of a frequent closed itemset in at least one private database Then we design an algorithm named FCcombine for 002nding all frequent closed itemsets in the global database with less communication costs between distributed private database management systems The SFC-combine algorithm is implemented as the combination of FC-combine and an encryption method which has the commutative property In our implementation of experimental practice we adopt the Pohlig-Hellman method The paper is organized as follows In the following section 
we survey some fundamental concepts and terminology in frequent itemset mining and de\002ne the problem we are solving In Section III we give the procedures FCcombine and SFC-combine In Section IV we report some experimental results with comparing the method proposed in some previous work and a na 250 021ve method based on multiparty protocol We also give theoretical analysis of the communication cost and security We concludes the paper in Section V

I I P RELIMINARIES A Frequent itemset mining and closed itemsets Let I  f i 1  i 2      i m g be a set of items  A subset of I is called an itemset  Following the custom of the research area an itemset f i 1  i 2      i k g is denoted by i 1 i 2 001 001 001 i k  A transaction is a pair  tid X  where tid is a natural number for its index and X is an itemset For a transaction t   tid X   we write id  t   tid and itemset  t   X  A transaction database DB is a 002nite set of transactions such that id  t  6  id  s  for any two distinct transactions t and s in DB  Roughly speaking frequent itemset mining means that 002nding itemsets which frequently occurs in a given transaction database If X 022 itemset  t  for a transaction t  we say that X occurs in t and write X 022 t  The support of an itemset X in DB is de\002ned as X:sup DB   f t j X 022 t g   D B   where   S  denotes the cardinality of a set S  The suf\002x is omitted if it is clear from context Given a real number 033 0 024 033 024 1 as a threshold an itemset X is 033 frequent  or frequent if X:sup DB 025 033  and frequent itemset mining is de\002ned as 002nding all 033 frequent itemsets It is known that the number of frequent itemsets is of exponential order of  I  and that it is dif 002cult to 002nd important itemsets if we enumerate all frequent ones Closed itemsets are introduced for reduce the numbers of outputs in solving the frequent itemset mining problem Let us de\002ne functions f  2 DB  2 I  g  2 I  2 DB  and cl  2 I  2 I as follows f  T   f i 2 I j 8 t 2 T i 2 t g for T 022 DB g  X   f t 2 DB j 8 i 2 X i 2 t g for X 022 I  cl  f 016 g The function cl is called a Galois closure operator because we could regard the pair of f and g as a Galois connection in mathematics An itemset X is closed if cl  X   X  The frequent closed itemset mining problem is de\002ned as 002nding all 033 frequent closed itemsets Example 1 Let DB be the transaction database illustrated in Figure 1 Then it holds that f  f 2  bce   3  abce   5  abce  g   bce g  ce   f 2  bce   3  abce   5  abce  g  f  g  ce   bce For an itemset ac  we have cl  ac   f  g  ac   f  f 1  acd   3  abce   5  abce  g   ac DB I D Items 1 a c d 2 b c e 3 a b c e 4 b e 5 a b c e I  f a b c d e g Figure 1 An Example of a Transaction Database DB 1 I D Items 1  1 a b 2  2 a b 3  3 a c D B 2 I D Items 2  1 a 2  2 a 2  3 b c D B 3 I D Items 3  1 a b c 3  2 a b c 3  3 a b c Figure 2 An Example of a Distributed Database and therefore ac is a closed itemset The singleton itemset a is not closed because cl  a   f  g  a   f  f 1  acd   3  abce   5  abce  g   ac When we let the threshold 033  0  5  the set of all frequent closed itemsets in DB is FC  f c ac be bce g while the set of all frequent itemsets is FC  f a b bc ce e g  It was shown in that all frequent 033 itemsets can be ef\002ciently generated from the set of 033 frequent closed itemsets B Itemset Mining in Distributed Databases We adopt horizontally-partitioned transaction databases as the model of distributed databases in the theory below An example of such databases is illustrated in Figure 2 We give a formal de\002nition of distributed databases A distributed transaction database DB is a set of transaction databases DB 1  DB 2      DB N  N 025 2 which satisfy that 8 i j 1 024 i  j 024 N  8 t 2 DB i 8 s 2 DB j id  t  6  id  s   1 Each database DB i is called a private database  We assume that each private database DB i is managed by its own DBMS called Site S i  We sometimes call DB a global database  Let K  f a 1  a 2      a i g 022 f 1  2      N g be a set of indices From the restriction 1 the union DB K  DB a 1  DB a 2      DB a i

VII S UMMARY We have shown how robustness under subsampling for common classes of itemsets can be computed efciently without actually sampling the data The experimental results show that the number of reported itemsets can be largely reduced on many datasets in other words spurious itemsets that would not have been found in many subsets of the data are removed The approach can further be used to rank itemsets for topk mining by robustness Future work will investigate the effect of using robust itemsets on data mining tasks such as clustering classication and rule generation using itemsets A CKNOWLEDGMENTS Nikolaj Tatti is supported by Post-Doctoral Fellowships of the Research FoundationFlanders  FWO  R EFERENCES  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A N Sw ami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases in SIGMOD  1993 pp 207216  J Hipp U Güntzer  and G Nakhaeizadeh  Algorithms for association rule mining a general survey and comparison SIGKDD Explorations  vol 2 no 1 pp 5864 2000  K W ang C Xu and B Liu Clustering transactions using large items in CIKM  1999 pp 483490  H Cheng X Y an J Han and C Hsu Discriminati v e frequent pattern analysis for effective classication in ICDE  2007 pp 716725  F  Moerchen M Thies and A Ultsch Ef cient mining of all margin-closed itemsets with applications in temporal knowledge discovery and classication by compression KAIS  2010  K Smets and J Vreek en The odd one out Identifying and characterising anomalies in SDM  2011  N P asquier  Y  Bastide R T aouil and L Lakhal Disco v er ing frequent closed itemsets for association rules in ICDT  1999 pp 398416  J Pei J Han and L V  S Lakshmanan Mining frequent itemsets with convertible constraints in ICDE  2001 pp 433442  T  Calders C Rigotti and J.-F  Boulicaut  A surv e y on condensed representations for frequent sets in ConstraintBased Mining and Inductive Databases  2006 pp 6480  S Brin R Motw ani and C Silv erstein Be yond mark et baskets Generalizing association rules to correlations in SIGMOD  1997 pp 265276  N T atti Maximum entrop y based signicance of itemsets  KAIS  vol 17 no 1 pp 5777 2008  F  Geerts B Goethals and T  Mielikäinen T iling databases  in Proc Discovery Science  2004 pp 278289  J.-F  Boulicaut A Byk o wski and C Rigotti Free-sets A condensed representation of boolean data for the approximation of frequency queries DMKD  vol 7 no 1 pp 522 2003  T  Calders and B Goethals Non-deri v a ble itemset mining  DMKD  vol 14 no 1 pp 171206 2007  T  Mielikäinen T ransaction databases frequent itemsets and their condensed representations in KDID  2005 pp 139 164  D Xin J Han X Y an and H Cheng Mining compressed frequent-pattern sets in VLDB  2005 pp 709720  A Gallo T  De Bie and N Cristianini Mini Mining informative non-redundant itemsets in ECMLPKDD  2007 pp 438445  G I W ebb Disco v ering signicant patterns  Mach Learn  vol 68 no 1 pp 133 2007  R Gupta G F ang B Field M Steinbach and V  K umar  Quantitative evaluation of approximate frequent pattern mining algorithms in KDD  2008 pp 301309  T  Calders B Goethals and M Mampae y  Mining itemsets in the presence of missing values in SAC  2007 pp 404 408  T  Uno and H Arimura  An ef cient polynomial delay algorithm for pseudo frequent itemset mining in Discovery Science  Springer 2007 pp 219230  C Luccese S Orlando and G Pere go R.Casas-Garriga Mining top-k patterns from binary datasets in presence of noise in ICDM  2010  H Cheng P  S Y u and J Han A C-Close Ef ciently mining approximate closed itemsets by core pattern recovery in ICDM  IEEE 2006 pp 839844  J.-F  Boulicaut A Byk o wski and C Rigotti  Approximation of frequency queries by means of free-sets in PKDD  2000 pp 7585  B Goethals and M Zaki FIMI 03 frequent itemset mining implementations in ICDM 2003 Workshop FIMI  2003  A Asuncion and D Ne wman UCI machine learning repository 2007 A v ailable http://www ics.uci edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html  F  Coenen The LUCS-KDD discretised/normalised ARM and CARM data library 2003 A v ailable http www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frans/KDD/Software/LUCS_KDD_DN  Y  Zhao and G Karypis Ev aluation of hierarchical clustering algorithms for document datasets in CIKM  2002 pp 515 524  B Bringmann and A Zimmermann One in a million picking the right patterns KAIS  vol 18 no 1 pp 6181 2009  J Vreek en M v an Leeuwen and A Siebes Krimp mining itemsets that compress DMKD  vol 23 no 1 pp 169214 2011

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
