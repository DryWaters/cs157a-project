space missions presents a challenge to the scientist determine to extract useful scienti\002c information from this data Automated methods to facilitate this process are clearly needed to complete these investigations in a timely manner Organizing this data into meaningful chunks is a crucial 002rst step of this analysis that can be be addressed with clustering techniques We have developed an automated clustering and classi\002cation scheme based on Kohonen Self-Organizing maps  SOM  The SOM is a type of unsupervised neural network widely used to cluster data and identify anomalies A modi\002cation of the Davies-Bouldin  DB  cluster validation index which incorporates the measurement uncertainties of the 
SOM training data is used to determine the optimal number of clusters This scheme was trained and tested with the mineral spectral libraries prepared at Arizona State University ASU and John Hopkins University JHU whose samples have been hierarchically labeled with Class Subclass and Group names These names are used to measure the spectral purity of the derived clusters and the accuracy of classi\002cation We describe in detail the SOM scheme itself the performance measures and testing procedure The test results demonstrate that the SOM can be a useful component in autonomous systems designed to identify minerals from re\003ectance or emissivity measurements in the thermal infrared T

An automated classi\002cation scheme that is robust and scienti\002cally meaningful can greatly facilitate the interpretative efforts Such a scheme is also an essential component of intelligent remote sensing systems that will operate on or near distant planets moons or asteroids 4 It is ultimately intended that such systems will operate for weeks at a time without human intervention Therefore such systems must be autonomously capable of responding to the scienti\002c content of sensor data within a science-driven mission scenario In this paper we describe an automated unsupervised classi\002cation scheme based on Kohonen self-organizing maps  SOM  The SOM has been used in many industrial applications to automate processes crucial for production and ef\002 
ciency 6 7 8 Classi\002cations using the SOM have been applied to Auger spectra Raman spectra 10 IR re\003ectance spectra RGB color images 11 and mineral spectra in the near and far-infrared 13 2 A PPROACH A cluster of N dimensional vectors can be loosely de\002ned as a set of vectors in the space V N which are both close in proximity and strongly correlated A K clustering is one in1 
 


stance of a set of K clusters in V N  The K means  KM  is a popular algorithm for 002nding such clusters in large data sets It requires an initial set of vectors which during the clustering are updated to vectors representing the cluster centers In general the number of clusters is not known The number of initial vectors is incrementally adjusted requiring a new round of training and criteria for evaluating the quality of the clustering are applied The training/evaluation process continues until an optimum clustering is found This incremental KM approach to 002nding the number of clusters has been applied to spectral measurements of the Martian surface In this study 002nding the optimum clustering was never really fully addressed because of the impracticability of exploring all potential cluster numbers in such a huge dataset SOM training Another type of clustering algorithm is based on neural networks designed to self-organize their output layer into neighborhoods which can be associated with clusters in the input space The SOM algorithm used in this study was introduced by Kohonen and implemented as a C code by 16 The SOM has an input layer and output layer The input is a linear array of nodes one for each component of the N dimensional input vector The SOM output layer consists of nodes or cells usually arranged in a 1-D or 2-D uniform array Initially each cell is assigned a vector from V N in a random fashion An input vector is presented to the network and the cell vector closest in the Euclidean sense to the input vector is activated We will call this proximity activation Correlation activation another type of activation used in this study selects the cell whose vector is most correlated with the input vector The correlation measure is the linear Pearson correlation coef\002cient The SOM clustering is done in two phases training and partitioning During the training phase the set of input vectors training vectors is presented to the network many times cycles Each time vectors associated with the activated nodes and their neighbors are modi\002ed as follows V new i  V old i  003 ij  V T 000 V old i  1 where V i is a vector associated with node i  V T is a training vector and 003 ij is 003 ij  013 exp 000 d 2 ij 2 033 2  2 where d ij is the distance between the node i and activated node j  013 and 033 are terms that control the strength and radius of modi\002cation They are reduced in a linear fashion after each cycle until the node vectors equilibrate SOM partitioning After the training phase is complete the output layer neighborhoods can be visualized by 1 indicating which output nodes are activated by the training set and 2 indicating the proximity of vectors associated with adjacent nodes The latter is typically accomplished by drawing walls between the nodes whose thickness grey scale or color correlate with the proximity see Meaningful training v ector labels can also be added to facilitate the interpretation of the neighborhoods The partitioning phase divides the output layer into disjoint regions A region is de\002ned as a set of nodes surrounded by walls higher than some speci\002ed value called barriers such that at least one node is activated by a training vector An algorithm for locating regions is described as follows 017 1 Find a activated node and mark it 017 2 Move north until a barrier is reached marking each node traversed 017 3 Repeat 2 for all other directions 017 4 Starting from a marked cell move north until either a marked node or barrier is encountered 017 5 Repeat 4 for all other directions 017 6 Repeat 4 and 5 until it's impossible to move in any direction The set of marked nodes de\002nes a region Steps 1 6 are repeated starting from all unmarked activated nodes until all activated nodes have been marked This completes the partitioning of the SOM output layer into disjoint regions The number of regions increases as the barrier height is decreased from the maximum to the minimum wall height The training vectors associated with a region's activated nodes represent a cluster in V N  SOM Partition Optimization The optimum partition of the SOM output layer is that partition which optimizes an index characterizing the quality of clustering  One such index known as the Davies-Bouldin  DB  index measures the de gree of cluster o v erlap F or given cluster i its center is de\002ned as the vector average of the cluster's vectors The separation S ij between two clusters i and j is then the distance between their centers The cluster radius R i is de\002ned as the average of the distances between the cluster's vectors and its center The DB is then de\002ned as follows 1 K K X i 1 m ax i 6  j 022 R i  R j S ij 023 3 The DB is typically used to determine the optimal number of clusters in the training set by 002nding the K clustering that minimizes its value Determining the location of the global minimum is problematic for two reasons First the DB must 2 
 


Figure 1  DB and DBE curv es derived from the clustering of the ASU Sub-class training set eventually decrease to zero as K approaches the size of the training set This is because single member clusters which dominate the clustering have zero radii and therefore contribute nothing to the numerator in equation 3 Additionally the DB has no penalty for clusters whose radii are large on a scale related to the inherent uncertainties of the spectral data Instead the radius size scale varies for different K clusterings This can produce a DB whose global minimum corresponds to a clustering of one or more large clusters In an attempt to address these issues we extended the de\002nition of the DB to give single member clusters a 002nite minimum radius and penalize clusters larger than this minimum The extended de\002nition DBE is 1 K K X i 1 m ax i 6  j 1 2 022 R i  R j S ij  R i  R j 2 R min 023 4 where R i  max  R i  R min  and R min is a minimum cluster radius In practice R min can be derived from the measurement uncertainties or systematic variations  e.g viewing geometry or grain size effects The determination of the R min for the libraries used in this study will be addressed in Section 3 In Figure 1 we compare the DB and DBE derived from the ASU Sub-class training set The DB curve has no clearly de\002ned global minimum before the maximum cluster number is reached whereas the DBE indicates a nontrivial clearly de\002ne minimum located at cluster number 45 The upward Table 1  Minimum Cluster Radius Library Minimum Radius JHU 002ne 2.992283 JHU coarse 19.116851 JHU solid 84.434455 ASU 0.371439 trends to the left and right of this minimum are due respecti vely to the introduction of the cluster size penalty and a 002nite R min  In this study the number of clusters was determined by 002nding the global minimum of DBE as function of cluster number 3 D ATA U SED IN THE A NALYSIS We have selected the Arizona State University ASU circa 2003 and the John Hopkins University JHU mineral spectral libraries for evaluating the SOM  These database are generally documented and contain numerous mineral samples with a wide range of grain sizes The ASU are primarily coarse grained 710 1000 026 m and measured in the spectral range 5-50 026 m as emissivity The JHU was divided into three libraries containing samples described in the database as as 002ne grained   74 026 m coarse grained 75200 026 m and solid The spectral range of these re\003ectance measurements was limited to 2.08 25 026 m The library samples are labeled using names that were partly taken from the database assignments to the Class and Subclass keywords The labels were broken down into three types Class Sub-class and Group The label names are more descriptive of the sample's chemical and structural variations as one moves from the Class to Group label types The distribution of label names for the ASU and JHU libraries are shown in Figures 2 and 3 The minimum radii needed for the DBE calculation was determined as follows For a given Group name the two closest spectra labeled with that name are found and the radius for this cluster of two samples is computed R min is the average of the computed radii associated with the unique Group names The R min calculated for each library are indicated in Table 1 The magnitude difference between the ASU and JHU R min values is due to the absolute units of the spectral measurements emissivity vs percent re\003ectance and the number of spectral channels 923 vs 828 4 E VALUATION C RITERION AND R ESULTS The performance of the SOM clustering/classi\002cation scheme was evaluated with two measures to assess the mineralogical meaning of the clusters and the accuracy of classifying spectra not used for training The sample labels described in Section 3 provide a means to determine both the mineralogical makeup of the clusters and the classi\002cation accuracy The library spectra are divided into two disjoint sets for 3

  11  Figure 16 \226 The loss of spat ial resolution for errors in p    The spatial distribution of th e reconstructed images is illustrated in Figure 17 for p 0.5\260 and 400nm, 425nm and 450nm As expected, the larger dispersion at the shorter wavelengths will cause a larger shif t error.  In fact, as shown in Fig. 17 the error radius can become so large that we again see donuts as point response functions in the reconstruction Final Comments Specific systematic sources of error have been presented in this section independently Obviously it is a combination these errors that will propaga te through the transform to give the final result in terms of resolution and displacement in the reconstructed hyperspectral data set.  The contribution of each systematic error source in terms of the derived r   p  or  x\222 y\222 representation can be used to create an error kernel for each given in Equations 10 and 11 multiplied in series in Fourier space or convolved in series in the spatial domain to evaluate the cumulative effect  3  C OMPARISON TO M EASUREMENTS  The effect and sensitivity of th e selected systematic errors have been shown given the mathematical models for projection and reconstruction.  Data taken from the AFIT CTI instrument will be examined to determine how well the model is capturing the modeled impact of the systematic error with controlled in strumental inaccuracies Data Collection and Analysis An effective point source will be the target for the system and is represented by a 300 m pinhole at the object plane illuminated by a combination of an Hg pen lamp and red laser pointer.  This provid es 5 clear lines at 404.7nm 435.8nm, 546nm, 577.5nm, and 635nm 5 with the first four being from the pen lamp.   Care is taken here to not suggest that this is a true validation of the model, as it is impossible to completely isolate the effect of a single source of error Furthermore, the instrument was not designed with the exact measurement of quan tities such as detector tilt or prism alignment in mind, so these qu antities have to be measured indirectly. An attempt is made to make the particular error in question gross enough to be the overwhelming contributor and variation du e to possible inaccuracy in measurement is included in the model For each instance of induced systematic error in the instrument, projections will be taken at p 0\260-345 1 5 260 increments to provide a total of 23 projections.  This data will not be reconstructed usin g the SAA algorithm as that will serve to compound the contribution of unaccounted error.  Instead, a direct comparison to the derived r   p  will be made in each case.  In assessing the model vs performance, trends in this da ta will be consid ered in favor of absolute difference.  The measurements made address effect of detector tilt and di stance error, accuracy of the dependence of p   on I and error from prism misalignment.  For the this co llected data, a correction will be made to better calibrate the system to the actual p   to avoid the spectral shift in the data Variation in Detector Array Tilt and Distance To measure the affect that til t has on the collected data, the PIMAX camera was slightly ro tated from its position to create an angle between the detector array and the normal to the optical axis as shown in Figure 6.  Because the camera was rotated about its mount point, which is displaced from detector by 70 mm, the rotation angle also  5 The 577.5 line is the average of the Hg doublet that appears here and not clearly resolved by the instrument nm Spatial Res. \(pixels 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 p = 0.10\260 p = 0.25\260 p = 0.50\260  Figure 17 \226 The 400 nm, 425 nm, and 450 nm spatial functions for p 0.5\260.

Swiveling the camera also rotates the array away from th e image plane, so there is a hard limit on the  that can be imparted before the spectrum is off of the array  The camera is turned 4\260 in the +x-direction x 4\260\nd tilted upward y 2\260\.  The camera was moved toward L 3  by 2mm d 2mm corporating the variable distance imparted by the camera sw ivel.  It is estimated that the tilt angle of the camera can be measured to +/- 0.25\260 and that the error in from both components\within 0.5mm.  These measurement er ror estimations will be used in the model to determine a maximum and minimum range of model results.  Equation 13 will be used to calculate r   p  the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle.  For the 404.7nm source, the image was projected off of the array at p 140\260 - 200\260 thus the gap in data.  The results are shown in Figs. 18-22   Figure 18 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 404.7nm spectral line   Figure 19\226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 435.8nm spectral line   Figure 20 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 546nm spectral line   Figure 21 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 577.5nm spectral line   Figure 22 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 635nm spectral line   The data imply that the overall mean value of r   p  is being captured which represents the contribution of The shapes of the curves appear to match somewhat for the 404nm and 435nm cases, but the correlation for the other three wavelengths is not as cl ose.  For these wavelengths the variation in r   p  as a function of p is very small possibly due to other uncontrolled error.  Also, for these and all spatial location measurements, there is inherent quantization error in determinin g the center of the Gaussian fit function due to the phasing of the samples on the array 6  Change in p  as a Function of I  A major impact on the reconstr uction algorithm is the error in estimation of the prism dispersion angle p   due to the difference in assumed and true values of the incident angle to the prism I This drives the observed error as a result of prism misalignment, as well as the correction needed in the reconstruction to account for fiel d angle.

The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.  For example, errors in distance to the focal plane or tilt also result in a defocus error which cannot be easily recovered in the reconstruction algorithm R EFERENCES  1  C G r o s s, G  P.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies.

movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
