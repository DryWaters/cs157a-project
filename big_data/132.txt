Mining Association Rules in OLAP Cubes Riadh Ben Messaoud   Omar Boussaid   and Sabine Loudcher Rabas  eda  Laboratory ERIC  University of Lyon 2 5 avenue Pierre Mend  es-France 69676 Bron Cedex France  rbenmessaoud@eric.univ-lyon2.fr   boussaid  sabine.loudcher  univ-lyon2.fr Abstract On-line analytical processing OLAP provides tools to 
explore data cubes in order to extract interesting information Nevertheless OLAP is not capable of explaining relationships that could exist within data Association rules are one kind of data mining techniques which nds associations among data In this paper we propose a framework for mining association rules from data cubes according to a sum-based aggregate measure which is more general than frequencies provided by the COUNT measure Our mining process is guided by a meta-rule context driven by analysis objectives and exploits aggregate measures to revisit the 
deﬁnition of support and conﬁdence We also evaluate the interestingness of mined association rules according to Lift and Loevinger criteria and propose an algorithm for mining inter-dimensional association rules directly from a multidimensional structure of data 1 Introduction Data warehousing and OLAP technology has known important progress since the 90s In addition with efcient techniques developed for computing data cubes OLAP users have become widely able to explore multidimensional data navigate through hierarchical levels of dimensions and therefore extract interesting information according to multiple levels of granularity Nevertheless the OLAP tech 
nology is quite limited to an exploratory task and does not provide automatic tools to explain relationships and associations within data Users are usually supposed to explore the data cube according to multiple dimensions in order to manually nd an explanation for a given phenomenon In the recent years many studies addressed the issue of performing data mining tasks on data warehouses Some of them were specically interested to mining patterns and association rules in data cubes For instance Imieli  nski et al state that OLAP is closely intertwined with association rules and shares the goal with association rules for nding pat 
terns in the data  Data mining techniques such as association rule mining can be used together with OLAP to discover knowledge from data cubes The aggregate values needed for discovering association rules are already precomputed and stored in the data cube The COUNT cells of a cube store the number of occurrences of the corresponding multidimensional data values With such summary cells it is straightforward to calculate the values of the support and the condence of association rules The COUNT measure corresponds to the frequency of facts Nevertheless in an analysis process users are usually 
interested in observing multidimensional data and their associations according to measures more relevant than simple frequencies In this paper we establish a general framework for mining inter-dimensional association rules from multidimensional data We use the concept of inter-dimensional meta-rule which allows users to guide the mining process and focus on a specic context from which rules can be extracted Our framework also allows a redenition of the support and condence measures based on the SUM aggregate functions over cube indicators measures Therefore the computation of support and condence according to the 
COUNT measure becomes a particular case in our proposal In addition to support and condence we use two other descriptive criteria  Lift and Loevinger  in order to evaluate interestingness of mined associations These criteria reect interestingness of associations in a more relevant way than what is offered by support and condence We developed an efcient bottom-up algorithm which adapts the traditional Apriori algorithm in order to handle multidimensional data This paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we expose a state of the art about association rule mining 
from multidimensional data In Section 3 we dene the concept of inter-dimensional meta-rule  present the general computation of support and condence based on measures and provide advanced evaluation of mined association rules Section 4 describes our algorithm of mining inter-dimensional association rules and shows its efciency with experiments Finally in Section 5 we conclude and propose some future research directions 


2 Related work To the best of our knowledge Kamber et al  w ere t he rst who addressed the issue of mining association rules from multidimensional data  They introduced the metaruleguided mining which uses rule templates dened by users in order to guide the mining process of inter-dimensional association rules Zhu divides the problem of mining association rules from data cubes to inter-dimensional  intradimensional  and hybrid association mining  In 3 Chen et al mine intra-dimensional association rules by adding features from other dimensions at multiple levels Extended association rules  consist o f r epetiti v e predicates by involving attributes from user dened non-item dimensions Tjioe and Taniar e xtract associations from multiple dimensions by focusing on summarized data They prepare multidimensional data for the mining process by pruning rows in the fact table which have less than the average quantity All the proposed approaches are restricted to the COUNT measure in the mining process of associations In this paper we use the notion of metarule-guided mining proposed by Kamber et al  t o guide a general process o f mining inter-dimensional associations with non-repetitive predicates The main contribution of our proposal consists in integrating the measures of a data cube in the computation of the support and the condence of association rules We also use advanced criteria in order to evaluate interestingness of mined associations An Apriori based algorithm is also adapted in order to handle multidimensional data 3 The proposed framework 3.1 Notations and terminologies Let C be a data cube with a non empty set of d dimensions D   D i  1  i  d  and a non empty set of measures M  Each dimension D i D encloses a non empty set of hierarchical levels We assume that H i j is the j th  j  0  hierarchical level in D i  The coarse level of D i  denoted H i 0  corresponds to its total aggregation level All Let H i be the set of hierarchical levels of dimension D i where each hierarchical level H i j H i consists of a non empty set of members denoted A ij  Let D  D be a non empty set of p dimensions  D 1 D p  from the data cube C  p  d  The p tuple  1   p  denes a sub-cube on C according to D  iff  i  1 p    i    and there exists a unique j such that  i A ij  A sub-cube according to a set of dimensions D  corresponds to a portion from the initial data cube C  It consists in setting for each dimension from D  a non empty subset of member values from a single hierarchical level of that dimension Each cell from the data cube C represents an OLAP fact which is evaluated in R according to one measure M from M  We evaluate a sub-cube according to its sum-based aggregate measure  The sum-based aggregate measure of a sub-cube  1   p  on C according to M M  noted M  1   p  isthe SUM of measure M of all facts in the sub-cube We dene a dimension predicate  i in a D i as the predicate  a A ij  which takes a dimension member as a value Let D  D be a non empty set of p dimensions  D 1 D p  from the data cube C  2  p  d  We also dene   1 012∑∑∑\012  p  as an inter-dimensional predicate in D  iff  i  1 p    i is a dimension predicate in D i  3.2 Inter-dimensional meta-rules We consider two distinct subsets of dimensions in the data cube C 1 D C D is a subset of p context dimensions  and 2 D A is a subset of  s  r  analysis dimensions  An inter-dimensional meta-rule is of the following form  In the context  1   p    1 012∑∑∑\012  s     1 012∑∑∑\012  r  1  1   p  is a sub-cube on C according to D C It denes the portion of cube C to be mined Unlike  our meta-rule allows the user to target a mining context by identifying a particular sub-cube to be explored We note that  k  1 s  respectively  k  1 r    k respectively  k  is a dimension predicate in a distinct dimension from D A  Therefore   1 012∑∑∑\012  s  012   1 012∑∑∑\012  r  is an inter-dimensional predicates in D A  3.3 Measure-based support and conﬁdence Traditionally the support S UPP  of an association rule X  Y  in a database of transactions T  is the probability that the population of transactions contains both X and Y  The condence  C ONF f X  Y is the conditional probability that a transaction contains Y given that it already contains X  In the case of a data cube C  the aggregate values needed for discovering association rules are already computed and stored in C  In fact a data cube stores the particular COUNT measure which represents precomputed frequencies of OLAP facts Nevertheless with the COUNT measure only number of occurrences of facts are taken into account to decide whether a rule is large respectively strong  or not However in the OLAP context users are usually interested to observe facts according to summarized values of measures more expressive than their simple number of occurrences It is naturally signicant to observe association rules according to the sum of these measures Let us consider a data cube of Sales by taking once the COUNT measure Table 1\(a and then the total proﬁt measure Table 1\(b In this example with a minsupp 0  2  the itemsets   America    MP3    2004   and   America    MP3    2005   are large according to the COUNT

criterion represents the probability scale coefcient of having Y when X occurs By opposition to the condence which considers directional implication the Lift directly captures correlation between body X and its head Y In general greater Lift values indicate stronger associations The Loevinger criterion is one of the oldest used interestingness evaluation for association rules It consists in a linear transformation of the condence achieved by centering it on P Y and dividing it by the scale coefcient P  Y  In other terms the Loevinger criterion normalizes the centered condence of a rule according to the probability of not satisfying its head 4 Implementation algorithm and experiments We developed a Web application to mine association rules from data cubes according to our proposal This application is a module evolving in a general Client/Server platform called MiningCubes  The p latform enables connection to multidimensional data cubes stored in the Analysis Services of MS SQL Server 2000 A Mining Association Rule Module allows the denition of analysis dimensions D A  context dimensions D C  a meta-rule with its context sub-cube  1   p  and its inter-dimensional predicates scheme   1 012  012  s     1 012  012  r   the measure M used to compute criteria of association rules the minimum support threshold minsupp  and the minimum condence threshold minconf  Traditionally frequent itemsets can be mined according to a top-down search or a bottom-up search The bottomup approach complies with the antimonotony property of the Apriori algorithm  which s tates t hat for each non frequent itemset all its super-itemsets are deﬁnitely not frequent  This property enables the reduction of the search space especially when it deals with large and sparse data sets which is particulary the case of OLAP data cubes As summarized in Algorithm 1 we proceed by an bottom-up level wise search for large i itemsets where level i is the number of items in the set We denote by C  i  the sets of i candidates  i.e i itemsets that are potentially frequent and F  i  the sets of i frequents  i.e frequent i itemsets At the initialization step  our algorithm captures the 1candidates from user dened analysis dimensions D A over the data cube C  These 1-candidates correspond to members of D A  where each member complies with one dimension predicate  k or  k in the meta-rule R  For each level i iftheset C  i  is not empty and i is less than  s  r   the rst step of our algorithm derives frequent itemsets F  i  from C  i  according to i an itemset A  C  i  should be an instance of an inter-dimensional predicates in D A  and ii an itemset A  C  i  must have a support greater than minsupp  input  C  D C  D A  D U  R M minsupp minconf output  X  Y S UPP  C ONF  L IFT  L OEV C 1   for i  1 to  s  r  do C 1  C 1 A ij  end i  1  while C  i     and i   s  r  do F  i    foreach A  C  i  do if A is an inter-dimensional predicates then S UPP  C OMPUTE S UPPORT  A M   if S UPP  minsupp then F  i   F  i   A   end end foreach A  F  i  do foreach non empty B  A do if A  B  B complies with R then C ONF  C OMPUTE C ONFIDENCE  A  B B M   if C ONF  minconf then X  A  B  Y  B  L IFT  C OMPUTE L IFT  X Y M   L OEV  C OMPUTE L OEVINGER  X Y M   return  X  Y S UPP  C ONF  L IFT  L OEV   end end end end C  i 1   foreach A  F  i  do foreach B  F  i  that shares i  1 items with A do if All Z 012 A  B  of i items are inter-dimensional predicates and frequent then C  i 1  C  i 1  A  B   end end end i  i 1  end Algorithm 1  Algorithm for mining association rules in a data cube From each A  F  i   the second step extracts association rules with respect to i an association rule X  Y must comply with the user dened meta-rule R  and ii an association rule must have a condence greater than minconf  The computation of condence is also based on the user dened measure M according to formulas 2 and 3 When an association rule satises the two previous conditions the algorithm computes its Lift and Loevinger criteria according to formulas 4 and 5 The computation of support condence Lift and Loevinger criteria are performed respectively by functions C OMPUTE S UP PORT C OMPUTE C ONFIDENCE C OMPUTE L IFT and C OM PUTE L OEVINGER which directly pick up required precomputed aggregates from the data cube via MDX MultiDimensional eXpression queries Based on the Apriori property the third step uses the set F  i  of large i itemsets to derive a new set C  i 1 of  i 1 candidates One  i 1 candidate is the union of two i itemsets A and B from F  i  that respects three conditions i A and B must have i  1 commun items ii all non empty sub-itemsets from A 015 B must be instances of inter 


dimensional predicates in D A  and iii all non empty subitemsets from A 015 B must be frequent itemsets According to the experiments 1 presented in Figure 1 for a support and a condence thresholds equal to 5  we notice that the efciency of the algorithm closely depends on the number of extracted frequent itemsets and association rules The generation of association rules from frequent itemsets is more time consuming than the extraction of frequent itemsets themselves In fact an Apriori based algorithm is efcient for searching frequent itemsets and have a low complexity level especially in the case of sparse data Nevertheless the Apriori property does not reduce the running time of extracting association rules from a frequent itemset  0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 of association rules 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160   of frequent itemsets Rutime in seconds minsup = 5 minconf = 5 Frequent itemsets Association rules   Figure 1 The running times of our algorithm according to  of frequent itemsets and  of association rules 5 Conclusion and perspectives In this paper we establish a general framework for mining inter-dimensional association rules from data cubes We use inter-dimensional meta-rule which allows users to target the mining process in a particular portion in the mined data cube We provide a general computation of support and condence of association rules that can be based on any measure from the data cube This issue is quite interesting since it expresses associations which consider wide analysis objectives and do not restrict users analysis to associations only driven by the traditional COUNT measure We also propose to evaluate interestingness of mined rules with two additional descriptive criteria in order to express the relevance of rules in a more precise way than what is offered by the support and the condence We developed an efcient 1 The experiments are conducted under Windows XP on a 1.60GHz PC with 480MB of main memory bottom-up algorithm which adapts the traditional Apriori algorithm in order to handle the multidimensional structure of data Some future directions need to be addressed for this work We plan to embed the measure in the expression of mined inter-dimensional association rules In addition we need to prot from the hierarchical aspect of cube dimensions to mine association rules at different level of granularities Finally we also have to cope with the visualization of mined association rules in the space representation of the data cube itself in order to make associations easier to interpret and to exploit References  R  A gra w al T  I mielinski and A  S w a mi M ining A ssociation Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data SIGMOD 1993  pages 207ñ216 Washington D.C USA May 1993 ACM Press  S  B rin R Motw ani and C  S ilv erstein Be yond Mark et Baskets Generalizing Association Rules to Correlations In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data SIGMOD 1997  pages 265ñ276 Tucson Arizona USA May 1997 ACM Press  Q  C hen U Dayal a nd M Hsu An OLAP-based Scalable Web Access Analysis Engine In Proceedings of the 2 nd International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery DaWaK 2000  Lecture Notes in Computer Science pages 210ñ223 London UK September 2000 Springer-Verlag  T  I mieli  nski L Khachiyan and A Abdulghani Cubegrades Generalizing Association Rules Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery  6\(3 2002  M  Kamber  J Han a nd J Chiang Metarule-Guided M ining of Multi-Dimensional Association Rules Using Data Cubes In Proceedings of the 3 rd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining KDD 1997  pages 207ñ210 Newport Beach CA USA August 1997 The AAAI Press  J  L oe vinger  A S ystemic A pproach to the C onstruction a nd Evaluation of Tests of Ability Psychological Monographs  61\(4 1947  R  B  M essaoud O Boussaid a nd S L Rabas  eda A Data Mining-Based OLAP Aggregation of Complex Data Application on XML Documents International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining  2\(4 2006  S  Nestoro v a nd N Juki  c Ad-Hoc Association-Rule Mining within the Data Warehouse In Proceedings of the 36 th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences HICSS 2003  pages 232ñ242 Big Island Hawaii USA January 2003 IEEE Computer Society  H  C  T jioe a nd D T a niar  M ining A ssociation R ules in Data Warehouses International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining  1\(3 2005  H Zhu On-Line Analytical Mining of Association R ules Masterís thesis Simon Fraser University Burnaby British Columbia Canada December 1998

Structural Model  After the measurement model specification, we analyze the structural model. The squared multiple correlations \(R 2 xpress the significance of the four endogenous variables. The corresponding t-values show the level of significance using the magnitude of the standardized parameter estimates between constructs. The path coefficients in the research model are significant as shown in Figure 2  The explanatory power of the R≤ is classified by Chin bs t a n t i a l e x pres s i v en e s s f o r t h e  research model could be estimated by an R≤ over 0.67. An average effect stands for R≤-values between 0.67 and 0.34. The explanatory power is weak for an R≤ between 0.34 and 0.19 and overall not relevant for R≤-values under 0.19 [1    Figure 2: Structural model validation   Therefore R≤ of our research model for the intention to use self- and e-assessment can be categorized as substantial expressive for perceived usefulness and as an average effect for intention  4.4. Results  The results of our empirical research based on our explorative case study is that the intention to use self and e-assessments can be explained by Davis perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use Furthermore antecedents of perceived usefulness are perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings derived of the MATH e ll as th e [36]. Statistical  support can be provided for all the hypothesized relations between constructs except of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness  5. Limitations  As with any work in a new field of research relevant literature about self- and e-assessments to build on is almost nonexistent. Unfortunately the operationalization of "perceived cost and time savings" as well as perceived quality improvements  in this paper could consequently not build on earlier work too much so we had to derive them of the MATH m  w e ll as t h e UT A U T  36   As with any empirical field study, this work has limitations. It is important to note that we have build an explorative model to examine the acceptance of self- and e-assessments.

on the intention to use self- and e-assessment center as well as the influence of PQI, PCS and PTS on PU it might represent a single example for a specific economy, country or cultural region . There might be differences for the intention of different informnation systems with different settings. Future research should discuss this issue more detailed  Furthermore our questionnaire was just answered by large-scale corporations in Germany. So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
