cloud computing resource demand estimation survey 
C LOUD computing nowadays has a huge impact on many IT solutions for mostly big but also small and medium sized enter 
prises 3 Many popular Cloud de“nitions e.g from Vaquero et al and the NIST definition of Cloud computing highlight the most important bene“ts of Cloud computing Those bene“ts are the exibility and scalability the cost bene“ts of the pay-as-you-go principle and the possibility to access it from almost everywhere worldwide with different devices On the other hand there still exist many challenges in Cloud computing that seem to be 
not or only partially solved 7 8 The biggest challenges found in the literature are data security and privacy but also vendor lockin and uncertainty about the actual cost and time bene“t play quite a key role We highlight the most important expectations and concerns that enterprises raise based on those bene“ts and challenges whilst considering moving the whole or parts of their IT infrastructure into 
the Cloud This work further elaborates on the question if they are justi“ed or not Finally we particularly emphasize the importance of resource demand estimation in this particular area 
1.1 Enterprises and Cloud Computing 
Due to the above characteristics of Cloud computing many enterprises aim to reduce their capital expenditure CAPEX and the overall cost and to increase their exibility A survey 
by Narasimhan et al revealed that companies which already use the Cloud are more interested in gaining exibility and improved mobile access for their services than cost reduction Gupta et al also discover ed that the number one reason for especially small and medium sized enterprises SMEs to use the Cloud is surprisingly not cost reduction but

business agility For the most part cost reduction is still an important factor which leads to the conclusion that the objective for most companies is to provide business agility and mobile access while keeping the cost as low as possible One of the biggest concerns about Cloud computing since the beginning is data security and privacy 11 That is still the case for many Cloud adopters that are already using the Cloud but other factors are almost as important  factors like reliability customizability user adoption and ease of integration In fact 28 percent of the cloud adaptors which already are using the cloud state that the security concerns are one of the biggest misconceptions about Cloud computing More than half of the respondents believe that Cloud solutions perform better in terms of security compared to on-premise applications which is also the case for many other important properties Those are shown in Figure 1 Since business agility and cost are still important concerns it is useful to be able to predict the amount of necessary resources in advance so that a suf“cient amount of them can be set up in advance That is not only useful because it usually takes some time for a virtual compute instance to be up and running from the time it has been started Being able to predict in which point of time a speci“c application needs more resources can be used to reserve the necessary amount of compute instances in advance which is usually cheaper than requesting them on the y The execution of scienti“c applications or analytical processes in the Cloud is also rapidly gaining popularity In many previous works it has been shown that outsourcing of computational expensive tasks in the Cloud can be bene“cial In Deelman et al simulated the cost performance of different execution and resource provisioning plans for a real-life astronomy application and found out that cost can be signi“cantly reduced with no significant impact on application performance by provisioning the right amount of storage and compute resources We discovered that for parallel applications the correct setup of instances can even reduce the runtime and cost of an application due to the fact that virtual compute instances are usually provided as packed resources consisting of CPU hard disk and memory The application we used in our study consumes mostly compute power Thus it is more ef“cient to select smaller compute instances with less memory but a better processing unit On the other hand it would be fatal to choose an instance with less memory than the application actually requires since that would result in swapping He et al measured already in 2010 that virtualization technology adds only a little performance overhead whilst executing HPC applications in the Cloud However they also pointed out that due to the slow networking performance of virtual compute nodes in public clouds the application of a private cloud is more bene“cial Nonetheless they promoted that public Cloud platforms can also be utilized by scientists despite those de“ciencies Although private Clouds seem to be the best solution concerning runtime especially network performance and security they are not applicable in a scenario where data or services have to be provided publicly Also many public Cloud providers offer different types of virtual compute instances which offer different bene“ts for one application Therefore it is helpful

to predict in advance which platform offers the instances with the best performance for a speci“c task or if it is even useful to utilize multiple platforms at once The remainder of this paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we highlight different challenges in resource demand estimation After general dif“culties we focus on speci“c challenges for public Clouds and hybrid Clouds in particular Next in Section 3 we present different existing solutions for resource demand estimation which represent the current state in this area of research We focus on their applicability in solving the challenges we mentioned earlier and especially in hybrid Cloud scenarios Finally we conclude this work in Section 4 and present possible solutions to the problems which are still remaining Many researchers concerned themselves with resource demand estimation and the associated challenges in this research area Already in 1998 Dilleya et al worked out different factors affecting the performance of a single web server Those ar e for example the web server pool size the underlying network topology and server system con“guration properties like the HTTP object cache size An obvious dif“culty is to consider many different types of hardware or arbitrary applications with different properties Especially for distributed computing resource demand estimation is most effective if only one type of resource package has to be considered In the optimal case a certain number of those resources have to be allocated to compute jobs that all have the same properties Unfortunately that is generally not the case That the distribution of jobs in Cloud computing is important has already been demonstrated by researchers Stantchev con“rmed that replication con“gurations in Cloud computing can have a positive effect on non-functional properties using benchmarking He measur ed an incr ease of transactions per second and a decrease of response time with his experimental setup Chieu et al discovered that an effective use of the dynamic scaling property in Cloud computing is possible for Web applications Another important challenge besides network and Cloud related issues is the capability of an estimation system to detect necessary resource adaptions in real-time if not even in advance since it usually takes up to one minute for a compute instance in the Cloud to be available after requesting it To be cost ef“cient it is also important to not reserve more resources than actually required Too many unused resources can be a major problem in a data center as well especially in private Clouds where those resources cannot be utilized by other applications Thus a tradeoff has to be made between meeting quality of service QoS requirements and high resource utilization Stefano et al discover ed many factors affecting the design of load balancing algorithms in distributed systems The most important ones include the current workload of a host and information about the structure of a process Thus it is required to monitor the application state for applications with a variable load for ef“cient load-balancing Based on the amount of information that is available from monitoring three different categories for load-balancing algorithms exist Black-box approaches where no information about the actual workload is available and only the execution time can be measured grey-box approaches that allow at least access to operating system speci“c values like memory consumption or CPU utilization and white-box approaches which allow the complete monitoring of the whole system including application speci“c variables For the most part it is only possible to use a grey-box if not only a black-box approach If only the latter is possible another level of complexity is added to the resource demand estimation system A load-balancing approach called Sandpiper that relies on a greybox and a black-box approach to monitor and detect hotspots in virtual environments and to eliminate them has been presented by Wood et al They con“rm that a gr ey-box appr oach can indeed improve the responsiveness of their system

To reduce the effort of setting up and con“guring a data center to increase business agility reduce the CAPEX and allow better access for mobile devices public Clouds offer a convenient solution However new challenges arise with the application of public Clouds like frequently changing APIs This alone is nowadays not problematic but since vendor lock-in is still a major concern about public Clouds it almost became mandatory to provide support for multiple platforms Unfortunately every platform has its own characteristics and due to the lack of standardization its own interfaces and APIs for accessing them Managing that is not an easy task so a good resource demand estimation application should make use of a good Cloud integration strategy or utilize existing middleware for that task as well Another reason why the utilization of different public Clouds is preferable is the huge performance differences between them That means the performance of an application and thus its resource allocation strongly depends on the Cloud provider Further performance differences in a single Cloud exist as well The performance of a compute instance can depend on points in time the physical locations of the machines and the choice of the virtual system type Dejun et al also concluded that different instances of the same type can have a different performance whilst the performance of a single instance is relatively stable Further problems for resource demand estimation are the throughput instability and delay variations in virtual networks discovered by Wang and Ng They observed that cer tain types of virtual compute instances only receive a 40 to 50 share of the processor which can cause very unstable TCP/UDP throughput among those instances They further observed abnormally large packet delay variations among all instance types and concluded that the unstable network performance can indeed dramatically in”uence the results of network performance techniques This problem however seems to be only related to public Clouds He et al pointed out that due to the slow networking performance of virtual compute nodes in public clouds the application of a private cloud is more bene“cial Although a public Cloud has the bene“t of reduced CAPEX and better deployment speed private Clouds are even more popular amongst enterprises according to a survey by IDG in June 2013 1  The survey revealed that companies tend to optimize existing infrastructure with the implementation of a private Cloud which results in a lower total cost of ownership TCO Despite that fact 59 percent of the respondents have a portion of their IT environment in the public Cloud Therefore they are in fact working in a hybrid Cloud environment Considering the above statement about slow virtual networks in public Clouds that is a good decision but it leads to another level of complexity for resource demand estimation algorithms After determining if a certain task can be executed in the public Cloud or not based on security policies it must be decided if it is faster or maybe cheaper to execute this task in the public or in the private Cloud or if both should be utilized for complex applications Factors like the resource capacity of a private Cloud which is usually much less than of a public Cloud play an important role and as mentioned before the fact that some parts of an application may need to be publicly available Numerous approaches to predict or estimate resource demand in the Cloud exist already Here we classify them as either single or multiple resource type systems The former perform best if only one type of resource package or virtual machine VM is available and predict the amount of VMs allocated to one speci“c application or a number of different applications Usually load-balancing systems belong to this category Multiple resource type systems aim to select the best VM type for one application out of different sized VMs This selection process can also involve multiple Clouds Conditions 1 http://www.eweek.com/cloud enterprises-prefer-private-clouds-survey 2013-09-18

3.1 Single Resource Type Solutions 
for the selection process are usually based on a service level agreement SLA QoS requirements or simply minimizing runtime or cost An optimal solution should be able to select the most appropriate Cloud provider including private Clouds and the necessary number of compute instances of all available VM types for arbitrary applications Although most load-balancing systems cannot be used to estimate the resources for an application that is not already running they become vital for managing resources for running applications with a variable load Some very good approaches do already exist e.g the Sandpiper system by Wood et al which we mentioned above An approach for dynamically estimating CPU demands of applications using CPU measurements from previous executions has been presented by Paci“ci et al in 2008 They formulated a multivariate linear regression problem and used a linear model to solve it They further addressed practical issues like insigni“cant ows collinear ows space and temporal variations and background noise Problems with their approach have been the long response times of the system capturing background noises and missing scaling and standardization techniques Gong et al introduced PRESS a PRedictive Elastic ReSource Scaling scheme for Cloud systems which makes a prediction of future demand based on patterns extracted from previous executions It uses the average value of the samples in each prediction window or alternatively a state-based prediction approach using a discrete-time Markov chain PRESS showed high accuracy resulting in low over provisioning and almost none under provisioning However it is not applicable in a hybrid Cloud environment and not able to consider different types of virtual machines at the moment Isci et al implemented a completely non-utility based approach for CPU demand estimation which performed well in comparison to other utility based solutions They consider ed an increase in the service time of a virtual machine as indicator for performance degradation Thus their technique is independent from the structure of an application as well as the underlying operating system which makes it more exible The downside is that this blackbox approach cannot really predict a resource demand in advance but on the other hand it is quick enough to respond to demand changes almost immediately Kousiouris et al presented a two-level generic black-box approach for behavioral-based management across different Cloud layers They identi“ed patterns in high-level information and translated them to low-level resource attributes This approach showed notably good prediction accuracy and seems to be even generic enough to work with different Cloud environments including private Clouds It is further fast enough to predict changes in real time Unfortunately it may not be applicable in a hybrid Cloud environment which would be preferred to optimize the runtime and cost across multiple Clouds A method to measure the elasticity in Cloud computing has been developed by Islam et al Their appr oach is QoS r elated and also of particular interest for resource demand estimation in order to make assumptions on how quick a certain Cloud platform can scale up or down To measure the elasticity they use a penalty model that penalizes imperfections in elasticity for a given workload in monetary units We found that this model can also be used for an optimization function to support resource demand estimation approaches that rely on data mining techniques The developed algorithms for calculating the over and under provisioning penalties are given in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 respectively It is important to mention that the automation of this approach is also possible if the QoS measurements of the customer are known The downside of this method is that it requires extensive benchmarking In Islam et al developed a method to predict resource provisioning using machine learning algorithms They veri“ed their approach with experimental results using neural networks and linear regression as learning algorithms The prediction accuracy is quite notable which allows achieving on-demand resource allocation in the Cloud even with sev

Calculation of the over provisioning penalty according to Islam et al and represent the start and end time the cost for a resource and  and the available chargeable and actual supply at time respectively Calculation of the under provisioning penalty according to Islam et al is a set of QoS properties and the amount of unsatisfactory behavior at time  This amount is mapped to the nancial impact in  The limit of acceptable unsatisfactory behavior at time is donated by  eral minutes delay in the hardware resource allocation However the experiments were only performed using the TPC-W benchmark yet and for just a single VM type Accordingly it is not certain that this method works for arbitrary applications or in hybrid Cloud environments Many of the previously examined approaches have in common that they were only designed and tested for scalable web applications which are a suitable target to apply dynamic scaling or load-balancing algorithms to But for HPC or even arbitrary applications those approaches are either not applicable or have not been thoroughly tested yet 3.2 Multiple Resource Type Solutions Most resource demand estimation solutions that allow the selection of a speci“c resource type focus on selecting one out of multiple Cloud providers for a certain application This approach is popular because of the huge performance differences between Cloud providers which we explained already However it is almost as important to select the correct types and number of VMs that should be used Amazon for example offers 17 different compute instance types with different speci“cations each 2  Li et al performed several benchmarks to compare public Cloud providers and derived from that a performance estimation to select the best provider for a certain job Although their approach which is called CloudCmp may not include the accurate prediction of runtime or cost for the selected Cloud provider it delivers a pretty good estimation which provider suits best for a speci“c application An alternate approach has been developed by Kaisler et al Their decision framework is designed to assist managers to decide which Cloud alternative is the right for their application case based on speci“c requirements like business objectives QoS attributes and architectural decisions They also pointed out that different pricing strategies offered to the user by a single Cloud provider should be taken into account i.e many providers offer pre-paid instances which are cheaper than usual They state in their conclusion that especially SMEs or Cloud beginners should start off with a small private Cloud and then eventually move critical parts of their IT to a public Cloud However although this approach may help selecting a Cloud provider it does not offer any real resource demand estimation The most promising approach to our knowledge has been presented by Li et al With their approach called CloudProphet they are able to predict application performance in the Cloud for arbitrary applications In their work they use a trace and replay method which means the application is executed locally and the same workload is emulated in the Cloud 2 http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types 2013-09-24

The performance of the agent that emulated the workload is used to predict the performance after migration The accuracy of this method is notably high and in combination with CloudCmp this approach offers very good support for selecting the right Cloud provider for an application without executing it in the Cloud However their approach has been tested on a single compute instance type only so it does not consider different instance types yet An obvious dif“culty for this goal is the high effort and expenses for executing an agent on all different instance types This effort needs to be reduced Although that goal could be achieved with little effort using regression methods it would reduce the prediction accuracy by a notable amount which is not desirable Hybrid Clouds were also not considered in the literature yet but as this approach works with multiple public Cloud providers already this seems to be only a minor problem Another problem is that it is not certain if this approach works for scienti“c or high performance applications as well since it has not been tested with those kind of applications either Supposedly this is due to the usually huge workload of those applications so the trace and replay method would be very slow and expensive in such a case In this work we presented current challenges for resource demand estimation in Cloud computing and analyzed existing approaches for solving those challenges We discovered that many of these problems can already be solved by most of the solutions but some important research challenges remain For most of the approaches it is still unclear whether the presented approaches are applicable in a hybrid Cloud environment This problem could be solved by utilizing Cloud integration techniques or middleware to support the estimation algorithm Another bene“t of this approach is the resulting simpli“cation of the development process Further the increasing number of HPC applications in the Cloud contains a huge potential for saving resources and thus energy and cost if resource demand estimation algorithms can be properly applied Current solutions cannot yet meet that demand since usually extensive benchmarking is required to be able to accurately predict the resource demand for future jobs For HPC applications this effort is not feasible To overcome this issue a method to predict the demand of a large scale experiment based on previously executed benchmarks of small scale experiments needs to be developed We suggest the utilization of state of the art regression techniques However this method may only be applicable to grey-box if not only whitebox approaches and the prediction accuracy will possibly still be reduced by a notable amount More research in that direction should help to discover exactly how the prediction accuracy is in”uenced and to derive possible solutions for that Since it is rather dif“cult to develop a solution for arbitrary applications we propose that it will be useful to utilize classi“cation techniques like decision tree or naive Bayes to classify applications after a single or a few small scale benchmarks rst After that the most appropriate regression technique to estimate the large scale resource consumption can be applied based on the application class e.g IO-intensive compute intensive or memory intensive Finally taking different VM types of each Cloud provider into account is still not supported by most of the approaches which is due to frequent changes and lack of standardization in this area Data mining techniques like regression could be applied as well to partially solve this problem but as discussed already the prediction accuracy may suffer from this additional complexity To fully overcome this last challenge more standardized resource descriptions and reliable provisioning of resources in Cloud computing is necessary This research project was promoted and funded by the European Union and the Free State of Saxony The authors take the responsibility for the content of this publication

  15 somewhat different to implement the required spectral ranges of the 4 channels A common broad community question is how the SNR of a measurement at airship altitude can be related directly to that of geostationary deployment. The answer, as people versed in the field know, is that for viewing a uniform extended source, up close or far away, the SNR does not change if the source fills the field of view of the pixel, i.e the footprint. The footprint area and therefore the number of photons emitted from the footprint, N EF increases as the square of the distance to the source, D 2 but the fraction of N EF incident on the aperture decreases as D 2 so the signal and therefore the SNR, remains invariant to D.  In contrast if a source, e.g., a star, fills only a part of the footprint, then the SNR does decrease as a function of the distance to the star. In the case of an imaging spectrometer, if the telescope images the uniform extended source on to the slit with a beam of the specified focal ratio, i.e., f/number, then the SNR is constant no matter the distance to that source A hopefully simple example follows. Consider the TIMS 2010 campaign with airship a ltitude 0.362 km On viewing from this altitude the per pixel footprint along the slit is 5.43 cm. Multiplying by the ratio of geostationary to airship altitudes \(36217/0.362\rows the pixel footprint to 5.43 km and importantly maintains a full field of view of the extended earth surface light source, exactly the same as in the case of deployment on the airship. To \221zoom in\222 and reduce the size of the footprint to the desired 2.7 km along the north - south \(NS\t direction requires doubling the effective focal length from aperture to slit and the aperture diameter must also be doubled to maintain the f/3 focal ratio from telescope aperture to the slit. As discussed above whether physically moving or optically zooming, the SNR for a footprint on an extended source is unchanged geoCARB focal plane assemblies \(FPAs 226 These are to be Teledyne 1024 x 1024 format H1RGs. The unit pixels are identical to those of the NIRCAM shortwave camera which uses a Teledyne H2RG with 2048 x 2048 format. The electronics to operate the NIRCAM H2RG aboard the James Webb Space Telescope mission have been developed here at the LM ATC. For the geoCARB application the  H1RG FPAs require cooling to 125 K in order to render negligible dark  current contribution to zero level instability and noise. To achieve this an enclosure that includes from the input slits through to the FPAs will be kept at 125 K That would also ensure there are no spectrometer thermal photons to contribute to zero level instability and noise. The camera electronics would be adaptations of those developed for the NIRCAM short wave camera The TIMS Teledyne HAWAII-1 FPA and the H1RG are very similar. The H1RG is the current generation of the HAWAII series and the TIMS FPA is first generation Comparison is given in table 6. The newer generation has improved pixel to pixel uniformity Table 6.

To achieve high SNR in low light conditions a 4.08s exposure \(or stare time is used. For the same purpose the slit is two pixels wide \(5.4 km wide EW on the earth\he slit  is scanned 2.7 km  per step in the EW direction in a step and stare operation \(4.08s stare time + 0.34s move time\his provides spatial over-sampling by a factor of  two. The resulting E/W scan rate is 2400 km per observing hour and facilitates mapping of  the gases CO 2 CH 4 and CO with 2.7 km sample spacing on continental size regions several times per day The optical design code, using actual tolerances as have been achieved in previous LM ATC space instrument builds predicts spatial resolutions per sample of 4.1 km NS and 5.4 km EW Per 4.08s stare time twelve consecutive spectral images or frames, with 340 ms integration times are acquired and coadded per pixel to a 1024  x 1024 buffer array. The coadded buffer comprises the spectral image that is reported to telemetry.  Correlated double sampling \(CDS\used per each of the 12 frames. In order to suppress inter-pixel capacitance noise to the requirement of 0.1%/pixel the CDS sampling is achieved by processing each successive row  with two consecutive  resets between reads \(read-reset then reset-read\plementation requires use of all 16 H1RG outputs clocked at 386 kHz.  The short 340 ms sample time avoids saturation for the brightest expected signals, while co-adding extends the dynamic range for geoCARB Band Table 7.

Considering the geostationary viewing operational advantage for selecting optimal cos\(SZA\, the mission median SNR in the 4 channels should be at least as large as listed in Table 8, that is SNR >> 200 in all 4 channels These are large enough to enable retrieval of CO 2 CH 4 and CO column mixing ratio per footprint with mission median precisions significantly < 0.7, 1.0 and 10.0 %, respectively 12  Estimating T SYS for the 1.61 \265m case The basis for the pessimistic estimate of T SYS 0.283 for the 1.61 \265m channel is shown in Table 9. The end of life factor is the product of NVR = 0.995, particulates = 0.983 scatter= 0.984 and contingency =0.990. The T SYS for the other channels was similarly estimated The 1.61 \265m grating efficiency 63%  in Table 9 is considerably larger than the TIMS\222 as seen in Table 5. The former was custom made with blaze optimized for the application such that the target order contains the majority of the diffracted light, and all other orders are quite dim. In contrast, the TIMS grating is an off the shelf part, not optimized for application in the TIMS target spectral region The vendor has indicated that for the TIMS application the available target order competes with another approximately equally bright order for the major share of the light in the target spectral range.   Therefore the TIMS grating efficiency \(Table 5 above\ considerably less than the optimized geoCARB grating efficiency Conclusion for Section 6 In this section we have described the multichannel geostationary application geoCARB that exploits the TIMS design approach; the operations and measurements; and some of the performance characteristics including application of the TIMS noise model to predict SNR performance. The performance satisfies the mission requirements for mapping several times daily on continental scales with spatial sampling and resolution of several km and with very high SNR per spectral sample per footprint 7.

  18 noise model in Section 4; the validation of the noise model against the best available data set, acquired in the 2008 joint campaign with the University  of Denver, in Section 5; and in section 6 a 4-channel space application of TIMS called geoCARB to acquire data in the O 2 A-band, the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, and a channel near 2.32  265m for CH 4 and CO, with capability from geostationary to map continental scales several times per day on contiguous samples with spacing the order 3 km at the sub satellite point. The geoCARB instrument and operational parameters input to the validated TIMS noise model, and the expectation for mission median values of cos\(SZA\ lead the conservative expectation for SNR 200 in the 4 geoCARB channels. This provides ample margin for retrieval of column mixing ratios of CO 2 CH 4  and CO with mission median precisions 0.7, 1.0 and 10 per footprint, respectively.
