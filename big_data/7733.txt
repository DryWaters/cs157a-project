Analysis of Discipline Development Discrepancy between the Provincial Cities of China Based on Output of Scientific Papers  Jingjing Wang, Qiang Wu School of Management University of Science and Technology of China Hefei, Anhui 230027, China e-mail: qiangwu@ustc.edu.cn Jingjing Wang  Department of Computer Science & Technology Hefei University Hefei, Anhui 230022, China e-mail: jjw@mail.ustc.edu.cn   Abstract Scientific paper is a key factor representing the degree of discipline development in a city or a country. Based on the database of Web of Science we comparatively analyzed the outputs of the scientific papers, indexed by Science Citation Index, between 31 provincial cities of China in 10 disciplines of natural science during 2005–2007. The paper quantities for each city as well as the whole country were steadily growing at this stage. The political center Beijing and the economic center Shanghai shared 27.3% and 13.2% of all scientific papers published by these cities, respectively. In contrast, each of the ranked last 13 cities had only a share of lower than 1%. Our data indicated that there were big discrepencies between the provincial cities of China for the development of the disciplines investigated Keywords-discipline development; provincial cities of China science citation index; Scientific paper I   I NTRODUCTION  Science and technology is well known to be the most powerful drive for social and economic development. Most of the results of research work in all disciplines are embodied as scientific papers, patents, academic reports and other scientific materials, among which scientific papers are generally conceived to be a key factor [1   T hus a st a t i s t i c  analysis of scientific papers, published by a country or a city, is helpful to understand their statuses of discipline development and to further estimate their scientific and technological strengths [2   The number of scientific papers at a certain period can be easily calculated whereas their qualities are hard to be evaluated. The quality of a paper is often estimated by a few parameters such as impact factor of citation [3 an d citatio n  frequency [4  B y u s i ng t h e s e p a r a m e t e r s  J o ur na l  Ci t a t i o n Reports, published every year since 1975 by American Institute of Science and Technology Information, has performed a relatively objective evaluation for scientific papers published in a country or a specific discipline In China, the provincial cities are nearly the key regions of economic development and the center of scientific research for each province or municipalities [5  To  understand the current statuses of the discipline development in 31 provincial cities of China, we retrieved the database of Web of Science \(WOS\or obtaining the information of scientific papers in 10 disciplines of natural science during 2005–2007 and comparatively analyzed the discrepancies of the paper quantities between these cities II  M ETHODS  All of scientific papers, indexed by Science Citation Index \(SCI\, were obtained via retrieving the WOS database The rank of a city in a specific subject of a discipline was estimated based on the total number of scientific papers in this subject [6  T h e f i n a l ran k o f a city  w a s th en o b t a in e d  according to the mathematical formula R 000 S 1 S 2 S n  Note that R, S and n represent the final rank, the numerical value of rank for a specific subject, and the subject number of a discipline, respectively. The final ranks obtained were used to access the degrees of discipline development for the 31 principal cities of China selected III  R ESULTS  A  Total number of scientific papers of China during 2005–2007 Based on the statistic data of scientific papers indexed by SCI, the total numbers for China were steadily increasing during the three years, though the growth rate in 2006 was relatively lower \(Table I TABLE I  SCI INDEXED PAPERS OF C HINA DURING 2005–2007  7    Year Paper number x 10 4  Growth rate International share International rank 2005 6.8 18.9 5.3 5 2006 7.1 4.3 5.9 5 2007 8.9 25.2 7.0 5  B  City ranks in each discipline The ranks of the 31 provincial cities in each of the 10 disciplines investigated were obtained based on the quantity of their scientific papers in a discipline published during 2005–2007. As shown in Table 2, the capital city Beijing had the largest number of scientific papers in each discipline and thus ranked first. The economic center Shanghai ranked second in most of the disciplines except Agriculture and Mathematics & Multidisciplinary. However, the five provincial cities of Huhehaote, Xining, Yinchuan, Haikou

The paper numbers increased year by year nearly for every city \(Table 3 resulting in an overall increase of scientific papers of China Table 1\. Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan and Hangzhou ranked orderly the top five cities \(Table 3\ whose publication contributed to 58% of the total number of scientific papers published by the 31 cities during 2005 2007. However, the last 20 cities had only a contribution of 20.8%. In particular, each of the last 13 cities had a contribution of lower than 1%.

But it should be noted that the development of disciplines in natural science had an unneglectable discrepency between the cities: the political center Beijing \(with 69,001 papers during 2005–2007\nd the economic center Shanghai \(with 33,549 papers\ had 27.3% and 13.2% of all scientific papers investigated respectively, which were overwhelmingly higher than those of other cities; in contrast, each of the ranked last 13 cities from Zhengzhou to Lasa had only a share of lower than 1 The discrepency of discipline development between these cities may together caused by several factors such as economic, policy, history and geographical position and conditions, etc., among which regional economic success and policy tendency undoubtedly act as the direct drives for the current development of science and technology

 Pressure measurements will be made using pressure transducers mounted on the inside of the MSL heatshield and connected to the outside surface through tubing and a through-hole port in the TPS material MISP plug and the cavity in the TPS SLA shown with heatshield structure in which it is installed using a standard LMSSC TPS repair technique MEDLI utilizes one autonomous mode upon initiation of power the SSE will begin conditioning and digitizing the sensor signals From cruise stage separation until heatshield separation the DPAM will request the MEDLI sensor data from the SSE and the RCE in the rover will request and store the acquired data from the DPAM The DPAM will request the data from each address assigned to MEDLI at a 64 Hz rate The SSE multiplexes the MEDLI data into these addresses achieving effective sample rates of 8 Hz 2 Hz and lHz for its various sensors This data is held in a buffer in the DPAM and transferred across the EDL-1553 bus at the request of the RCE These are standard functions of the DPAM and RCE and require only changes to the look-up table that selects the channels to be sampled and their sample rate MSL Accommodations MSL provides the accommodations for the MEDLI instrumentation and avionics MSL provides the mechanical electrical and avionics interfaces as shown in Figure 4 The MEDLI mass allocation is 12.5 kg on the heatshield for the SSE MEADS and MISP and 2.5 kg on the backshell for power avionics cabling and the associated cable cutters The power allocation for MEDLI is 30W during EDL while no power is provided during the launch and cruise phases The avionics interface to the DPAM is an RS-422 bus The memory allocation in the RCE is 1.5 Mbytes for storage of the acquired data The cable harness from the SSE to the DPAM is routed through a cable cutter at the heatshield/backshell interface and then through a second cable cutter at the descent stage/backshell interface The components mounted on the inside of the heatshield the MEADS transducers and the SSE are fastened to standard inserts in the heatshield structure with thermal isolation standoffs A custom designed through-hole with a stainless steel sleeve provides a clear and secure path from the port in the TPS through the heatshield honeycomb structure to the pressure transducer mounted in the heatshield interior The sensor plugs will be integrated into the TPS by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Corporation LMSSC using a flight-qualified TPS repair procedure MISP MISP is an instrumented plug that is installed in the TPS Each plug is made from the heatshield TPS material and includes four embedded thermocouples at varying depths and one recession sensor The sensor wiring is routed through penetrations in the TPS behind each plug and through the heatshield structure Figure 5 illustrates the Backshel  Heatsh Figure 4 MSL Accommodations and Interfaces Each MISP plug is 33 mm 1.3 in diameter with a total depth of 20.3 mm 0.8 and contains four Type K thermocouples The thermocouples are installed in a Ushaped design at 2.54 5.08 10.16 15.24 mm 0.1 0.2 0.4 and 0.6 from the surface of the plug The plug itself is installed flush to the overall outer surface of the TPS The MISP plug does not extend all the way to the structural interface bondline Therefore since TC depths are defined from the outer surface the overall MISP design is insensitive to changes in the heatshield TPS thickness The top two thermocouples in each plug are used primarily to reconstruct the aerothermal environment during entry and descent while the two deeper thermocouples are used to validate the thermal response of the TPS material At some locations the near surface thermocouples may fail during descent due to over temping This is expected and occurs due to the desire to select a single set of TC depths that is globally optimized for all seven locations and a wide variety of possible entry trajectories The recession sensor named Hollow aErothermal Ablation and Temperature HEAT is shown schematically in Figure 6 The HEAT sensor measures the temporal progression of a 700 K isotherm through the TPS during entry and descent This sensor operates on similar principles to the Analog Resistance Ablation Detector ARAD flown on the Galileo probe,12 but the design has been significantly modified to allow for accommodation into a variety of TPS materials and to produce improved signal quality and reduction of signal dropouts A constant current excitation of 1 mA is provided by the SSE The sensor element becomes electrically conductive as the surface of the TPS and the HEAT sensor is charred As the char layer-virgin material interface advances the HEAT length and voltage output decreases The measurement range is 0 to 13 mm 0 to 0.52 from the TPS outer mold line with a measurement 6

to meet 23 grms launch loads and 28 grms entry loads as required by MSL Standoffs provide clearance for MSL's multi-layer insulating MLI blanket located on the interior of the heatshield The pressure path is simple and requires two flare fitting connections between the heatshield outer mold line OML and the pressure transducer The selection of stainless steel for the tubing mitigates the risk of bumthrough during entry The pigtail in the tube provides strain relief for mechanical and thermal distortions during launch cruise and entry Since power is not provided to MEDLI during the cruise phase the expected thermal environment at the pressure transducer location prohibited incorporating conditioning electronics in the gauge head Through a two wire interface the pressure reading is transmitted to the SSE where the signal is appropriately conditioned Key aspects of the transducer specification are shown in Table 3 Table 3 MEADS Pressure Transducer Specifications Key Parameter Specification Pressure range 0-35kPa 0-5 psia Accuracy 0.500 of reading Temperature range 225\260C to 125\260C Mass less than 368 grams digital converter Each sample is 16 bits wide with two bits reserved for data synchronization MEDLI will generate approximately 0.9 MBytes during operations The raw data rate from MEDLI to the DPAM is 4 kilobits per second The DPAM will add 1/64 second time tags 16 bits each to each data frame resulting in an additional 225 Kbytes for 30 minutes of operation The total MEDLI data volume is expected to be 1.13 MBytes Memory is allocated in the Rover Compute Element RCE when MEDLI instrumentation is activated approximately ten minutes before atmospheric interface and is held until the MEDLI data is transmitted to Earth 6.35mm 0.25 OD 0.89mm 0.035 wall Stainless Steel Tube with Strain Relief Loop A r  S Spool Insert Pressure Transducer Sensor Head Kl 3xG-10 standoffs V 3x Inserts   NAS-1 832 Spool Through a Request For Proposal RFP acquisition process a source selection board selected transducers from Stellar Technology Incorporated STI that utilize a strain gauge pressure measurement approach The temperature of each transducer head is also recorded through a TC mounted on each transducer housing SSE The SSE contains two electronic boards housed in a 76.2 x 247.7 x 336.6 mm 3.0 x 9.75 x 13.25 aluminum chassis The 158.75 x 304.8 mm 6.25 x 12.0 digital board contains the RS-422 interface and power interface to the DPAM An ACTEL field-programmable gate array will manage the analog-to-digital converter and provide the RS422 electrical interface The digital board also provides conditioning of the MSL provided 28V power and conversion to 15.OV 5.OV and 2.5V power and contains the pressure transducer signal conditioning electronics The analog board also 158.75 x 304.8 mm 6.25 x 12.0 in size contains the interface for up to 24 thermocouples from the sensor plugs up to seven thermocouples for the pressure transducers up to six HEAT sensor inputs and the pressure transducer signals conditioned on the digital board A multiplexer routes all inputs into a single 14 bit analog-toFigure 7 MEADS Overview Each of the TC inputs and HEAT inputs use transient voltage suppressors to ensure that sensor anomalies do not damage the processing electronics In addition to the sensor signals a series of housekeeping signals including cold junction compensation CJC signals reference voltages and chassis temperature are recorded As shown in Table 4 77 channels are recorded in total Table 5 shows the sample strategy for the MISP plugs The sample rates for each TC were determined based on expected responses from aerothermal and TPS thermal response modeling analysis In each plug TC1 is the TC nearest the OML 2.54 mm 0.1 depth and TC4 is nearest the bondline 15.24 mm 0.6 depth The interface to the DPAM limits the number of channels and sample rate The HEAT sensor from location T4 is at the stagnation point where little recession is expected Hence its signal will not be recorded this channel was employed for additional reference temperature and HEAT calibration measurements The deeper TCs at locations T5 and T7 will not be recorded because only 24 total TC channels are available and these four locations were prioritized lowest in terms of satisfaction of MISP science objectives 8

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services.
