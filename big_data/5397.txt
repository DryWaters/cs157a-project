Abstract 
With flexible and scalable features for fine-grained access control, Ciphertext Policy Attribute-based Encryption \(CP 
ABE\ is widely used as a kind of data protection mechanism in the cloud computing. However, the access policy of CP-ABE scheme may contain sensitive information which causes privacy revelation of the data provider or receiver. Some papers proposed hidden policy CP-ABE scheme, which are based on And-gate access structure whose expressive ability of access policy is limited. CPABE with the tree-based access structure has stronger expressive ability and more flexible access control capability. Therefore, it has broad application prospects compared to other mechanisms This paper proposes a tree-based access structure CP-ABE scheme with hidden policy \(CP-ABE-HP\, which can both protect 
the policy and has flexible access control capability. We prove the Chosen-plaintext Attack \(CPA\ security of our scheme under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman \(DBDH\ assumption in the standard model

 I NTRODUCTION  With the development of cloud computing, the cloud storage is becoming a popular way of data storage for enterprises or individuals. In the cloud storage environment, the protective ability of data becomes very important, because data is out of the userês control domain and the cloud storage service provider 
I 
may be unreliable. Data encryption, currently the primary means to protect data, cannot satisfy data protection requirements in various online applications which own a large amount of users due to its complex key management mechanism and poor scalability. Therefore, a new data oriented protection mechanism is urgently needed, in which data has the ability to protect its confidentiality and integrity all by itself rather than depending on the cloud storage server. We call this kind of new data protection the data-centric self-contained protection. Also we believe that this kind of data protection can be achieved by integrating data encryption with data access control 
In recent years, for the situation of uncertain decrypting party, Attribute-based Encryption \(ABE e c h a n i s m   proposed by Sahai and Waters, was developed based on Identity-based encryption mechanism. Without knowing the specific decrypting parties, the data provider encrypts data according to an access structure consisting of a series of attribute descriptions, and the data receiver can decrypt the ciphertext only if he/she satisfies the attribute descriptions in the access structure. With data decryption depending on user attributes, ABE can solve the security problems of outsourced data effectively. At present, ABE can be divided into two types: Key Policy Attribute-based Encryption \(KP-ABE 
and Ciphertext Policy Attribute-based Encryption \(CP-ABE\In KP-ABE, which was proposed by Goyal et al   t he ci p he r t e xt  is associated with a set of attributes and the secret key is associated with the access structure. On the contrary, in CPABE, proposed by Bethencourt et al t h e ci p h er te x t i s  associated with the access structure and the secret key is associated with a set of attributes. In both cases, only when the userês attributes satisfy the access policy related to the ciphertext, can he/she decrypt the ciphertext successfully Consequently, the CP-ABE scheme is more suitable for datacentric self-contained protection in cloud storage environment The CP-ABE scheme currently has three kinds of access 
structures: And-gate access structure, tree-based access structure and Linear Secret Share Scheme \(LSSS\ matrix access structure The tree-based access structure can express much more complex access policy with its hierarchy. Thus, it has a more flexible access control capability for data encryption. Therefore,  CPABE has gained much more attentions in cloud computing In the originally proposed CP-ABE scheme, the access structure is embedded in the ciphertext and whoever obtains the ciphertext can see the content of the access structure. However this full exposure of dataês access policy will disclose sensitive information of the decryption or encryption party. For example 
in commercial environments, the access structure may contain trade secrets; an access structure for secret job information released by a company on public platform may disclose the companyês development direction and strategy. In military applications, the access structures themself may contain military secrets, such as sensitive information like organizational structure, the core combat troops, staff ratio, and firepower configuration of a group army. When utilizing ABE to protect shared data on the Internet, the access policy may also disclose the receiversê privacy information. Meanwhile, in order to avoid

These schemes protect usersê privacy information by establishing security protocols and using encryption to protect access policy against unauthorized access in the security protocols. Recently, the researchers also proposed a series of CP-ABE schemes [7 i t h hi d d e n  po l i c y   B u t t h e s e schemes are based on simple And-gate access structure and their policy expressive ability is limited. To the best of our knowledge, the tree-based access structure CP-ABE scheme with hidden policy has not been proposed at present This paper proposes a tree-based access structure CP-ABE scheme with hidden policy \(CP-ABE-HP\hich is proved to have the Chosen-plaintext Attack \(CPA\curity under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman \(DBDH\ assumption in the standard model. Inspired by the tree-based access structure in ITHJ09 scheme  a nd t he p ol i c y hi d i ng m e t ho d i n And ga t e  access structure CP-ABE which proposed by Xiaohui et al [7   we proposed a more efficient and stronger expressive CP-ABE scheme with hidden policy. Our scheme also uses subgroup elementês orthogonal property in composite order bilinear groups and introduces some random elements into the policy key component The remaining sections are organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce related work. In Section 3, we review some preliminary concepts. We propose the CP-ABE-HP scheme and give analysis in Section 4. In Section 5 we give the security proof of our scheme. We then give an implementation framework of our scheme in cloud computing environment in Section 6. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 7 II R ELATED W ORK  BSW s c he m e   pr opo sed  b y Be t he nco urt  e t a l  us e s  tree-based access structure to express access policy, which supports AND, OR and of threshold operator. Its ciphertext length, time of encryption and decryption, and the number of attributes in the access structure are linear correlation. But the security proof is based on common group model, rather than the standard numerical theoretical assumptions. Cheung and Newport [1  p r im arily c o n s t r u cte d th e C P A s ecu rity C P A B E  mechanism \(CN07\ based on the DBDH assumption.

The scheme introduced an online semi-trusted server, but cannot prevent collusion attacks. To prevent usersê collusion attacks, Yu et al constructed two kind of anonymous CP-ABE mechanism [5 used in CDN network and multicast user groups. However these anonymous mechanisms used strong security assumption so the security level is lower. Nishide et al [6 f i rs tly p r o p o se d  anonymous CP-ABE with hidden policy based on DBDH assumption and D-Linear assumption. But the mechanism only supports AND-gate access structure. In papers [8, 17-19 t h e  authors have proposed different ways to deal with policy hiding issues. Lai et al [8 n ne r p rod uc t P r ed ic a t e E n cr y p t i o n  technology to achieve the hidden policy CP-ABE scheme in fully security model. After that, they also proposed a partial hidden policy scheme a s e d o n L SSS m a tr ix ac cess  structure and pointed out that the structure is more flexible than other scheme [6, 8, 21 Amo ng t h e s e sc he m e s  t h e  p r i v ac y aware ABE proposed by Jin et al [21 aim ed  at  th e pr ev en ti o n  of  usersê collusion attacks.

With And-gate access structure supporting negative attribute and wildcard, a hidden policy scheme, proposed by  Nishanth and Devesh [9 focuse d on the constant size of ciphertext and key. Xiaohui et al also proposed a hidden policy scheme which used And-gate access structure with provably security under the standard model, and it based on Watersê scheme  Considering the security and expressive ability of access policy, only the W08 and ITHJ09 scheme support the AND, OR and threshold operations under the standard numerical theoretical assumptions, and the computation cost of encryption and decryption of ITHJ09 is lower than W08ês. Meanwhile, in terms of hidden policy, all existing CP-ABE schemes are based on And-gate access structure. Though their efficiency has been improved, the expressive ability of policy is limited. In the background of cloud storage applications, CP-ABE scheme with flexible policy expression ability will have broad application prospects. Therefore, the paper focuses on the research of treebased access structure CP-ABE scheme with hidden policy III P RELIMINARIES  Composite order bilinear groups were first introduced by Boneh et al  T h e ord er o f b i l i n ea r g r o u p s w e use d i s t h e product of two distinct primes.

Let  be an efficiently computable bilinear map and is the generator of Choose random numbers The DBDH assumption is that no probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm can distinguish the tuple        from the tuple         with more than a negligible advantage Access Structure [24  L e t   2    if then An access structure \(respectively monotone access structure\ is a collection \(respectively monotone collection of non-empty subsets 2  The sets in are called the authorized sets, and the sets not in are called the unauthorized sets In CP-ABE-HP mechanism, we use attributes instead of the and the access structure will contain the set of authorized attributes The ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption\(CP-ABE scheme consists of four fundamental algorithms [3 Set u p   Encrypt, Key Generation, and Decrypt Setup The setup algorithm takes no input other than the security parameter It outputs the public parameters and a master key  Key-Generation  The key generation algorithm takes the master key and a set of attributes that describe the key as input.

Because the access policy was public, itês useless to protect the ciphertext components of the attributes that were associated with the tree-based access policy However, when the policy was hidden, the only way to find some information about the access policy was to attack the ciphertext components of the attributes. Hence, it is necessary to protect these parts of the ciphertext. In our scheme, we use the property of composite order bilinear groups to achieve the

and In encryption phase and  multiplies by the random elements and  respectively, as shown in equation \(6\ and \(9\. Meanwhile, it does not affect the decryption result in the decryption phase as shown in equation \(11\. So, it can effectively prevent some malicious attacker from testing the access policy by a possible access structure guessing the access structure and getting the anonymous information of receivers The performance analysis of the computing efficiency is shown in Table I. CN07, Emura09 and Xiao12 are the CPABE schemes based on And-gate access structure. Emura09 and Xiao12 scheme have the constant size of the ciphertext and the private key, and Xiao12 scheme realizes a hidden policy scheme. Compared to Emura09 scheme, the Xiao12 scheme has 2 additional computing costs in group during encryption phase to achieve hidden policy, which is necessary for goal of policy hiding. BSW07, ITHJ09 and our scheme all use tree-based access structure, and our scheme increases one and \(|Ac|+1\ computing cost on group compared with BSW07 and ITHJ09 respectively, however the computing was only the non-exponentiation on group Compared with And-gate hidden access policy in Xiao12 scheme, the computing consumption of our scheme is more than Xiao12 scheme during the decryption phase. The reason is that Xiao12 scheme has the constant size of ciphertext and private key. But during the encryption phase, the computing cost of our scheme is lower than Xiao12 scheme V S ECURITY P ROOF  In this section, we give the security proof of CP-ABE-HP scheme. Firstly, we suppose that the IND-sAtt-CPA game can be won by an adversary with a non-negligible advantage We will build a simulator which has the ability to solve the DBDH assumption problem with advantage 2 from the attack ability of adversary The simulator firstly sets the bilinear group of order  and the bilinear map  where and are the distinct primes and and are cyclic groups. Let and be the subgroup of with order and and generator and  respectively. The challenger selects  R 0, 1} and sets as follows   0   1  to the simulator In the attack game, the simulator plays the challenger role of adversary and we refer to it as the challenger in the following IND-sAtt-CPA game Init Phase. The adversary chooses a challenge access Setup Phase. The challenger selects a random element and sets \002  then calculates            1  calculate     1  14  After setting the parameters, the challenger sends the adversary the following public key     1  Phase 1 The adversary sends a user private key query request to the challenger by any attributes set And the attributes set is as follows     and sets   so  0      in the attributes set of private key request from the adversary, we have the following result

Encrypt the message as follows  000 to be and initialize all child nodes as un-assigned and mark the root node as assigned. Recursively, for each un assigned non-leaf, if the nodeês child nodes are un assigned, the challenger select a polynomial  donating the attribute index of challenge tree and  For each child node, the challenger assigns a value and marks this node as assigned The polynomial t with the following rule If the node symbol is threshold operator\ set the polynomial of degree 1, where denotes the number of nodes to recover the secret If the node symbol is set the polynomial of degree 1, where n denotes the number of all leaf nodes If the node symbol is set the polynomial of degree 0, so the is constant number and assign it to each of its child node Phase 2. The adversary continues to send the secret key requests to the challenger with the same restriction as in Phase 1 Guess Phase. The adversary outputs a guess 0 1 If  the challenger can guess that 0     As     is a reasonable simulation of the simulator, the ciphertext is a valid ciphertext in the system. Hence, with the help of adversary, the challenger solves the DBDH assumption problem with the following advantage Pr      1  2 0    Right now the value of    is a random ciphertext relative to the adversary. And the adversary cannot get any information about the plaintext message So, the challenger solves the DBDH assumption problem with the following advantage Pr      1  2  from the to win the IND-sAtt-CPA game, the challenger will solve the DBDH assumption problem with advantage by the help of the adversaryês advantage. However, there are no effective polynomial algorithms which can solve the DBDH assumption problem with non-negligible advantage according to the DBDH assumption. Hence, the adversary also cannot win the IND-sAtt-CPA game with the above advantage namely, the adversary having no advantage to break through CP-ABE-HP system VI A N I MPLEMENTATION F RAMEWORK OF CP-ABE-HP We have implemented a system for data sharing based on the CP-ABE-HP scheme. The system can be used to protect personal data stored in the private cloud or public cloud The framework is shown in Fig.1 The system needs to be initialized by distributing the public parameters to users. If a user wants to share his data with a group of specific users, he just needs to encrypt the data with the access policy under the encrypt algorithm of our scheme, and then he shares the data to the cloud. When the recipient gets the encrypted data from the cloud, he should firstly acquire the private key from the security server. The security server contains two parts, the Attribute Authority\(AA\nd the Private Key Generator\(PKG\The AA firstly authenticates the recipientês attributes, and then asks the PKG to generate the private key containing these authenticated attributes for the recipient, and lastly the AA sends the private key to the recipient. If the recipientês attributes in his private key satisfy the access policy which is corresponding to the ciphertext, he can decrypt the data successfully. Otherwise, he canêt decrypt it VII C ONCLUSIONS  In CP-ABE schemes, policy hidden is of great significance in certain applications for protecting the privacy information of data provider and receiver. By introducing random element of subgroups into the policy key components, and with the property of subgroup elementês orthogonal in composite order bilinear groups, the paper proposed the CP-ABE-HP scheme, which effectively realizes policy hidden in encryption. Meanwhile the treebased access structure of CP-ABE-HP ensures that users can define their policies flexibly. Our scheme has very fewer extra costs of encryption and decryption compared with the

The implementation framework of CP-ABE-HP scheme for outsourced data sharing CP-ABE schemes with tree-based access structure, and it can achieve the Chosen-plaintext Attack security under the standard model. The CP-ABE-HP scheme could be a useful scheme in realizing self-contained data protection in cloud computing. For future work, we will implement an efficient CP-ABE-HP mechanism and apply it to some  specific cloud storage environments A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No.61170088\and Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment \(Grant No. SKLSDE-2013ZX-05 R EFERENCES  1 A.
