INTRODUCTION \nBig data analyses are critical in business and scientific \ndata processing. Analyses over big datasets may depict more \naccurate results regarding Web data, users behavior and \nchallenging scientific researches [1]. They involve the exe-\ncution of many activities, such as: programs to collect and \nextract data for analysis, data cleaning procedures, annota-\ntions, data aggregations, core programs to perform analyses \nand tools to visualize and interpret the results. These activi-\nties are typically organized in a dataflow and may use tradi-\ntional programs for information retrieval, data mining com-\nputational mechanics or novel approaches developed by \nscientists.  \nMany users currently use MapReduce 2] implementa-\ntions  to perform big data analysis in a High Performance \nComputing \(HPC typically clusters the framework provides data paral-\nlelism. Hadoop† is a very popular open source implementa-\ntion of MapReduce. However, it does not provide features to \n n* Work partially funded by CNPq, CAPES, FAPERJ and INRIA \n\(SwfP2Pcloud and Hoscar projects for P. Val-\nduriez www.ibc-montpellier.fr http://hadoop.apache.org/ \nmodel complex dataflows [3]. Dataflows are commonplace \nin both business analytics and scientific experimentation, \nwhere they are typically called scientific workflows. \nOne approach to develop dataflows for big data analysis \nis Pig Latin [3], which combines MapReduce and SQL \nprogramming styles and provides native operations to load, \nprocess, filter, group, and store data in Hadoop. Pig, the nimplementation of Pig Latin, considers the optimization of \nthe dataflow logic [4] including the optimized placement of \nfilter operations, as well as collapsing two filters into a \nsingle Map operation. These optimizations are suitable for \nthe native Pig Latin operations \(like filter and group user \(that can be a scientist or a business \nuser nUser Defined Functions \(UDF  dis-\npatching and resource allocation, Pig relies on Hadoop to \nhandle MapReduce tasks. Unfortunately, the Hadoop execu-\ntion plan does not take advantage of the declarative features \nof Pig Latin, providing little room for dataflow runtime \noptimization. There are several efforts aiming at improving \nHadoop performance 6–8]. However, they focus on im-\nproving the way Hadoop works, changing the way data is \nstored and accessed and tuning Hadoop parameters. Since \nHadoop is not aware of the entire dataflow and the history \nof executions, it cannot optimize the execution, by taking \nadvantage of data movements and task execution behavior. \nWe believe that concepts from well-established distrib-\nuted query optimization in Relational Database Manage-\nment Systems \(RDBMS  knowledge re-\ngarding the behavior and implementation of relational alge-\nbra operators, as well as database statistics. This knowledge \nallows for the RDBMS to know how a given operation con-\nsumes and produces data thus making it possible to create \nequivalent query execution plans and estimate the cardinali-\nty of intermediate results. Then, based on a cost function, \nthe RDBMS can pick the best plan and adjust it at runtime. \nCompared with RDBMS, current dataflow processing \napproaches lack information regarding the behavior of the \nactivities they are executing and the statistics of their execu-\ntion. For the execution statistics we can benefit from data \nprovenance techniques for scientific workflows [10]. Sever-\nal studies [11–14] point to the importance of bringing prov-\nenance to MapReduce execution frameworks. Provenance, \nas long as it is available for querying during runtime, allows \nfor the analysis of partial results, thus leveraging the 


dynam-\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 150\nic steering of workflows by users [15]. Dynamic steering of \nworkflows is associated to features that allow for changes nand adjustments in the workflow during its execution so the \nworkflow engine dynamically adapts the execution to the \ncurrent configuration or scenario. By steering workflows, \nscientists may change parameters such as filtering criteria \nduring the execution of the workflow, e.g. to reflect better \nresults for the experiments 16]. Based on provenance, it is \nalso possible to estimate the execution time of an activity, \nthe amount of data produced by a Map function or the ag-\ngregation factor of a Reduce function, for example. Prior to ndataflow execution, Hadoop cannot know whether the Map \nfunction programmed by the user always produces a single \noutput for each input or several outputs for each input. This \nlack of data statistics typically yields dataflows with a static \nexecution strategy.  \nTo tackle this lack of data statistics, some approaches n[17] use static code analysis to optimize the dataflow based \non the behavior of the activities. Other approaches require \nthe development of the dataflow through a well defined API \n[18] so the knowledge over data behavior is captured by the \ninterpreter. Both approaches may be the best options for \napplications such as text searching or novel web mining \napproaches that use recently developed Java code that can \nbe easily used as an UDF. \nIn this paper, we discuss how algebraic workflows may \nsupport big data analysis enabling more flexible execution \napproaches through provenance data. Our workflow algebra \n[19] is inspired by the relational algebra for databases and \nprovides a uniform dataflow representation that adds \nmetadata to dataflow activities that leverage data statistics. \nIn the algebraic approach, data processed by activities is nmodeled as relations while activities are mapped to algebra-\nic operators. This approach is suitable for big data work-\nflows \(e.g.  bioinformatics ones [20,21] and oil and gas \n[19,22 brings many opportu-\nnities for workflow optimization through algebraic trans-\nformations and leverages the management of data parallel-\nism through different execution strategies. Furthermore, the \nexecution model for the workflow algebra is tightly coupled \nto the provenance database, enabling real-time provenance. \nQuerying provenance at runtime allows for adaptive sched-\nuling based on provenance statistics [21] and other features nsuch as user steering [16]. Such features avoid a black-box \nexecution and may produce faster and more efficient work-\nflows. We show performance comparisons between differ-\nent execution strategies and different execution plans for the \nsame workflow, obtained through algebraic optimizations. \nOur experimental evaluation shows up to 19.6% of perfor-\nmance improvements. In addition, our experiments show up \nto 39.1% of time saved on a user steering scenario. \nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces \nour approach with a motivating example. Section III briefly \ndescribes the algebraic approach for data-centric workflows, \nits execution model and real-time provenance. Section IV \npresents our experimental evaluation and Section V con-\ncludes. \nII. MOTIVATING EXAMPLE \nTo illustrate how a workflow for big data analysis can be \nmodeled using our algebra [19], a dataflow that searches for \ntrends in scientific publications was chosen. This dataflow nis called BuzzFlow, and it uses data collected from bibliog-\nraphy databases such as DBLP‡ and PubMed§, to show \ntrends and their correlations in the published papers during \nthe last 20 years. BuzzFlow is an example of a general big \ndata analysis dataflow and will be consistently used in the \nremainder of the paper as proof of concept. \n \nFigure 1. BuzzFlow dataflow \nBuzzFlow is composed of 13 activities as shown in Fig-\nure 1. The boxes represent the activities of the workflow and \nthe arrows represent the datasets that flow between them nActivity 1 splits the input file into fragments to enable paral-\nlel processing of the dataset. Activity 2 produces a list of \nwords and its frequency on the year, i.e. it produces a set of \noutput data that contains the year, the word and its frequen-\ncy. Activity 3 aggregates the frequency value for each year \nand word Activity 4 removes every year before 1992. Then, \nactivity 5 aggregates the output relation by Word and writes, \nin a history file, the frequency that the word had on every \nyear since 1992. Activity 5 also stores the total frequency of \nthe word to be sorted in descending order by activity 6. For \neach word in the results, activity 7 creates a histogram of the \ndata contained in the history file, plotting the frequency of nthe word along the years. The results obtained so far follows \na Zipf distribution. Thus, activity 8 selects the interesting \ninformation based on the Zipf’s law and decides whether a \ngiven input tuple should continue in the dataflow or not. \nActivity 9 selects ten of the most frequent terms on recent \nyears \(2011 and 2012 The activity selects the history file \nof those terms produced in activity 5. Next, activity 10 \n n‡ http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/ \n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ \n

Indicators of debate were equivocal from \n1981 to 1995, but uniformly present thereafter. By comparing \nthe tables, we observe main differences between the two \nfields: the extent pattern shows that the field of RF \nmetamaterials initially has a smaller community than Tissue \nEngineering, whereas patterns that evaluate Industrial \nInvolvement and Patenting activities show a weaker \ninvolvement of the marketplace actant for RF metamaterials \nTABLE I.PATTERN LEVEL ANALYSIS: TISSUE ENGINEERING \n 1981?85 1986?90 1991?95 1996?00 2001?05 2006?10\nExtent Low Low Mod High High High\nResilience Mod Mod Mod Mod Mod High\nConnectivity Mod High High High High High\nNovelty FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE\nGrowth 0?0.25 0?0.25 0?0.25 0?0.25 0.25?0.5 0?0.25\nIndustry FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\nPatents FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\nMaturity FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE\nSilent Debate FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\nActive Debate TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\nUncertainties FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE  \nTABLE II.

Big Data Architecture Applied to TESS \nThe activities of accessing the system are fully logged by \nTESS. The discussions on the provided forums, \ncommunications over Facebook and Twitters, and online \nchatting are most likely unstructured data. In other words, the \nmajority of data coming from disparate and heterogeneous \nsources are either semi-structured or unstructured; thus \nconventional approaches and tools that were designed to work \nwith large structured data sets simply cannot handle this big \n355 \ndata. New analytic methodologies and frameworks must be nexplored and introduced to the market to help TESS bring \norder to the big data from diverse sources and thus harness the \npower of the big data. By doing so, we can glean the insights \nand values of the application of TESS. \nFig. 4 shows the overall big data architecture used in \nTESS.

TESS Data Collections \nAll students in a high school are invited to use the TESS. \nDepending on the course a student is taking, he/she would \nhave different privileges to access relevant course materials. \nBased on the defined math course sequence, a student is \nallowed to access the materials for all the courses that he/she \nalready completed. Over time, he/she provides more \ncomprehensive feedback information to this study. A variety \nof other research areas might be stimulated. We work with nteachers, administrators, and some volunteer students to \ndevelop numerous sets of questionnaires for students based on \ngroups and grades. As a result, data measuring the learning \nprocess, materials interactions, usage, and outcomes \(e.g., \ntests scores Analytics \nIn general, structural equation modeling \(SEM modeling. This \nstudy mainly focuses on confirmatory modeling to test out our \nhypotheses that are essentially represented in a causal model \n[9-11]. The model fit must be fully tested against the obtained \nmeasurement data. \nBy referring to a variety of SEM-based STEM studies \nconducted by Dauphinee et al. [4], and Leonhard et al. [6], we \nintend to assess study aid, students' attitude, engagement, \npersistence, motivation, and other relevant constructs involved \nin this off-campus process. These latent variables are \nmeasured and computed using the following grouped \nmeasurable variables. \n• Value - a list of questions are used to measure nstudents' attitudes regarding the usefulness, relevance, \nand worth of math and IT through personal nobservations and life. \n• Difficulty - a list of questions are used to measure \nstudents' attitudes toward the difficulty level of Math \nor IT as a subject. \n• Motivation - a list of questions are used to measure nsocietal recognition and respect. \n• Effort - a list of questions are used to measure the \namount of work that a student expends to learn math \nand IT. \n• Study Aid - a list of questions are used to measure the nlearning setting and accessible help: accessibility for \nonline help; easiness of getting the learning subjects; \nappropriateness of learning materials, etc. \n• Cognitive Competence - a list of questions are used nto measure attitudes regarding intellectual knowledge \nand skills when applied to math and IT. \n• Attitude towards Math - a list of measures are used to \ngauge the enjoyment aspect of intrinsic value. \n• Attitude towards IT- a list of measures are used to \ngauge the student's perceptions, state of mind, or \nfeelings toward IT: J have fun using state-of-the-art \nweb technologies; J enjoy the visualization and \ninteractions etc. \n• Inclination toward STEM - a list of questions will be \nused to measure the changes concerning STEM nimprovement: improved percentage of students \nchoosing STEM career, better a variety of testing \nresults etc. \nIn this study, by relying on principal component analysis \n\(PC A analyses, we \ncan analyze how certain factors \(i.e. more visual geometry \nmodels, hands-on programming, or more interactions school students' inclination towards STEM \nas time goes. Similar to the projects we have done before, we nanalyze our approach by asking a variety of questions related \nto the status quo while striving for improvement. \nConsequently, the descriptive version of "rules of thumb" for \nstudents and administrators are developed to improve student \ninclination towards math in particular and STEM in general. \nOf course, the rules of thumb" should be gradually revised \nand enriched and the learning processes will be continuously nimproved. \nA significant detailed discussion on leveraging Web 2.0 \ntechnologies and service science principles to improve and \nenrich education systems can be found in [12]. \nIV. CONCLUSIONS \nAs an ongoing research project, the proposed framework \nrequires tremendous efforts to make this proposed TESS full­\nblown 


operational in practice. The applicability of the \nproposed approach might be also limited due to some nrestricted accessibility for certain groups of students. \nHowever, although this study initially focuses on enriching \nmath education for high school students, it will create a solid \nfoundation for developing an integrated and systematic \n356 \napproach and framework to enrich STEM education in \ngeneral. The proposed approach and framework can then be \napplied for K-12 education on a national basis. The developed \nmodels algorithms, and Web 2.0 based system can also be \nfurther developed and then integrated with evolving in-school \neducation systems for general educational improvement. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work was done with great support and help from the \nNanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics \(NUAA and Service Science Lab, Nanjing, China. \nREFERENCES \n[I] R.

The Hadoop environment was \nconfigured with two clustered nodes in pseudo-distributed \nmode meaning that all of the Hadoop daemons are started in \ntheir own JVM, but all on the same machine. Both the \nstreaming and regular Hadoop applications were \nbenchmarked for comparison to the previous iteration of \nbenchmarking in order to determine what, if any benefit was \ngained in setting up this environment. In this iteration, the \narchitect would be able to see how a Hadoop cluster is \nconfigured and exercise all of the web-based administrative \ninterfaces for managing the various Hadoop processes. The \nfifth and sixth iteration of experiments \(referred to as \nDistributed Mode hereafter nnodes and again with only the Hadoop VMI deployed. The \nHadoop environment was configured with two or three nclustered nodes in distributed mode meaning that all of the \nHadoop daemons are started in their own machines as \ndetermined by the configuration. Similar to the previous \niteration of testing, both the streaming and regular Hadoop \napplication were benchmarked in this phase, allowing the \narchitect to measure the performance of a Hadoop cluster \nand determine the ease with which scalability can be \nachieved. During this testing stage, several benchmarks were \nexecuted with both the default HDFS block size of 64 MB \nand a larger block size of 256 MB to determine the impact \non the performance.  \nA. Standalone Mode \(Iterations 1, 2 and 3 raw execution times for the various dataset file sizes \nwere recorded for each of the executions and the arithmetic \nmean computed for each dataset size and application. Table \n2 shows the mean execution time and percentage \ndegradation in execution time between the Java application \nand each of the Hadoop versions of the application in \nstandalone mode. It is obvious that the standalone Java \napplication performs better especially on larger dataset \nsizes, in comparison to either Hadoop application. However, \nbecause the difference in mean execution time between the \nJava and regular Hadoop application is only approximately \n20 for the largest dataset size, the architect could conclude \nthat it is worthwhile to continue to the next iteration to see if \nthe changes in configuration will result in a performance \nimprovement. The architect would also note that while the \nstreaming Hadoop application has the benefit of requiring \nlittle migration effort its performance degrades to 206% in \nthe worst case. \nB. Pseudo-Distributed Mode \(Iteration 4 raw execution times for the various dataset file sizes \nwere recorded for each of the executions and the arithmetic \nmean computed for each dataset size and application. As \nillustrated in Fig. 1 the standalone Java application performs \nbetter, especially on larger dataset sizes, in comparison to \neither Hadoop application These results are similar to those \nof the previous iteration. However, for this iteration, the \nmean execution time for the regular Hadoop application \n\(2990 seconds nthan three times greater than that of the Java application for \nthe largest dataset size \(917 seconds yet, for the \nsame dataset, the streaming version has degraded even more \nat a factor of 4.7 \(4316 seconds nTo further compare the change it helps to evaluate the \npercentage degradation between both versions of the Hadoop \napplication in changing from standalone to pseudo-\ndistributed mode.

From this, the architect would note that while \nthe pseudo-distributed mode of Hadoop application has the \nbenefit of easily prototyping a multi-node cluster, its \nperformance on the largest dataset lags the Java application nby a significant factor. However, the architect could also \nrationalize this result given the use of HDFS which is \nintended for distributed file systems and is not as efficient on \na single computer. \n \nTABLE II BENCHMARK DEGRADATION FOR HADOOP APPS IN STANDALONE MODE  \n \nDataset Size \(GB Seconds  App \nStandalone \nMode\nJava App vs. \nHadoop App \nStandalone Mode \nJava App vs. Streaming Hadoop App \nStandalone Mode \n0.02 5 10 8 -100 -60 \n2 171 259 535 -51 -206 \n5.2 477 583 1376 -22 -189 \n10.5 917 1099 2473 -20 -109 n73\n  \nFigure 1.

Hadoop cluster with 64 MB HDFS block size \nAs with previous iterations the raw execution times for \nthe various dataset file sizes were recorded for each of the \nexecutions and the arithmetic mean computed for each ndataset size and application. Similar to the last iteration, the \nbaseline Java application continues to perform better, \nespecially on larger dataset sizes, in comparison to either \nHadoop application. With a data set size of 10.5 GB for \ninstance, the mean execution time of the Java application \nwas recorded at 917 seconds as compared to 1539 seconds \nfor the Hadoop application and 4390 seconds for the \nstreaming Hadoop application.  However, for this \nconfiguration the performance of the regular Hadoop \napplication is markedly improved over that measured in \npseudo-distributed mode \(2990 seconds Hadoop in distributed vs. pseudo-\ndistributed mode Table 3 reveals that the improvement \nranges from 13% for the smallest dataset to 49% for the \nlargest. In contrast, the streaming Hadoop application \nperformance differed by a negligible amount, in fact the \nchange appeared instead to be inversely proportional to the ndataset size, ranging from 8% for the smallest to -2% for the \nlargest, implying a slight worsening in distributed mode, but \nwithout additional larger datasets and testing, it is not \npossible to predict if the trend would continue. From this, \nthe architect might note that using HDFS in distributed \nmode vs. the OS file system in pseudo-distributed mode \nappears to have a significant benefit for regular Hadoop \napplications but little impact on the streaming version.  \nTwo node Hadoop cluster with 256 MB HDFS block size \nTable 4 records the measured and computed arithmetic \nmean execution times for each of the application executions \non the various dataset file sizes.  Examining the data for \nboth the streaming and regular Hadoop applications several \nthings are apparent about the 256 MB block size tests. First, \nthe performance of both versions of the Hadoop application \nimproved. Secondly, it is apparent there is a point where the \nperformance is better for a smaller dataset size and block \nsize and then similarly where performance is better for a \nlarger dataset size and block size. That point has been \ncalculated to approximately 280 MB for the streaming napplication whereas for the regular Hadoop application the \ncrossover point is approximately 2 GB. To the architect, this \nrelationship is important to understand because it implies \nthat a single configuration value for the HDFS block size \nmay not be preferred for all dataset sizes. With this \nknowledge, the architect would consider the average dataset \nsize for their environment and adjust the block size \naccordingly. \nIn addition to differences in benchmarks caused by the \ntuning of the HDFS block size parameter, it is worthwhile to \nnote an additional point about one of the configurations. \nTable 5 shows the raw execution times and the computed narithmetic mean execution times for the various dataset file \nsizes for both the baseline Java application data and the two \nnode 256 MB block size cluster configuration.\nTABLE III.

This is significant to the architect \nbecause it the first test which has resulted in measurable \nperformance benefits and it points out that there is a \nrelationship between dataset size, cluster size and execution \ntime. Having compared the effects of HDFS block size and \ndataset size on the application execution time in iteration 5, \niteration 6 


examined one of the scalability aspects of a \nHadoop cloud; the effect that deploying an additional node \nto the cluster had on the application performance. As shown \nin Table 6, the raw execution times for the various dataset \nsizes were recorded for each of the executions and the \narithmetic mean computed for each dataset size and \napplication type.  \nSimilar to the benchmark for the two node cluster with a \n256 MB block size both of the Hadoop applications \noutperform the baseline Java application after the dataset \nsize increases beyond a specific point. This crossover point \noccurs at approximately 2.75 GB for the Hadoop application \nand then later at approximately 7 GB for the streaming \nversion. To the architect, this implies that there is a nminimum dataset size above which, the Hadoop application \nwill outperform the Java application and should be nconsidered when determining the appropriate cluster size for \na given dataset size. Finally, having compared the three \nnode cluster benchmarks, the architect would want to \ndetermine the amount of performance gained by adding the \nthird Hadoop node to the cluster when compared to the two \nnode configuration. Table 7 shows the raw execution times \nand the computed arithmetic mean execution times for the \nvarious dataset file sizes for both Hadoop applications \nexecuting in the two different cluster sizes. \n75\nFrom the data in Table 7 it is clear that the performance \nof the three node cluster is better than that of the two node \ncluster for all dataset sizes and for a given application type. \nUnlike some of the other comparisons, this means the ncomparative benefit of adding an additional node to a cluster \ndoes not appear to be dependent on dataset size and is thus \nmore straight-forward to quantify. Table 8 shows that for \nthe regular Hadoop application adding an additional node \nprovided a range of 29-33% performance gain, while for the \nstreaming version, the gain ranged from 23-32%. It may be \nworth noting that the gains were slightly smaller for the \nsmallest dataset size. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n \nWithin this study we propose that the benchmarked \nexecution times for an application, acting as a proxy for any \ncorporate legacy application, could be used as a means to \ndetermine whether migration to the cloud makes sense.  This \npremise is predicated on the belief that if the amount of ncomputing resources used to complete a routine task can be \nreduced then it logically follows that this reduction in \nresources would result in lower operational costs.  As a \nresult, the demonstration of shorter execution times implies \nthat cost savings may be achieved by migrating a legacy \napplication to the cloud nThis research progressed iteratively through a logical \nsequence of steps that a software architect might follow in \nevaluating whether performance gains could be achieved by \nmigrating a legacy application to a parallel computing \ncloud. If performance gains could not be realized, or if these \ngains were insignificant in nature, the implication becomes \nthat the costs associated with such a migration outweigh any \npotential benefits.  In reviewing the results, iterations 1 \nthrough 3 suggest that executing either the streaming or nregular versions of the Hadoop application offered no \nimprovement on execution times over the baseline Java napplication in standalone mode. \n \n \nTABLE VII.

In the best case scenario for standalone \nmode, the regular Hadoop application on the largest dataset \ntook 20% longer to execute. While that doesn’t represent a \nhuge disparity, overall, that set of experiments didn’t indicate \nthat stopping after iteration 3 would provide measurable \nbenefits based solely on execution times. Examining the \nresults from the experiments of iteration 4, as in the earlier \niterations, neither version of the Hadoop application noutperformed the baseline benchmark of the Java \napplication. Because of the large degradation in execution ntimes of both Hadoop applications, there are no benefits to \nbe gained with respect to execution time Iterations 5 and 6 \ndelivered performance numbers which enabled the \nquantification of benefits from the migration project. With a \ndataset larger than 6.5 GB, even a two node Hadoop cluster \nrunning the non-streaming version of the Hadoop application \ncan match the baseline benchmark of the Java application \nand surpass it with increasing dataset size. However, looking \nback at the results from that benchmark, the 


difference in \nperformance at the largest dataset size is still less than 10%. \nGiven that a sizable difference in performance was the goal, \nas it would make the cost justification easier, a <10% \nperformance gain would not be considered a sizable \ndifference. The performance differences grow sizably for the \nlargest dataset however. Comparing a two node and a three \nnode cluster, the performance of both Hadoop applications nwas improved in the range of 30% by simply deploying and \nconfiguring an additional node to the cluster. With a dataset \nlarger than 2.75 GB, the non-streaming version of the \nHadoop application executing on a three node Hadoop \ncluster can match the baseline benchmark of the Java \napplication and surpass it with increasing dataset size.  This \ndata implies, that if the datasets with which the architect \nneeds to work are large enough \( >7 GB Java application as a \nproxy for a legacy application renders the results of the \naforementioned investigation questionable. Our stated aim \nhowever is an examination of the actual process that a \nsoftware architect might follow in determining whether an \napplication, legacy or otherwise, is a strong candidate for \ncloud deployment.  Within the context of documenting and \nexploring this cost/benefit analysis processes we thusly argue \nthat the underlying language of the application used is \nlargely irrelevant.  This work focuses exclusively on \nmigration evaluation from the perspective of improvements \nin execution times. The data produced within this project \nindicate that the resultant execution times may be used \neffectively to determine whether benefits exist to justify \nmigration to the cloud.   \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] P.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
