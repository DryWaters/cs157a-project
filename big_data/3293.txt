High-resolution Bayes Detection of Dim Moving Point Target in IR Image Sequence Using Probabilistic Data Association Filter  Askar Hamdulla College of Information Science and Engineering Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China askar@xju.edu.cn  Corresponding author Xingke Lian College of Information Science and Engineering Xinjiang University Urumqi, China hanbingdahai@163.com    Abstract Probabilistic data association \(PDA\chnique was found its broad applications in Radar target tracking. In this paper, based on the basic idea of PDA, a bayes-rule based highresolution detection algorithm for dim moving point target in images sequence is presented: derived the formula for computing location-dependent Bayes threshold and posterior association probabilities for every measurement being a true target location And the comparative performance analysis are also given in this paper Keywords- Dim moving point target, IR image sequence probabilistic data association filter, Kalman filter I  I NTRODUCTION  The conventional studies in infrared or visual tracking system are mainly focused on detection and tracking shortrange maneuvering targets with high signal-to-noise ratio SNR\wever, in military or civil applications, the detection and tracking of long-range dim targets with low SNR is a challenging problem, and already became the hot spot of research areas. Since the distance between targets and sensor is very far and targets occur at a priori unknown points in time that they appear like randomly scattered dots on the imaging sensor. In paper [1  w e h a v e pres en t e d a f a s t  m u l t i frame based detection algorithm for that case. For the continuity of the problem solving, in this paper, we develop a single frame target detection algorithm on the basis of paper 1 u r e1 illu strate th e b a si c p r o b l em o f th is p a p e r The answer for the question in Figure1 is definitely yes. The model and processes of high-resolution detection scheme presented in this paper are given in figure2 and figure3 separately. From the outputs of multi-frame detection frontend processor; we can get the possible target location in the next frame by Kalman predictor. Since, the target is very small and with low SNR, there may be lots of measurements of target location in the tracking window \(vicinity area of predicted location, the detec tion process take place there along with predicted one. The one among of them may be true target location. Because, no single measurement available at time k, but instead, a set of candidate observations are available there, so, the conventional Kalman filter cannot deal well with this situation that must be supplemented with some other methods such as PDA introduced in T h e t a s k  of it is to find out a true location of target through data association technology from a set of measurements. PDA is very suitable for this kind of situation and was used widely in many areas such as target tracking in radar         Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China \(No.60507005\nd college research program funded by Department of Ed ucation of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region No.XJEDU2005I04  000\003 Fi g ure 1 Basic p roblem illustration Multi-frame detection scheme Temporal Combining Spatial                     combining through                            all possible motion                                directions Detection resolution is 002 5 5   K  Is it possible to detect the target in single frame K frames of image If yes, then the detection resolution will became 002 1 1 1     Figure 2  Model of high-resolution detection       Estimated track Detections at t=k Predicted location Tracking window at t=k Input frame at t=k t=k-1 t=k-2

From figure7 and figure8, we may see the variance value of Bayes detection with brightness is smaller than that of Bayes detection without brightness obviously, and the number of false targets also obviously reduces. Figure9 and figure10 are target’s real track and estimate track with brightness and without brightness, and high-resolution Bayes detection can track dim point target well V  S UMMARY  In this paper, we apply the probabilistic data association method to dim moving point target detection and tracking area, get some valuable analytical results: derived the formula for computing location-dependent Bayes threshold and posterior association probabilities for every measurement being a target location.

 Conclusion  This paper presents a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the supervised learning information from association rules combining with unsupervised learning method ISODATA in prediction and early warning for flea beetle Semi-supervised learning algorithm takes advantage of virtue of supervised learning with high accuracy rate and unsupervised learning needn't training samples, according to past data successful predicted and early warned for vegetable crop diseases and insect pest flea beetle Semi-supervised learning algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy and effi ciency of prediction and early warning for vegetable crop diseases and insect pest flea beetle. Prediction and ear ly warning for flea beetle commonly depends on the knowledge of plant protection expert in previous. This paper constructed mathematical methods to establish prediction and early warning model have made certain signifi cance and a high accuracy for prediction and early warning Semi-supervised learning algorithm is effective, but the use of plant protection expert knowledge is also lacking In fact, the influential fact ors of the flea beetle number includes environmental factors, such as soil, but the quantitative research of flea beetle breeding environment is still in the rough, whose data including survival reproduction, and other environmental data of flea beetle is one of the research direc tion of the future research  Acknowledgements Project supported by the South China Agricultural University Principal Foundation Projects, China \(No 2007K017  References    Sun Hu.

association mining The Likelihood Ratio Test fails to extract features also belonging to common vocabulary and it makes the extraction dependent on the feature position in the sentence leading to low recall The dBNP and bBNP based methods yield low recall due to the fact that the product features do not occur with the article the in front of them very often The Association Mining approach returns all frequent nouns which decreases precision Our results suggest that the choice of algorithm to use depends on the targeted dataset If it consists of mainly on-topic content the results of Table 10 indicate that the Association Mining algorithm is better suited for this task due to its high recall If the dataset consists of a mixture of onand off-topic content our results suggest that the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm would perform better due to its ability to distinguish and 002lter out the off-topic features For future work we plan to extend the Likelihood Ratio Test methods especially the dBNP based approach by other determiners such as a or this  which should increase the recall of this method Another possibility which we will investigate regards the BNP patterns The current Likelihood Ratio Test approach is not capable of dealing with discontinuous feature phrases for example in 5 the quality of the pictures is great the feature would be picture quality  This problem could be addressed by introducing wildcards in the BNP patterns We will also investigate whether there are any methods in order to calculate an optimal threshold for the candidate feature extraction in order to increase the recall of the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm We plan to investigate whether a deeper linguistic analysis e.g with a dependency parser can improve the feature

a frequency constraint and according to the structure of the dataset These proposals are all based on a global analytical model i.e an interesting approach that needs however to develop complex and speci\036c models As a result they cannot be easily extended to handle complex conjunctions of constraints to incorporate different symbol distributions or different semantics for pattern occurrences To the best of our knowledge no method has been proposed to estimate the number of patterns satisfying a constraint while avoiding to develop a global analytical model Our approach requires only to know how to compute for a given pattern its probability to satisfy the constraint this can be obtained in many situations and it remains ef\036cient in practice by adopting a pattern space sampling scheme 6 Conclusion Using constraints to specify subjective interestingness issues and to support actionable pattern discovery has become popular Constraint-based mining techniques are now well studied for many pattern domains but one of the bottlenecks for using them within Knowledge Discovery processes is the extraction parameter tuning This is especially true in the context of differential mining where domain knowledge is used to provide different datasets to support the search of truly interesting patterns From a user perspective a simple approach would be to get graphics that depict the extraction landscape i.e the number of extracted patterns for many points in the parameter space We developed an ef\036cient technique based on pattern space sampling that provides an estimate on the number of extracted patterns This has been applied to non trivial substring pattern mining tasks and we demonstrated by means of many experiments that the technique is effective It provides reasonable estimates given execution times that enable to probe a large number of points in the parameter space Notice that domain knowledge is also exploited here when selecting the distribution model Future directions of work include to adapt the approach to other pattern domains and to different constraints Another interesting aspect to investigate is the use of more sophisticated sampling schemes e.g that could b e incorporated in the approach when more complex syntactical constraints are handled e.g a grammar to specify the shape of the patterns Acknowledgments This work is partly funded by EU contract IQ FP6-516169 Inductive Queries for Mining Patterns and Models and by the French contract ANR-MDCO14 Bingo2 Knowledge Discovery For and By Inductive Queries We thank Dr Olivier Gandrillon from the Center for Molecular and Cellular Genetics CNRS UMR 5534 who provided the DNA promoter sequences References  J F  Boulicaut L De Raedt and H  M annila e ditors Constraint-Based Mining and Inductive Databases  volume 3848 of LNCS  Springer 2005  C  B resson C K e ime C F a ure Y  Letrillard M  B arbado S San\036lippo N Benhra O Gandrillon and S GoninGiraud Large-scale analysis by SAGE revealed new mechanisms of v-erba oncogene action BMC Genomics  8\(390 2007  L  C ao and C  Z hang Domain-dri v e n actionable kno wledge discovery in the real world In Proceedings PAKDDÕ06 volume 3918 of LNCS  pages 821–830 Springer 2006  G  D ong and J  L i Ef 036cient mining of emer ging patterns discovering trends and differences In Proceedings ACM SIGKDDÕ99  pages 43–52 1999  F  Geerts B  G oethals and J  V  d en Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans on Database Systems  30\(2 2005  U  K eich and P  A  P e vzner  S ubtle motifs de\036ning the limits of motif 036nding algorithms Bioinformatics  18\(10 2002  S  K ramer  L De Raedt and C  Helma M olecular f eature mining in HIV data In Proceedings KDDÕ01  pages 136 143 2001  L  L hote F  Rioult and A  S oulet A v e rage number of frequent closed patterns in bernouilli and markovian databases In Proceedings IEEE ICDMÕ05  pages 713–716 2005  I  M itasiunaite a nd J.-F  B oulicaut Looking for monotonicity properties of a similarity constraint on sequences In Proceedings of ACM SACÕ06 Data Mining  pages 546–552 2006  I Mitasiunaite and J F  Boulicaut Introducing s oftness i nto inductive queries on string databases In Databases and Information Systems IV  pages 117–132 IOS Press 2007  I Mitasiunaite C Rigotti S Schicklin L  M e yniel J F  Boulicaut and O Gandrillon Extracting signature motifs from promoter sets of differentially expressed genes Technical report LIRIS CNRS UMR 5205 INSA Lyon France 2008 23 pages Submitted  G Ramesh W  M aniatty  a nd M J Zaki F easible itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proceedings ACM PODSÕ03  pages 284–295 2003  F  Zelezn  y Ef\036cient sampling in relational feature spaces In Proceedings ILPÕ05  volume 3625 of LNCS  pages 397 413 Springer 2005
