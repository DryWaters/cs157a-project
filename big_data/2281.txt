of an enter prise has long been recognized in data mining community This requires modeling specific association patterns that are both statistically \(based on support and conjidenceJ and semantically \(based on objective utility relating to a given objective that a user wants to achieve or is interested in Howevec we notice that no such a general model has been reponed in the literature Traditional association mining focuses on deriving correlations among a set of items and their association rules like diaper t beer

426 1 Introduction Association mining is an important problem in data min ing Briefly given a historical dataset of an application we derive frequent patterns and association rules from the dataset by using some thresholds, such as a minimum sup port and a minimum confidence Since Agrawal's pioneer work l a lot of research has been conducted on asso ciation mining Major achievements include approaches to improving the efficiency 
of computing the frequent pat terns from large datasets Z 51 approaches to applying con straints to find more interesting patterns 13 11 151 and ap proaches to eliminating irrelevant association rules by mak ing use of some interestingness measures 19 141 Observe that most existing approaches to association mining are itemset-correlation-oriented in the sense that they aim to find out how a set of items are statistically cor related by mining association 
rules of the form Il  I 4 1,+1\(s%,c 1 where s the support of the rule is lhe probability of all items 11  I occurring together and c the conji dence OF the rule is the conditional probability of 1,+1 given the itemset Il  I Both s and 
c are ob tained simply by counting the frequency of the respective itemsets in a given dataset and are greater than or equal to the user-specified minimum support and minimum confi dence respectively Although finding correlations of itemsets like diaper  beer is very important in many situations people may be more interested in finding out how a set of items support a specific objective Obj that they want to achieve by discov 


ering association rules of the form I  I  Obj\(s%,c%,u 2 where s is the probability that all items 11  I together with Obi hold c is the conditional probability of Obi giventheitemset{Il  I,},anduis theufilifyoftherule showing to what degree the pattern I1  I semanti cally supports Obj Due to its focus on an objective and the use of objective utility as key semantic information to measure the usefulness of association patterns we refer to this new type of association mining as Objective-Oriented urility-based Association OOA mining as opposed to tra ditional Ifemset-Correlafiou-Oriented Associafion ICOA mining OOA mining derives patterns that both statistically and semantically support a given objective Obi Informally I  Il _ I is said to stafisfically suppon Obi if the support s and confidence c of the rule 2 are not be low a user-specified minimum support ms and a user specified minimum confidence me respectively And I is said to semanfically suppon Obj if the utility u of the rule 2 is not below a user-specified minimum utility mu As a result all patterns derived in OOA mining must be in teresting to an enterprise since when employed they would increase the expected utility of the enterprise above the user-specified minimum level U  mu Therefore OOA mining has wide applications in many areas where peo ple are looking for objective-centered statistical solutions to achieve their goals For a typical example in business situ ations a manager may use OOA mining to discover the best business strategies by specifying hisiher objective as 223high profit and low risk of loss:\222 Another example is in medi cal field A doctor may use OOA mining to find the best treatments for a disease by specifying an objective 223high effectiveness and low side-effects.\224 The term utility is commonly used to mean \223the quality of being useful\224 and utilities are widely used in decision making processes to express user\222s preferences over deci sion objects towards decision objectives 6 131 In deci sion theory we have the well-known equation 223Decision  probability  utility,\224 which says that a decision object is chosen based on its probability and utility Since associ ation mining can be viewed as a special decision problem where decision objects are patterns we may well have, cor respondingly an equation 223Interestingness of a pattern  probability  utility.\224 This equation further justifies the ne cessity and significance of enhancing traditional probability support and confidence\based association mining with ob jective related utilities Since utilities are subjective, they can be acquired from domain expertdusers We would point out however, that this does not mean we need to acquire a utility for each sin gle item in a dataset As we will see in Section 3 it suffices to obtain utilities only for those items in a dataset which are directly related to the given objective The population of such objective items would be quite small in practical appli cations In this paper we systematically study OOA mining In Section 3 we formally define the concepts of objective support confidence and utility under the frame of OOA mining In Section 4 we develop an algorithm for mining OOA frequent patterns and rules The algorithm is based on Apriori. with an enhancement that handles objective utility Traditional association mining is NP-hard but OOA min ing does not seem to be easier To improve the efficiency of OOA mining we will present a novel strategy for prun ing itemsets based on the support and utility constraints In Section 5 we present some experimental results 2 Related Work The necessity to develop methods for finding specific patterns which can be used to increase business utility has long been recognized by several researchers 7 10 141 To the best of our knowledge, however no work on association mining has been reported in the literature which formally models such patterns that are explicitly relating to a user\222s objective and its utility Our work is related to but different from existing con strained association mining Existing constrained associa tion mining typically represented by the work of Bayardo Agrawal and Gounopolos 31 Han Lakshmanan Ng, Pang and Pei ll 121 and Srikant Agrawal and Vu 15 takes the form S  T where S and T are sets of items and C is a set of constraints on the selection of S and T When T is not empty such kind of association min ing belongs to ICOA mining because no matter what con straints C is. it always derives asociation rules of the form I  I  J1  J where both itemsets I  I and JI  J satisfy C Certainly, OOA mining can use constraints, too Constrained OOA mining takes the form  S  Obj where cob is a set of constraints on the selection of S in terms of the objective Obi Constrained OOA mining always derives OOA rules Another significant difference between existing con strained association mining and OOA mining is that most exisitng work focuses on SQL-style constraints includ ing item selection pattern length set relations c 2 etc uxc\(S min\(S surn\(S mnt\(S and aug\(S where S is an itemset U is a real number, and 0 is   or 2 see I21 for a summary of types of constraints dis cussed in the literature These constraints fall into one of the following four well-defined categories monotone, anti monotone succinct or convertible In OOA mining how ever we introduce objective utility as a key constraint On the one hand an arbitrary\objective and its utility are dif 421 


ficult if not impossible to be formulated using SQL-style constraints On the other hand the utility constraint is nei ther monotone nor anti-monotone nor succinct nor convert ible Therefore no existing constrained association min ing methods are applicable to it In this work we push the utility constraint deep into OOApriori a variant of Apriori to prune candicate patterns in order to efficiently derive all OOA rules We would paint out that although business objectives such as 223high profit and low risk of loss,\224 can be viewed as constraints, such constraints seem to be at a meta-level w.r.t the above mentioned SQL-style constraints Therefore, spe cific mechanisms are required to represent and handle them The proposed OOA mining may then be the first such mech anism Most recently, Wang Zhou and Han I61 and Lin Yao and Louie 8l suggested adding values to association rules The former takes into account the price and quantity of su permaket sales during association mining while the latter tries to attach a value to every item in a dataset and use the added values to rank association rules There are three ma jor differences between their approaches and ours First we do general objective centered mining by explicitly declar ing a user\222s objective and formulating it in a simple uni form way see Section 3 As a result, utilities are assigned only to those items which directly contribute to the objec tive Second we handle both positive and negative utilities whereas they only consider positive values Negative util ity represents punishmenfloss and it is with negative val ues that our utility constraints become neither monotone nor anti-monotone nor succinct nor convertible Third we push the utility constraints into Apriori and use them to prune candidate itemsets Neither of the above two approaches addressed this Finally our work is different from existing research on 223interestingness\224 9 141 which focuses on finding \224inter esting patterns\224 by matching them against a given set of user\222s beliefs Informally a derived association rule is con sidered \224interesting\224 if it conforms to or conflicts with the user\222s beliefs In contrast in OOA mining we measure the interestingness of OOA rules in terms of their probabilities as well as their utilities in supparting the user\222s objective 3 Objective Support Confidence and Utility We assume that readers are familiar with traditional as sociation rule mining especially with the widely used Apri on algorithm Z A dura base or dorase DB is associated with a finite set DB,tt of attributes Each attribute Ai has a finite domain Vi continuous attributes can be discretized using methods such as that in 41 For each U E V A  U is called an irem An itemset or a parrern is a set of items A k-iremser is an itemset with k items DB consists of a fi nite set of recorddtransactions built from DBOtt with each recordbeingaset{Ai vi  A  u,}ofitemswhere Ai  Aj for any i  j We use lDBl to denote the to tal number of records in DB Finally for any itemset I the function count\(I DB returns the number of records in DB that are supersets of I An objective describes anything that we want to achieve or we are interested in In order to discover patterns in a dataset DB that support our objective Obj we need first to formulate Obj in terms of items of DB This can be done by first partitioning DBatt into two disjoint subsets DBatt  DBZy U DBFtbi where each attribute A E DBZy obviously contributes to Obj whereas each A E DBFzb\222 does not For convenience, we refer to attributes in DBZ as objective anribufes Let A be an objective attribute and V its domain For each U E V A  U is called an objective irem or a class of A We use class\(A to denote all classes of A Let 221$3 be a relation symbol such as    etc For each U E V ARv is called an objecrive relation An objective can then be represented by a logic formula over objective relations using the connectives A V or 7 Formally we have Definition 1 An objective Obj over a dataset DB is a dis junctive normal form C1 V  V c rn 2 1 where each Ci is a conjunction D1 A  A D n 2 1 with each Dj being an objective relation or the negation of an objective relation With an objective Obj as formulated above, we can then evaluate against a dataset how a pattern I  Il  I statistically and semantically supports Obj by defining the support confidence and utility of the corresponding rule 11  lm i Obj In OOA mining we say an objective Obj holds in a record T in DB or we say r suppons Obj if Obj is true given T Furthermore for any itemset I  Ti  Im we say I U Obj  Ii  I,,Obj holds in T if both Obj and all I,s are true in T We then extend the function cmnt\(I DB to cuunt\(1 U Obj DB that returns the number of records in DB in which I U Obj holds Definition 2 Let 11  Im i Obj s c%,u he an as sociation rule in OOA mining Then the support and confi dence of the rule are respectively given by count\({Ii  l,,,,Obj},DB  loo lDBl s  3 Let Obj be an objective and A an objective attribute Based on Obj the classes of A can be subjectively clas sified into three disjoint groups dass\(A  class+\(A U class-\(A

classes of A that show positive support for Obj class-\(A of all classes of A that show negative support for Obj and dasso\(A of all classes of A that show neither pos itive nor negative support for Obj Therefore classes in dass+\(A will bring Obj positive utilities, whereas classes in class-\(A bring negative utilities We then associate side-effects which are assigned by experienced domain ex perts The doctor then wants to discover from DB the best treatments with high effectiveness and low side-effects Apparently, this is a typical objective-oriented utility-based mining problem UA 6 c u;\(r  A=u\200C,AA="\(u Eclo8s DE each class A  v in class+\(A or class-\(A with a utility UA a real number\Since any class in classo\(A can be considered as a special positive class with a utility 0 we can merge classo\(A into the positive group Therefore in the sequel we always assume that any class A  v belongs to either class+\(A or class-\(A The groups of positively and negatively supporting classes of a dataset DB for Obj are then respectively defined as follows class+\(DB  A  v uA E DBzy and A  v E class+\(A and class-\(DB  A  v IA E and A  1 E class-\(A An OOA itemser or OOA pattern is a set A  vl  A  urn of items with A E OB and A  A for any i  j Let I be an OOA itemset and T a record in DB with I T Let C be the set of classes in T The positive utility u:\(I resp negative utility u;\(l of T for I is the sum of the utilities of all positively \(resp negatively\supporting classes in C given by u:\(r  c uA=v 5 A="\200C.hA DE effectiveness I side-effect 5 getting much better 4 very serious 4 eettine better 3 serious vet tolerable Table 1 A I 3 9 4 4 11 12 13 14 5 15 16 The positive and negative utility of DB for I are then I  U 7 edical dataset DB1 4 4 4 3 1 4 1 4 4 3 L 3 noobviouseffect 2 alittle 2 getting worse 1 normal 1 getting much worse Table 2 Degrees of the effectiveness and side-effects 429

is that this requirement is sufficiently performance oriented to meet the requirements for old installations according to the 1987 NEW Requires draw-out circuit breakers to be inserted and removed while in the open position and that if the design permits the control circuits be rendered inoperative while breakers are being inserted and removed stated in the Rules and requests that existing installations not be required to be modified to meet NESC APPA recommends that Section u 4 i which includes requirements for enclosing electric conductors and equipment to minimize unauthorized access to such equipment be modified to refer to only those areas which are accessible to the public Requires conductive fences around substations to be grounded Power Generation v Addresses guarding of energized parts  Fences screens, partitions or walls This section provides additional requirements and related work practices for power generating plants  Entrances locked or attended Special Conditions w  Warning signs posted  Live parts greater than 150 volts to be guarded or isolated by location or be insulated  Enclosures are to be according to the 1987 NESC Sections llOA and 124A1 and in 1993 NESC  Requires guarding of live parts except during an operation and maintenance function when guards are removed barriers must be installed to prevent employees in the area from contacting exposed live parts Requires employees who do not work regularly at the substation to report their presence Requires information to be communicated to employees during job briefings in accordance with Section \(c of the Rules Comments U APPA and EEI provide comments as follows Both believe that some older substations \(and power plants would not meet NESC as This paragraph proposes special conditions that are encountered during electric power generation, transmission and distribution work including the following Capacitors  Requires individual units in a rack to be short circuited and the rack grounded  Require lines with capacitors connected to be short circuited before being considered deenergized Current transformer secondaries may not be opened while energized and must be bridged if the CT circuit is opened Series street lighting circuits with open circuit voltages greater than 600 volts must be worked in accordance with Section q\or t and the series loop may be opened only after the source transformer is deenergized and isolated or after the loop is bridged to avoid open circuit condition Sufficient artificial light must be provided where insufficient naturals illumination is present to enable employee to work safely A2-17 


US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
