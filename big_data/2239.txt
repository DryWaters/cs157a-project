INTRODUCTION \nObservations of the Sun in the 1940s showed that the Sun’s \ncorona is several hundred times hotter than the photosphere. \nIn the 1960s, it was discovered that the corona \nsupersonically expands into interplanetary space as the solar \nwind. While much research into the mechanisms of coronal \nheating and solar wind acceleration has been conducted, \nunderstanding of these two phenomena is incomplete; we \nstill do not understand why the corona is so hot or how the \nsolar wind is accelerated.  This is mainly due to a lack of in \nsitu observations in the region where these phenomena \noccur – the outer reaches of the corona. [1] \nA mission to explore the near-Sun environment was first \nproposed in October 1958 by the Physics of Particles and \nFields in Space Committee of the National Research \nCouncil Space Studies Board [2], also known as the n“Simpson Committee”. This group proposed a number of \nmissions for space exploration, all of which except for a \nmission to explore the near-Sun environment have been \nexecuted.  \nConcepts for a near-Sun explorer were developed as early as \n1962, however, limitations in available technology, \nparticularly in heat shield materials, precluded the execution \nof these concepts. Advances in heat shield technology in the \n1970s allowed NASA to consider a close flyby of the Sun at \nabout 4 solar radii \(Rs and \nsolar wind. The first definition of Solar Probe mission \nscience was developed in 1978 at a workshop held at the Jet \nPropulsion Laboratory \(JPL  implementation of a \nSolar Probe mission has changed over the decades since the \nfirst conception. Figure 1 4] shows the evolution of the \nimplementation of Solar Probe configuration from the 1982 \nJPL concept through a mission as conceived in 2005 by The \nJohns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory \n\(JHU/APL mid-2007, NASA asked JHU/APL to consider another \nconcept for Solar Probe that would perform the science nobjectives of the 2005 concept, implemented as a non-\nnuclear powered spacecraft. The resulting mission is called \nSolar Probe Plus \(SPP November 2011, \nand with Preliminary Design Review planned for January \n2014. \nThis paper presents an overview of the Solar Probe Plus \nmission definition. We begin with a discussion of the \nscience objectives and the implementation of a set of \nscience investigations to complete those objectives. We next \ndescribe the implementation of the SPP mission and \ntechnology development underway to accomplish the \nmission. Finally, we present future work to be done to \ncomplete the current formulation phase. \n \n \n \n \n  2 \n \n \n2. SOLAR PROBE PLUS SCIENCE  \nScience Objectives \nThe Solar Probe Plus mission targets the fundamental \nprocesses and dynamics that characterize the Sun’s corona \nand outwardly expanding solar wind. At times of lower \nsolar activity, the solar wind is bimodal, consisting of a \ndominant quasi-steady high-speed wind that originates in 


nopen-field polar coronal holes and a variable, low-speed \nwind that originates around the equatorial streamer belt. As \nsolar activity increases, this orderly bimodal configuration \nof the corona and the solar wind breaks down, the polar \nholes shrink, and streamers appear at higher and higher \nheliographic latitudes. At these times, the bimodal wind \nstructure is replaced by a complex mixture of fast flows \nfrom smaller coronal holes and transients, embedded in a \nslow-to-moderate-speed wind from all latitudes. The energy \nthat heats the corona and drives the \nwind derives from photospheric \nmotions and is channeled, stored, \nand dissipated by the magnetic fields \nthat emerge from the photosphere \nand structure the coronal plasma. \nSeveral fundamental plasma \nphysical processes - waves and \ninstabilities, magnetic reconnection, \nturbulence operating on a vast \nrange of spatial and temporal scales \nare believed to play a role in coronal \nheating and solar wind acceleration. \nSPP travels much closer to the Sun \n\(9.5 RS from the Sun’s center spacecraft to repeatedly \nobtain in-situ and remotely sensed \ncoronal magnetic field and plasma \nobservations in the region of the Sun \nthat generates the solar wind and \nultimately creates space weather. \nThe approximately seven-year prime \nmission lifetime permits \nobservations to be made over a significant portion 60 accomplished in any \nother way, will allow testing of and discrimination among a \nbroad range of theories and models that describe the Sun’s \ncoronal magnetic field and the heating and acceleration of \nthe solar wind and energetic particle acceleration.  \nThe primary science objective of the Solar Probe Plus \nmission is to determine the structure and dynamics of \nthe Sun’s coronal magnetic field and to understand how \nthe corona and solar wind are heated and accelerated \nand how energetic particles are produced and their \ndistributions evolve.  \nIn order to develop the scientific knowledge needed to \ncharacterize the inner heliosphere, the SPP mission has \ndefined three overarching science objectives.  These \nobjectives with their associated fundamental questions are \nas follows: \n1. Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the \nsolar corona and solar wind. \n1a. How is energy from the lower solar atmosphere \ntransferred to, and dissipated in the corona and solar \nwind? \n1b. What processes shape the non-equilibrium velocity \ndistribution observed throughout the heliosphere? \n1c. How do the processes in the corona affect the \nproperties of the solar wind in the heliosphere? \n2. Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and \nmagnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind.  \n \n \nFigure 1a. The evolution of Solar Probe concepts, 1982-2005 \n \nFigure 1b. The evolution of Solar Probe Plus concepts, \n2008-2011 \n  3 \n2a. How does the magnetic field in the solar wind nsource regions connect to the photosphere and the \nheliosphere? \n2b. Are the sources of the solar wind steady or \nintermittent? \n2c. How do the observed structures in the corona \nevolve into the solar wind? \n3. Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport \nenergetic particles. \n3a. What are the roles of shocks reconnection, waves, \nand turbulence in the acceleration of energetic \nparticles? \n3b. What are the source populations and physical \nconditions necessary for energetic particle acceleration? \n3c. How are energetic particles transported in the \ncorona and heliosphere? \nScience Investigations \nIn October 2010, NASA selected five science investigations \nto address the SPP science objectives. These investigations \nare a combination of in situ electric and magnetic field \nmeasurements, measurements of the solar wind and \nenergetic protons and electrons produced by the Sun, and \nremote sensing of structure in the corona through white light \nimaging nThe FIELDS investigation is led by Stuart Bale of the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley, and is designed to nmeasure solar electric and magnetic fields and their \nvariation in the near-Sun region. Instrumentation includes \nfour electric field whip antennas mounted near the Thermal \nProtection System \(TPS magnetometers on a \nboom to the rear of the spacecraft behind the TPS, a search \ncoil magnetometer also on the boom, and electronics \nnecessary to process signals and control the sensors. These \nsensors will enable the scientific goals of inferring the \nheating mechanisms of the corona and the solar wind; \ndetermining the structure of the inner heliosphere including \nnarrow jets and streams; and quantifying the effect of the nvariable fields on energetic particle acceleration and \ntransport. \nThe Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun \(ISIS Instrument – Lo \(EPI-Lo EPI-Hi spectrum and pitch-angle distribution of energetic \nelectrons, protons and heavy ions in the innermost part of nthe heliosphere where propagation effects are minimized \nand particle acceleration processes are still in progress. \nThese products will enable the scientific goals of \nunderstanding and quantifying the physical conditions \nnecessary for particle energization, particle transport across \nthe corona, particle acceleration mechanisms on the Sun and \nin the inner heliosphere, and particle propagation processes \nthroughout interplanetary space. \nThe Solar Wind Electrons, Alphas and Protons \(SWEAP Kasper of the Smithsonian \nAstrophysical Observatory, and uses two Solar Probe \nANalyzers \(SPAN-A+, SPAN-B

MISSION IMPLEMENTATION \nMission Design nIn addition to the science requirements discussed above, \nNASA has established a set of driving requirements to \ndefine the mission. These are as follows: \n• Complete at least three orbits with perihelion distance \nof 9.5 Rs from the center of the Sun. \n• Develop a perihelion encounter geometry such that \nthere are perihelion passes visible from Earth to allow \nfor simultaneous Earth-based observations of the Sun to \nsupport SPP observations \n• Achieve minimum perihelion passes within 10 years of \nlaunch \n• Develop a mission with launch readiness date in July, \n2018 \nThe requirements will be accomplished with the Solar Probe \nPlus observatory using a near heliocentric orbit with seven \nVenus gravity assists to progressively lower the perihelion \nfrom 35 Rs to 9.5 Rs over 24 orbits, as shown in Figures 2 \nand 3. After launch in July 2018, the spacecraft will ncomplete the first Venus gravity assist approximately two \nmonths later. First perihelion will occur three months after \nlaunch at a distance of 35 Rs. This trajectory requires high \nlaunch energy \(C3 = 159 km2/s2 and the spacecraft design \nis highly constrained by the launch mass available from \ncurrent launch vehicles nThe final orbit is achieved through a \ntotal of seven Venus gravity assists, \nbut without deep space maneuvers, \nand the first minimum perihelion of \n9.5 Rs will occur in December 2024, \nwith the mission completed in \napproximately 7 years from launch \nwith the third minimum perihelion \nencounter. SPP represents an \nimprovement over previous \nimplementations of Solar Probe in \nthat the observatory spends significant namounts of time in regions near the \nSun; over the mission, SPP spends \nmore than 2000 hours below 30 Rs nabout 1000 hours below 20 Rs, and 27 \nhours below 10 Rs. \nEven though the perihelion is decreasing as Venus gravity \nassists are performed, each orbit is essentially the same, as \nshown in Figure 4: a solar encounter phase inside 54 Rs \n\(0.25 AU cruise/downlink phase \noutside 55 Rs where the primary objective is to downlink \ndata from previous science encounters to Earth. Trajectory \ncorrection maneuvers are also performed in the \ncruise/downlink phase Operations during an orbit are event-\ndriven, and operations in each orbit are similar.  This \nconcept allows for modular operations with pre-defined \nsequences that are consistent through the mission. SPP takes nadvantage of this modular nature of the mission to reduce \nrisk and cost of operations. \nLaunch System \nThe baseline trajectory requires high launch energy; C3 for \nthe trajectory is 159 km2/s2, and preliminary concepts for \nthe spacecraft design led to a launch mass allocation of 610 \nkg \(wet study of possible launch \nsystems was performed, narrowing potential launch vehicle \ncandidates to the Atlas V 551 and Delta IV Heavy. In pre-\nPhase A studies, performance predictions for both vehicles \nrequired a Star-48 BV solid rocket motor-based upper stage \nto achieve the required launch energy. We also initiated \nwith ATK a study of possible enhancements to the Star-48 \nstage that could be implemented to increase the performance \nof the upper stage, and subsequently increasing the launch \nmass allocation for the observatory. Table 1 gives a nsummary of launch mass available for the launch vehicle \nand upper stage options studied. \nThe enhanced STAR-48, ultimately designated the STAR-\n48GXV, uses technology implemented in other solid rocket \nmotors made by ATK to decrease the inert mass of the stage \nand increase the Isp of the solid rocket motor. These nenhancements include \n• Replacement of the titanium motor case with a \ncomposite case. \n \nFigure 3. Solar distance through the SPP timeline \n  5 \n• Optimization of the nozzle design and materials. \n• Substitution of a higher-energy propellant for the \nstandard STAR-48BV propellant. \n• Optimization of motor throat, flex seal 


and igniter \ncomponents. \nInitially, the STAR-48GXV effort was intended for \nperformance enhancement, however changes to the Atlas V \n551 implemented to increase reliability and \nmanufacturability resulted in a reduction of performance. In \nthis new configuration, the Atlas V 551 with the Star-48BV \ncan not lift the full 610 kg observatory mass into the SPP \ntrajectory; with mission unique enhancements of low to \nmedium risk, the Atlas V 551 with the Star-48GXV is \npredicted to be able to launch SPP into the required \ntrajectory. The Delta IV Heavy is expected to exceed the \nperformance requirements when combined with either upper \nstage, however, the cost of the Delta IV may preclude its \nuse. The current baseline launch vehicle is Atlas V 551 with \nmission unique enhancements and the Star-48GXV. \nThe Star-48GXV is a significant departure from the heritage nStar-48BV. APL and ATK have begun a development effort \nto produce a flight-qualified solid rocket motor ready for \nintegration with the launch vehicle and observatory for a \n2018 launch. This effort proceeds in three phases: a proof-\nof-concept motor to be manufactured and tested in Phase B, \ntwo development motors in Phase C, and a qualification \nmotor built along with the flight motor fabrication and test \nin Phase C/D leading to delivery to integration. This \nstepwise development effort is designed to allow subsequent \ndesigns to be informed by the results of previous testing. \nSolar Environment \nSolar Probe Plus will experience extreme environmental \nconditions, especially in solar encounter phases. Conditions \nthat SPP must survive include: \n• Solar illumination that varies from 1 Sun at launch to \n512 Suns at minimum perihelion. \n Energetic protons and electrons, typically in high flux \nconditions associated with solar activity that can ndamage electronics or materials, or disrupt electronics \noperation through single event effects. \n• Intense solar wind plasma of concern for surface \ncharging effects that may damage the observatory or \ndisrupt the local environment, affecting the ability to \naccomplish the science objectives of the mission. \n• High velocity dust impacts on critical surfaces from \nparticles ranging from submicron to several hundred \nmicrons in size traveling with relative velocities as high \nas 300 km/s. \nThese environments have been extensively modeled as the \nmission concept has developed, and the observatory has \nbeen designed to survive each protection methods are \ndiscussed in the next section.  \n \n4. SOLAR PROBE PLUS OBSERVATORY  \nSpacecraft Description \nSolar Probe Plus is a 3-axis stabilized spacecraft designed to \noperate in the near-Sun environment. The spacecraft is 610 \nkg wet at launch and approximately 2.9 m high. Figures 5 \nand 6 show the layout of the spacecraft components and \ninstruments. The four NASA selected instrument suites, \nFIELDS SWEAP, WISPR, and ISIS, are accommodated on \nthe spacecraft, with SWEAP’s SPAN A+, WISPR and ISIS \npackaged on the spacecraft ram side \(spacecraft +x Fields antennas packaged on the truss structure \nassembly near the TPS; FIELDS magnetometers and search \ncoil integrated on the magnetometer boom; and SWEAP’s \nSPC accommodated near the Thermal Protection System \n\(TPS on the truss structure assembly.  More detail of the \nspacecraft design and protection from the solar encounter \nenvironment is found in [5]. \n \n \nFigure 4. Solar Probe Plus orbit configuration \nTable 1.

At aphelion, the arrays are normal to the \nSun; as the spacecraft approaches perihelion, the arrays are \nrotated into the umbra so that the power generated \nthroughout the orbit is approximately constant. At nperihelion, only part of the secondary section is illuminated \nand these cells are operated at near 70 degree incidence \nangle. The umbra/penumbra established by the TPS shape \nforms a region of reduced illumination, and at most the \nsecondary cells are exposed to about 25 equivalent suns. \nEven though solar cell illumination is controlled by the \nposition within the umbra/penumbra, a significant amount \nof heat is developed within the cell stacks. The spacecraft \nuses an active cooling system to keep the solar cells within \noperational temperature limits. Water is pumped through \neach solar array wing, which removes heat from the solar \ncells The large radiators mounted above the spacecraft bus \non the truss structure assembly are used to reject this heat. \nThe spacecraft includes a 0.6m HGA with a 40W RF \nTWTA for Ka-band science data downlink, providing n138kb/s at a spacecraft-Earth distance of 1AU. Attitude \ncontrol is provided by four reaction wheels. A blowdown \nhydrazine propulsion system includes thrusters for deltaV \nmaneuvers and momentum wheel 


desaturation.   \nThe spacecraft bus architecture is given in Figure 7. SPP is \nlargely block redundant with limited cross-strapping. The \nblock redundant components are  \n• Avionics Interfaces \(SpW Router & I/F cards n• IMU Interface & Controller \n• Power Distribution Unit Controller \n• Power System Electronics Controller \n Solar Limb Sensor \n• Propulsion Pressure Transducer \nRedundant components that are cross-strapped to each block \nredundant side include: \n• Electronic Control Units \(for actuator control Star Trackers \n• Transponders \n• X- and Ka-band amplifiers \n• Cooling System pumps \n• Spacecraft heaters \nThe spacecraft uses a three-processor system to ensure fast \nrecovery from a fault in which one processor controls the \nspacecraft and one processor acts as a hot spare even with a \nsingle failed processor. The Avionics Redundancy \nController implements switching between processors and is \nfault tolerant due to internal triple redundancy and majority \nvoted outputs. \n \nFigure 5. Anti-ram facing view of Solar Probe Plus \n \nFigure 6. Ram facing view of Solar Probe Plus \n  7 \nProtecting SPP \nSolar Probe Plus experiences severe environments as ndescribed above, especially during solar encounter, and the \nconsiderations for design are significant Protection of the \nspacecraft in both nominal and fault conditions is \nparamount. The methods used to protect SPP from the solar \nenvironment are summarized below, with a more detailed \ndiscussion found in [5]. \nThe TPS is sized to nearly eliminate the heat flow to the \nspacecraft and instruments while in solar encounter nallowing the majority of SPP to operate in a near standard \nspacecraft thermal environment. Spacecraft components are \npackaged with a 2 degree margin to the actual umbra \nformed by the TPS. Guidance and control will meet a \npointing accuracy well within this margin while under \nwheel control. Wheel desaturation may exceed this pointing \naccuracy, but will still be within the umbra margin. Solar \nLimb Sensors are included in the guidance and control \nsystem to warn of immanent umbra violation; these sensors \nare positioned to see illumination first in the case of a Sun \nviolation. The solar array wings include current and voltage \nsensors to warn of high irradiance or over-temperature. \nSolar cell stacks are designed for high intensity illumination \nand operation at elevated temperature. Cell laydown is being \ndesigned with higher thermal conductivity than in typical \nspacecraft, with the objective to minimize the temperature \ngradient through the stack to the cooled substrate. The solar \narray wings are autonomously controlled such that the heat \nload into the cooling system is minimized for the electrical \npower load. The solar array cooling system is sized to \nprovide additional cooling capacity above that required for \nthe margined power loads. \nThe dust environment and dust impact analysis for the \nobservatory has provided initial protection guidelines for nexposed components, and packaging of critical surfaces \nsuch as the solar arrays minimizes the probability of ndamage.  \nRadiation environments have been developed and analyses \nare nearing completion to provide high fidelity local \nenvironments for individual components, instruments, and \nthe harness to support preliminary design. Worst-case \nproton events have been assessed to evaluate potential star \ntracker outage durations, and analyses of drift rates have \ndefined IMU accuracy requirements to ensure SPP remains \nwithin the umbra during these events. Star tracker algorithm \n \nFigure 7. Solar Probe Plus architecture. \n  8 \nmodifications have been defined to enable earlier tracker \nrecovery following a solar proton event. \nThe spacecraft is designed to be single fault tolerant. Fault \nmanagement is designing for autonomous safing and \nrecovery. Work is in progress to define the telemetry \nrequired to indicate a fault and ensure a low latency \nevaluation and response to any time critical fault. \nThe mission design allows for operation of spacecraft \nsystems in a less severe environment before the minimum \nperihelion encounter. Initial encounters are characterized by \na significant reduction in the maximum illumination on the \nsolar array wings for the encounter \(16 suns instead of 22 nsuns. Also, increases in cooling system load for a given \nsmall change in solar array angle are reduced for encounters \nat 35 Rs versus 9.5 Rs \(2.5% instead of 3.8 response of the spacecraft to \nthe environment prior to experiencing the most severe solar \nencounters. \n \n5 TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT \nWhile much of the observatory components are typical \nspacecraft hardware based in heritage designs, several items \nare new developments or experience new environments. \nKey technology developments for the mission are the TPS, \nsolar arrays, solar array cooling system, Solar Limb Sensor, \nSWEAP SPC and FIELDS electric field antennas. \nTechnology development plans for each item have been \ndeveloped with the plan to demonstrate Technology \nReadiness Level \(TRL PDR nCandidate material testing, coupon testing, and designs of \nthe TPS were conducted prior to and through Phase A. TPS \ntechnology development includes demonstration of \nperformance in the expected thermal environment at closest \nperihelion, and also in the launch environment. In Phase B, \na full-sized TPS prototype is being fabricated for launch \nenvironment testing. Following Phase A thermal testing, a \nsection of the TPS is being fabricated for testing in the 9.5 \nRs thermal environment. This testing includes beginning- \nand end-of-life properties of the optical coating on the front \nface of the TPS. Technology development progress is on 


nschedule to meet TRL 6 demonstration by PDR. \nDuring Phase A, a 1/6 prototype of the cooling system was nfabricated and tested, demonstrating thermal and hydraulic \nperformance over mission worst-case hot and cold nenvironments. A full scale radiator was also built and tested \nto demonstrate structural performance. In Phase B, a full \nscale, 1/2 – cooling system is being fabricated that includes \na full-sized solar array platen, two radiators and pump to \ndemonstrate thermal and hydraulic performance of the full \nsystem. An additional solar array wing and radiator are \nbeing fabricated for structural testing. \nDuring Phase A, a solar cell coupon consisting of four solar \ncell assemblies bonded to a water cooled substrate was nsuccessfully tested to the highest predicted steady-state \nirradiance in vacuum. In Phase B, a full-sized secondary \nsection is being fabricated, including a flight-like water-\ncooled platen and flight-like solar cell assemblies. \nTechnology demonstration will include high-temperature, \nhigh-irradiance testing, along with other solar cell \ncharacterization tests that are continuing from Phase A.  \nThe Solar Limb Sensors are an extension of existing \ntechnology, however, the operating environment is different \nfor SPP with the Solar Limb Sensors operating in a \npenumbra environment. In Phase A, the sensor concept and \nfeasibility were developed. Phase B work includes the \nfabrication and testing of a prototype sensor. \nThe FIELDS investigation includes four electric fields \nantennas that extend well beyond the TPS, and so are \nexposed to the full 512 suns at minimum perihelion. Phase \nA development for these antennas centered around extensive \nmaterials testing for candidate antenna materials, and \nniobium has been selected. In Phase B, truncated lengths of \nthe niobium whip antennas are being fabricated and tested in \nhigh illumination conditions. In addition, a prototype of the \nthermal choke used to isolate the antennas from the truss \nstructure assembly will be fabricated and tested. \nThe SWEAP SPC is a Faraday cup with high flight heritage. \nHowever, SPC also extends beyond the TPS and will be \nexposed to the direct solar environment. As with all Faraday \ncups, the instrument is a series of high voltage and ground \ngrids separated by electrical insulators used to measure the \nenergy of incoming solar wind ions. These grids are \nmounted in an enclosure, and behind the grids is a collector nthat interfaces with a rigid coaxial cable to send low-level \nelectrical signals to a preamplifier protected by the TPS.  \nTechnology demonstration for SPC is considerably more \ncomplicated than for the FIELDS antennas Prototype grids \nand insulators have been built and tested to verify electrical \nand thermal performance in the solar encounter \nenvironment. A prototype rigid coaxial cable assembly has \nbeen built and successfully tested. In Phase B, a \ndemonstration prototype of the instrument is being \nfabricated for testing in the simulated solar environment. \n \n6. CONCLUSION \nSolar Probe Plus is the culmination of decades of planning \nfor a mission to the near-Sun environment. The \nmeasurements made by SPP will be critical for our \nunderstanding of the processes by which the Sun produces \nand accelerates the solar wind and energetic particles, and \nhow the Sun’s corona is heated.   \n \nSPP has successfully completed mission definition \nfollowing Phase A. Midway through Phase B, we anticipate \ncontinuing technology demonstration and preliminary \ndesign, with PDR in January 2014. \n \n  9 \n7.

FROM\nTHE BEST \(p < 0.05 comparisons\nbegin to occur with same frequency and hence the advantages\nof ICE become less pronounced.\nFor our synthetic random-walk dataset ICE again generally\nprovided the best performance - but this time the results could\nnot be con?rmed to a statistically signi?cant level, even for\nlarger symbol sets. Note that in general the synthetic data\nprovided an easier task, with almost all methods performing\nbetter than for the real world energy data when quantizing\nto the same number of symbols. A potential explanation is\nthat the nature of the random walk means that the time series\nare more spread out in the space11, and hence it is easier to\ndiscriminate between time series in general. This results in\nless re?ned symbolizations \(with respect to comparisons closing the gap on the ICE quantizer\nas shown in the results. Finally, note that in this dataset the\nsymbol distributions for the time series are Gaussian, and this\nhelps promote the effectiveness of qSax.\nIt is worth also noting that aMSE \(which used the same core\nsimulated annealing algorithm as ICE, varying only the cost\nfunction chosen value of 900 for\nthe approximation of the continuous space in the GPU methods\nwas of an appropriate granularity. A ?nal observation is with\nregard to the poor performance of the MOE and Uniform\nquantizers Their consistent losses, and general inability to\nidentify the majority of nearest neighbours correctly, serve to\nhighlight that the consideration of quantization approach can\nbe vital to the effectiveness of data mining algorithms.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nMany quantization techniques which are thought of as\noptimal, are in fact only optimal within the context of a speci?c\nproblem domain such as signal reconstruction. In this work we\nhave shown that in the extremely prevalent case where quan-\ntized input is used as the basis for time-series comparisons,\nstandard approaches can lead to potential performance loss. To\naddress this issue we have presented a novel quantizer \(ICE computationally tractable implementation\neffective to large data. Our empirical results based upon three\ndifferent datasets \(and using various time-series lengths and\nsymbol-set cardinalities initial evidence for the\nsuperiority of ICE for comparison-based data mining tasks.\nEven though one might expect the assumptions that underpins\nICE to be violated by many real-world datasets, our results\nhave indicated that even when such violations occur our\nquantizer can still provide superior performance to current\nstate-of-the-art quantization approaches.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was funded by the RCUK Horizon Digital\nEconomy Research Hub grant, EP/G065802/1.\n11The variance in the pairwise distances between the original time series\nin the random walk dataset was over double that of the electricity dataset.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
