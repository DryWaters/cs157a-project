The motivation for this \nstudy is the development of a client/server big data file transport \nprotocol for tablet-class client machines that rely on the Java \nRemote Method Invocation \(RMI stream-based; block-\noriented; tablet machines; client/server configuration. \nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe transport of big data sets across distributed \nclient/server systems is an area of growing demand in all \nfields of information processing. Over the years, \nnumerous big data transport utilities have been developed \nto quench the voracious demands in area such as genomics \nand cancer research [1, 2], high-energy particle physics \n[3 and GIS analysis [4] to name a few. \nToday’s big data file transfer utilities are designed to \nsupport concurrent streams of either a single striped file or \nmultiple individual files, whose parallel send/receive nclient-server strategies are the basis for the increase in big \ndata throughput performance. The GridFTP File Transfer \nProtocol [5] is one such example of a high-throughput \ndata transfer utility. GridFTP is characterized by a fast file \ntransfer protocol that supports large files, secure file \ntransfers capabilities for multiple destination points for \nfile transfers, and an API that allows various file transfer ncapabilities. GridFTP is part of the Globus Toolkit. \nGridFTP represents a class of big data transfer tools nthat are designed to make optimal use of hardware \nparallelism on both the client and server sides of a ndistributed cluster system. File transport, in such and \nenvironment, can be organized into parallel file transfer \nstreams. BBFTP [6], BBCP [7] and the Fast Data Transfer \n\(FDT  similar to the GridFTP \nparallel file streaming approach.FDT in particular is \n n1This research is being performed using funding received from the \nDOE Office of Nuclear Energy's Nuclear Energy University Programs.\nwritten in Java that has the capability to run on all major \ncomputer platforms. In addition, FDT uses the Java New \nIO \(NIO  processed in \nblocks-of-bytes rather than the byte-by-byte data stream as \nperformed by standard Java IO. \nThe introduction of tablet-class machines such as the \nApple iPad and Android tablets extends the paradigm of a nclient-server, big data transfer capability that provides fast \ndata transfers between these tablet-class as clients and \nhigh-end server machines. The challenges posed by tablet-\nclass machines are underscored by their limited hardware \nresources: the lack of a disk array storage facility, the \nnumber of communication ports underclocked processors \nto reduce heat production, and flash-based memory that \nare more susceptible to failure. However, one advantage \noffered by off-the-self tablets is processor configuration \nthat supports at least a dual-core processing unit. Although \nlimited, this processor parallelism provides a means to nimplement producer/consumer data transfer strategies. \nThe application of a producer/consumer data transfer ncapability is, however, not the subject of this paper.  \nInstead, the focus here is the design of a data transfer \nutility that can support a tablet-class, client-server \nenvironment for big data transfers nParallel transfer of large striped-data files has been \ndemonstrated with high throughput by utilities such as \nGridFTP and FDT as mentioned before. Unfortunately, \nthese approaches require high-end peripheral hardware to \ncapture, coordinate and merge the multiple concurrent \nstreams of a single large data file that arrives at the client-\nend. Tablet machines are at a significant disadvantage and \nas such a more modest yet robust data transfer strategy is \nrequired. \nThis paper provides a comparative analysis of several \nJava approaches that introduces optimizations to reduce \nthe standard Java IO overhead in filling the socket buffer. \nJava NIO and Zerocopy [10] techniques are described in \nthis paper. A blocked \(buffered presented as an analog to the NIO method. \nIt should be pointed out that Zerocopy requires a Linux or \nUnix OS but that should not be an issue on the server side \nof the network. \nIn the next sections, assumptions regarding the use of \nJava New IO \(NIO the integration of Zerocopy \nand NIO with data transfer timing results provided. \nII. BACKGROUND\nTablet-class client machines represent a collection of \nwindow-oriented technologies for which no unique \noperating system dominates the industry. In such an \nenvironment, the design of a generic client-server data \ntransfer tool 


must rely on programming languages that are \ncompatible on any and all computer platforms.  Java is \none such language that bridges this gap but also provides a \nRemote Method Invocation \(RMI ncoordination between distributed computer platforms \nseamlessly. The RMI mode can be relatively slow since nthe instructions are interpreted.  However, the use of RMI \nas a coordinator of a distributed client-server architecture \nis not a computationally intensive task; for that reason the \napplication of RMI should not incur substantial overhead \ndelays. On the other hand, the internal Java IO stream can \ncertainly lead to TPC/IP overhead delays. \nJava is an object-oriented language that employs a \nbyte-by-byte streaming IO process in preparing the socket \nbuffer for data transfer into the network interface card \n\(NIC destination. At such a fine level \nof data granularity, Java IO is inefficient and does not \nscale well nBlock IO data transfers are a more efficient alternative. \nAs such, Java NIO was developed as a block-oriented \napproach. Java NIO provides the flexibility to adjust the \nIO block size, which can potentially affect the TPC/IP \nbandwidth-delay product \(BDP  nIn addition to Java NIO, an optimized treatment of \ninternal data copying, known as Zerocopy, was developed nand made available in the NIO library.  The next two \nsections will describe the NIO and Zerocopy approaches nThe integration of these two methods forms the basis of \nthe desires tablet client-server big data file transfer \nmechanism. \nA. JAVA NIO \nJava NIO is an open source library developed and \nmaintained by Sun Oracle nblock-wise fashion reduces the software management \nneeds for packetized byte information.  The Channel and nthe Buffer are the principle NIO objects. Channels are \nanalogous to the original Java IO but are bidirectional. In \nthis sense, a channel can be opened for read or for write or \nfor both. Data that is written into a channel must first be \nwritten into a buffer, and data that is read from a channel \nis read into a buffer. A buffer is an object that holds the \ndata that has been read from the channel or holds the data \nthat is to be written into the channel. In the NIO library, \nall data is handled with buffers. The interplay between the \nChannel object and the Buffer object marks the \noperational difference between Java IO and Java NIO.  In \nJava IO, data is written and read directly from Stream \nobjects. NIO allows, therefore, a pipeline between the \nChannel object and the Buffer object to hide access \nlatencies. \nWe give two coding examples of NIO that illustrates \nreading from and writing to a file. A more complete \ndescription of NIO can be found in the introductory \ntutorial [12]. \nReading a file requires three steps. First, a channel is nacquired by creating a FileInputStream using the original \nJava IO library: \nFileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream\( "r.txt  buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate\( buff_Size nfc.read\( buffer that the coding of the \nchannel does not explicitly indicate the amount of data \nthat needs to be read into the buffer.  As a consequence, \nBuffer objects are endowed with an internal accounting \nsystem that keeps track of the amount of data that has \nbeen read and the amount of buffer space remaining for \nadditional data This capability will be useful in our future \nimplementation of a producer/consumer IO strategy. \nThe second example is writing to a file. First, a \nchannel is created: \nFileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream w.txt  nByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate\(buff_Size int i=0; i<message.length; ++i  message[i  buffer the internal accounting \nsystem of the buffer automatically tracks the amount of \ndata written into the buffer and the remaining buffer space \nfor which additional data can still be written. The \nbuffer.put the buffer with data, and the \nbuffer.flip another channel. \nNotice that the allocate parameter can be \ndynamically adjusted to affect TCP/IP performance in \ncombination with algorithms such as Fast TCP [13]. \nNIO supports memory-mapped file IO. This method \nwhen applied to reading and writing file data can greatly \n678 \nimprove channel-based IO as well as the original Java IO. \nMemory-mapping is an OS capability where the \nfilesystem maps portions of a file into portions of the \nmemory on demand.   \nThe following code is an example of how a \nFileChannel nMappedByteBuffer mbb = \nfc.map\(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE, 0, buff_Size  MappedByteBuffer as a \nsubclass of ByteBuffer. Any manipulations using this \nbuffer are automatically mapped to memory on demand \nby the operating system.  \nIt should be pointed out that the Fast Data Transfer \n\(FDT tools is based in part on NIO. \nB. ZEROCOPY \nZerocopy is a stream-based file transfer library that \ndiffers from Java IO in that it reduces the number of \ninternal data copying and associated context switches.  \nFig. 1 


illustrates the Java IO data copying behavior when a \nrequest to send a file from the server to a remote client. \nThe following code represents the data flow encountered \nin Fig. 1: \nFile.read\(fileDesc, buf len socket, buf, len  JAVA IO CONTEXT SWITCHING FROM [10] \nTime Sequence User Context Kernel Context \nBefore Read\nT0  Syscall Read nT1 Before Send\nT3  Syscall Write \nT3 Next Cycle\nWe see in this illustration that the file's data flow \ncopies the file elements into the Read buffer that is then \ncopied into the application buffer then into the Socket nbuffer, and finally into the NIC buffer. In order to handle \nthese internal data transfers, the OS intervenes with a \ncorresponding number of context switches. Table 1 lists \nthe temporal order and number of context switches \nincurred by Java IO. Zerocopy mitigates the number of \ncopying required by Java IO by copying the content of the \nRead buffer directly into the Socket buffer. The \ntransferTo Application \nbuffer and copies the Read buffer directly to the Socket \nbuffer.  UNIX and various flavors of Linux operating \nsystems support transferTo  Rather than \nrelying on the two methods File.read  call: \ntransferTo\(position, count, writableChannel the associated number of context switching is reduced \nfrom four to two.  \nFigure 2.

ZEROCOPY CONTEXT SWITCHING FROM [10] \nTime \nSequence\nUser Context Kernel Context \nBefore transferTo Zerocopy does not rely upon the \napplication buffer to assist in file transfers under the TCP \nprotocol. As a consequence Zerocopy lacks the block-\noriented IO structure required to support parallel file \ntransfers, as does NIO.A closer examination of the \ntransferTo a beginning location of the file to be \ntransferred. This capability can be used to transform \nZerocopy into a block-oriented IO implementation, which \nis referred to as ZeroBuffer. The following code fragment \ndetails the block-oriented ZeroBuffer implementation: \nfc = new FileInputStream\(input  position fc.size position, bufferSize, sc initialized and set to the new \nFileInputStream. Within the while loop, the transferTo with a position indicator that points to \na location within the file, a block bufferSize, and the \nsocket channel descriptor sc.\nThe complete programs for all the file transfer tests are \navailable at [14].\nIV. FILE TRANSFER COMPARISIONS\nTable 3 provides the detail of the Client/Server \nmachine properties. Table 4 summarizes the file transfer \ntimes \(milliseconds byte-by-byte Zerocopy over Java IO. Similar \nresults are reported elsewhere in the literature [10]. The \ntest used file sizes ranging from 0.3MB to 33MB. Each \nfile is run ten times to determine a "best" file transfer time. \nAn average transfer time is not reported since the network \nutilization can distort the significance of average values.  \nNIO and ZeroBuffer are characterized by explicit \nblock \(buffer is \nreferred to as the application buffer. Table 5lists file \ntransfer times measured for Zerocopy, NIO and nZeroBuffer. Although, Zerocopy is independent of the \napplication buffer size its transfer time is listed for each \nbuffer for comparison purposes only. The best NIO and \nZeroBuffer results are listed as a function of their \ncorresponding application buffer sizes, which range from \n1KB to 16MB. The results presented in this paper are for a \n1.03GB file. Other results for smaller files produced \nsimilar results.  \nThe experiments also varied the TCP Send/Recvbuffer \nsizes. The Mac OS X sets the default size of the \nSend/Recvbuffer to 64KB.

NIO, Zerocopy and ZeroBuffer \ndeliver comparable transfer times. There are several items \nto point out. First notices that ZeroBuffer suffers \nnoticeable overheads for small application buffer sizes \n\(1KB to 2KB block-oriented IO structure shows little \ndifference in comparison with Zerocopy. This is quite \nsurprising given the somewhat "artificial" block-oriented \napproach taken. The second item to note is the behavior of nthe NIO method. NIO exhibits file transfer slowdowns for \nsmall application buffer sizes \(1KB to 2KB well as \nfor larger buffer sizes \(2MB to 16MB file transfer \ntime of Zerocopy, between the application buffer sizes \nranging from 4KB to 1MB. \nThe TCP Send/RecvSpace buffer settings are \nconsiderations based on work by several authors \ninvestigating [15, 16 


17] the optimal tuning of TCP file \ntransfers. Starting with the TCP Send/RecvSpace buffer \nsizes of 64KB 156KB, 256KB, 512KB, and 1MB, we \nfound little difference in file transfer performance.  What \nwe observed however, is that the file transfer \nperformance for NIO improves with increasing TCP \nSend/RecvSpace buffer size.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nThe data streaming strategy of Java IO is known to be ninefficient for big data transfers. In this study, block-\noriented IO methods are compared to an efficient non-\nblocked IO method known as Zerocopy. In addition, this \npaper provides the first direct comparison between \nZerocopy and NIO. \nA new block-oriented IO method \(ZeroBuffer supports Zerocopy \nefficiencies over a large range of application and TCP \nbuffer sizes. Although the Zerocopy method can be \nreliably used to address the appetite of tablet-class \nclient/server file transfers, ZeroBuffer has the potential to \nsupport non-blocking, concurrent IO threads, which is an \nimportant feature of high-end grid-IO. \nThis paper represents the initial stages of a much more \nambitious effort to achieve big data transfer rate that can \nsustain the appetite of tablet-class machines in doing \nserious information discovery and analysis. \nREFERENCES\n[1] C.

hybrid storage system where hot\ndata \(performance critical blocks held in conventional HDD [7]. The Hystor\nmaintains a remap area to map addresses and control the data\n?ow. It also keeps a write-back area in SSD to delay the dirty\nblocks of write requests, which is especially bene?cial for\nwrite-intensive workloads. ComboDrive integrates the space\nof SSD and HDD together through maintaining a global\nmapping table from virtual address to physical address [17].\nIn addition, the ComboDrive can select data and ?le to\nbe placed in SSD or HDD. The authors also exploited the\ncombination of SSD and HDD as a hybrid storage system,\nwhere a capacity planner is proposed to ?nd the most cost-\neffective storage con?guration, and a dynamic controller\nis maintained to predict the performance through history\ninformation [12]. However, our current study is distinct from\nthe aforementioned studies in following aspects. First, our\nproposed approach is involved at the beginning phase of\ndesigning the HPC systems. Second, our approach is to\nconduct the deployment of SSDs based on the I/O access\npatterns, not tend to the schedule or organization of data or\nrequests.\n5\n  336\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nFlash-memory based SSDs are promising storage devices\nin the storage hierarchy of HPC systems. In practice, these\nHPC systems come with a ?xed hardware budget. With\na given ?xed hardware budget, how to utilize SSDs to\nmaximize storage access acceleration for current Big Data\napplications is an important issue to be studied. Different\nplacement strategies of SSDs can impact the performance,\nconsidering the factors of I/O access pattern, data movement\nacross the interconnection network and local/global shared\nstorage capacity. In this study, we model the performance\nimpact of placement strategies and propose a pattern-model\nguided approach consisted of workload characterization and\nstrategy mapping to guide the deployment of SSDs to\nmaximize the performance bene?t. The workload characteri-\nzation identi?es the I/O access patterns of applications. The\nstrategy mapping provides the actual deployment strategy\nfor the HPC systems through a performance model and\nquantitative analysis of different deployment strategies. We\nbelieve that appropriate placement of SSDs for HPC systems\nand Big Data applications can be critical and this study\nprovides a possible solution that guides such placement and\ndeployment strategies. In the near future, we will conduct\nmore comprehensive evaluations and with real Big Data\napplications to further evaluate SSD deployment strategies.\nThis study is useful in guiding designs and developments for\nBig Data workloads in current and projected HPC systems\nincluding exascale systems.\nREFERENCES\n[1] N.

The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators.

Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload.

A computational tool has been developed that can\nautomatically enumerate and evaluate thousands of different\nSCaN architectures. This tool contains both a performance\nand a cost model.\nNext Steps\nThe next steps include calibration of the optical link budget\ncalculations, comparisons of the network scheduling calcula-\ntions with historical TDRSS load data, and validation of the\nspacecraft sizing algorithm with real TDRS data. Following\nthe completion of the stakeholder analysis, the tool will be\nbe used to explore the architectural tradespace and identify\na subset of preferred architectures worth studying in more\ndetail.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
