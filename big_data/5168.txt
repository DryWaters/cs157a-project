 Automatic Topic\(s\ Identification from Learning material: An Ontological Approach   Sonal Jain/ Assistant Professor  GLS Institute of Computer Technology Ahmedabad, India sonalsethia@rediffmail.com  Dr. Jyoti Pareek/ Reader  Department of Computer Science Rollwala computer center Gujarat University Ahmedabad, India drjyotipareek@yahoo.com  Abstract   The ability to judge the relevance of topics and related sources in inform ation-rich environments is a key to success when scanning online learning environments. A Learner may be looking for learning materials explaining given topic or exercises on the topic. Any learning material may cover multiple topics related to multiple subject domains. This paper presents ontological approach for identifying major topics covered in the learning mat erial. Along with the topics the subject and discipline to which those topics belongs to and relevance of the topic in the learning material as compared to other topics pr esent in the same document are also discovered. Domain ontology is developed to retrieve the topics covered in the document. We present an evaluation against a manually categorized topics as well as author’s judgment of relevance of the topics discovered by our system. Eval uation results show that the technique presented by us is effective in identifying topics and subtopics covered in a single learning document.  This work is part of research conducted on developing a web service for automatic semantic annotation of learning material Keywords-Topic identification, ontology, semantic annotation I   I NTRODUCTION  With energetic development of the Internet, especially the web page interaction technology, online learning object repositories have become more and more realistic and popular in the past ten years. The reach of Internet to student community has increased its acceptability. Learning object repositories are essentially storage and retrieval systems for learning objects where the learning objects are organized so as to be easily searchable. These repositories enable sharing and reuse of learning materials by different users. Different learners have different requirements and therefore require different learning contents. One of the key issues in using learning objects is their identification by search engines. This is usually facilitated by assigning descriptive metadata to the learning object. These learning object metadata is stored along with learning objects in learning object repository. This information background is needed for querying services to perform accurate queries for learning object retrieval. The work presented in this paper is part of Development of web service for automatic semantic annotation of learning material. With respect to personalization and adaptability in learning systems, we have identified certain essential metadata elements and topic\(s\entification is one of them. A learning material may contain topics and terms related to multiple subjects and domains. Thus topic\(s\ identification along with subject and relevance of each topic will assist in effective search and recommendation for a learner for a personalized learning management system. A topic refers to a particular subject that is discussed about in a piece of text It is th e common theme that semantically links together pieces of text that may be physically di sconn d en tif icat ion of topics covered in the document and subject domain of important terms covered in the document will help in meaningful and need based retrieval of document by a learner. Researchers have indicated that automatic metadata generation is more efficient, less costly, and more consistent than human-oriented processing        T h is  paper showcases our work of automatic retrieval of topics subtopics and relevance of each topic. We view learning material as explanation of concepts. In the first section, this paper discusses related work done by researchers in topic identification. In the later sections our approach is discussed followed by evaluation, results and conclusion II  R ELATED WORK  Researchers have tried to generate topics from different sources of information like research papers, news articles multiparty dialogues etc. Majority of them are focused on collection of material from various sources and identifying topics from them to categorize them. Most of the approachs of topic identification are based on natural language processing for named entity extraction, association rule data mining us t e ri ng o f  as s o ci at i on ru l e s 10], t opi c  keyword clusters using the k-nearest neighbor graph and the keyword clustering function [11 an d in f o r m atio n retrie v a l techniques.

word distribution under same auth  Wor d n e t an d Latent Semantic Indexing based model for dimension reduction has been proposed by Václav Snášel et. al Kino Coursey et. al. has presented an unsupervised system for automatic topic identification, which relies on a biased graph centrality algorithm applied on a graph built from Wikipedi  III  OUR APPRAOCH  Our observation of learning material states that it can cover concepts belonging to multiple subjects/topics/areas For example, a document related to Computer Science subject may contain certain concepts which in turn are related with the Mathematics, Statistics or Management Numerous learning objects thus may belong to multiple disciplines and in turn multiple subjects. The novelty of our tool is that we have tried to identify concepts belonging to different topic or subject areas in same document.  With each identified topic and concepts covered under it, we have reported its relevance as compared to other topics present in the same document with the help of subject domain ontology. This identification will prove helpful to intelligent learning systems while presenting learning documents to learner according to his need s. For example, learning material explaining six sigma concepts will be related to Total Quality Management,  as well as Statistics as Six Sigma concept is based on Standard Deviation. A  student will not able to comprehend Six Sigma concept till he understands Standard Deviation. Thus Intelligent learning management system should make learner alert of the relation between concepts related to multiple subject areas Similarly learning object explaining Deadlock detection will discuss about cycle in a graph which actually in detail will be enclosed under data structures subject. An intelligent eLearning system can search learning materials corresponding to the topics and its relevance extracted by our tool, \(supplemented as part of metadata\d can present its suggestion to a learner   Figure 1  Topic Extraction Our approach of Topic extraction employs a multistage process, first it identifies key concepts within a document and then these terms are compared with terms present in domain ontology. In the next stage, topics/subtopics from domain ontology containing one or more terms as siblings are listed out. Finally the subjects and disciplines, to which retrieved topic belongs to are identified and displayed A  Domain Ontology  Ontology a s p ecif i cat ion of an abs t ract s i m p li f i ed  view of the world that we wish to represent for some purpose. This view is called conceptualization. Therefore ontology defines a set of representational terms that typically include concepts and relations.  The system stores the domain knowledge of various disciplines and their subjects in the form of ontology. The domain ontology is an ontological structure of the topics and terms in a particular subject domain together with the relationships between those topics and terms. Figure 2 gives an overview of created domain ontology with multiple layers    Figure 2  Subject Domain Ontology The top layer contains disciplines like Computer Science Separate ontologies for other disciplines like Mathematics Statistics, Management, Electronics etc are created.  The second layer contains Subjects under that discipline. The third layer contains the broad topics covered under that subject. Topics again can contain sub-topics. These subtopics may be again represented by collection of various terms. We have represented domain ontology using Ontology web language. We developed ontologies in the Protégé Ontology Edito an d u s ed t h e Web O n t o l ogy  Language \(OWL\ to express the ontologies \(Protégé OWL Figure 3 shows the snapshot of protégé editor

 Figure 3  Subject terms as entities in Protégé editor  The development of the domain ontology incurs cost in terms of both time and manual effort. But we have observed that once it is developed, its presence will help in effective and standardized automatic generation of metadata and achieving higher precision level in the retrieval process. The benefits of educational use of ontologies have been identified by many researchers 16  Man y res earch er s  have used these ontologies in various forms and for various purposes. For this study, we have chosen to annotate the learning material belonging to Computer Science discipline We have build domain ontology for four subjects, Operating systems, Database management systems, Data Structures and Statistics. To evaluate the system, ontology corresponding to certain portion of Operations management subject is also developed. The concept and terms required to create domain ontology are identified through three different techniques \(1\manually, through back-of-the-book index of some of the major texts \(2\ through a semi-automatic technique by parsing the Wikipedia pages and \(3 Semantically parsing ebooks  B  Topic Extraction process  This phase skims a document for noun phrases to understand the semantics of the document; we have used Stanford Parser [13 to g r a m m a ticall y  tag t h e con t ent extracted from html document. Some noise like stop words is filtered from the phrases generated. Once list of Noun phrases is finalized, for each generated Noun phrase a vector of formatting features applied on it is created.  If formatting feature is applied on the phrase, then certain weight is assigned to the phrase [18  I n t h e  ne xt st e p  frequency of word and position of word in document are given importance and each noun phrase generated is ranked The lists of the generated keyphrases are displayed for user approval. Figure 4 and 5 shows User interface for the topic extraction tool and Figure 6 shows the list of system generated key phrases ready for user approval.  Input to the system can be either html or docx file   Figure 4  User Interface  Figure 5  Keyphrase Approval from user   Figure 6  Keyphrase comparison with domain ontology entities

These approved key phrases are compared to the terms present in the domain ontologies. Collection of these terms represents certain topic/subtopic of some subject/domain to which it belongs. For each subtopics, topics, subject and discipline are retrieved. OWL Parser is developed to retrieve parent, child and siblings. Input to parser is collection of keyphrases. Parser parses owl file and retrieves topics/subtopics which contains collection of all or some of those keyphrases as siblings. Figure 6 shows the output. It has been observed while testing that most of the learning materials cover or use concepts from various subjects and domains. Thus it is important at this stage to figure out the topics which actually characterize the document. The relevance of document with respect to topic\(s\ /subtopic\(s enclosed in the learning material is calculated as Total number of its key terms identified under the topic/subtopic divided by Total number of key terms identified in the entire document. Document can be characterized using the topic with higher relevance. Figure 7 shows topics/subtopics and its relevance in the document  Figure 7  Relevance of topic with respect to document content IV  E VALUATION R ELEVANT VS   E XTRACTED TOPICS  In this study, we have randomly collected sample of 200 learning material belonging to different subjects like Operating systems, Database management systems, Data and File structures, Statistics and Total quality management The documents were processed by our tool and topics/subtopics along with their corresponding subject domains and significance pertaining to the document were extracted.  Evaluation of this study was done in two phases In first phase subject experts were asked to list down the topics/subtopic\(s\ covered in the document. These topics/subtopic\(s\ were then compared with system generated output. Topics and subtopics exactly matching partially matching and topics/subtopics that are not found are then counted. The result of the counting is as shown in figure 8   Figure 8  Evaluation Results The measure used to evaluate the results was the F-score defined as    In this study, the main concern is that, how many of the suggested topics/subtopics are correct \(precision\d how many of the manually assigned topics/subtopics are retrieved \(recall\. As the proportion of correctly suggested topics is considered equally important as the amount of total topics extracted by the system was assigned the value 1 thus giving precision and recall equal weights  Precision = Number of topic\(s\/subtopic\(s\ identified correctly by the system / Total topic\(s\btopic\(s generated by the system  Recall is calculated as Number of topic\(s\/subtopic\(s identified correctly by the system / Number of topic\(s\/subtopic\(s\ iden tified by the authors  The results are shown in the next section. In the second phase, agreement of authors was sought for the topic\(s\/subtopic\(s\ that were found by the system but were not listed out by authors in the first phase of evaluation Average topics/subtopics extracted by the system is 6.05 while the average topics/subtopics per document listed by subject experts is 3.76.  Figure 9 shows the agree/disagree listing of the topics/subtopics extra found by the tool   Figure 9  Sample result of second phase of evalution V  R ESULTS  We have evaluated our tool in two ways viz., Strict and Lenient. In strict evaluation, while calculating total number of topics/subtopics identified correctly by the system, we are considering partially matched topics/subtopics as topics/subtopics not found. In lenient evaluation, we are considering partially matched topics/subtopics as fully matched topics/subtopics. Ta ble 1 shows precision, recall and F-score in both the evaluations T ABLE 1  E VALUATION R ESULTS  Strict Evaluation Precision Recall F-score 0.5057541 0.8015656 0.63  
361 


Lenient Evaluation Precision Recall F-score 0.6273393 0.9609625 0.76 In the evaluation of second phase, it was found that in 82.3% cases authors have agreed with the system generated topics/subtopics which they missed out while listing down the topics VI  CONCLUSION  Thus, this paper showcases that ontological approach to identify topics from the learning document is an effective strategy. Precision and Recall of our results proves the effectiveness of the tool. Second phase of the evaluation also signifies that at times author is not able to identify the topics or a subtopic from a document if its coverage or relevance is very less in the document. But the system can identify those topics. Identification of the topic relevance can be used as a metadata which can prove useful in presenting the learning documen ts according to the needs of the learner by intelligent learning management systems R EFERENCES   1  E  H o v y a n d  C  L i n   A u t o m a t e d T e x t S u m m a r i z a t i o n i n  SUMMARIST”, in Mani and Maybury \(eds\, Advances in Automatic Text Summarization  MIT Press, 1999  2 G S a l t on  J  A C   B u c k l e y A S i n g h a l   A u t o m a t i c An a l ys i s  t h e m e  generation and summarization of machine readable texts”, Science, 264 pp. 1421-1426, 1994  3 o a  X  C a r d in a e ls  K  M e i r e, M  Du va l, E F r a m ew o r k s for the  Automatic Indexation of Learning Management Systems Content into Learning Object Repositories.

with the Alignment and NQueens benchmarks Results are similar with both versions Although a deeper analysis will be needed the results suggest two main hypothesis 017 The Intel Compiler does not implement thread switching and thus untied tasks cannot bene\002t from this feature which should avoid imbalances This is particularly evident in the Alignment benchmark which has been reported to scale 017 Task scheduling constraints do not seem to impact signi\002cantly the performance results at most there is a 4 difference between the versions The other applications show a similar behavior D Other opportunities for analysis The Intel Compiler does not implement mechanisms that allow the user choose among different task scheduling policies but other OpenMP compilers e 16 that have such capabilities One interesting study is to 002nd how task scheduling policies and how they can mantain locality across tasks can affect the performance results of the benchmarks of the suite In previous sections we have discussed how implementing a cut-off mechanism can affect application performance but we have not discussed due to space limitations how the different cut-off values i.e at which point in the recursion we cut relate with the creation of parallelism and the overall performance Choosing a low cut-off value can restrict parallelism opportunities but choosing a high cut-off value can saturate the system with a large amount of tasks which have no thread available to execute them The right choice depends many times of the input data set Comparing the application behaviour using different cut-off values or testing runtime features which allow to modify dynamically the cut-off can also be interesting analyses The quality of implementations for different task generation schemes e.g in the SparseLU benchmark which can use a single or multiple generator scheme taskwait constructs or other task related implementation details could also be analyzed with our benchmark suite proposal V C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE WORK We have presented BOTS  Barcelona OpenMP Task Suite  built with the double motivation of coping with the great characteristics of the multicore processors and offer a set of benchmarks to evaluate OpenMP tasking We think that BOTS will help implementors and programmers to have a better understanding of the OpenMP tasking model and its performance implications Each of these benchmarks comes also with different versions to test different aspects of the tasking model For example they can be used to evaluate task scheduling alternatives tiedness   Also a number of input sets are provided so that benchmarks can be used as tests or really stress the processors and memory system in your machine It is interesting to note that we have tried to select benchmarks with diverse characteristics In this paper we have highlighted the differences and we have shown their evaluation on an SGI Altix machine with up to 32 processors and we report some of their characteristics per task e.g operations memory writes    Their evaluation also shows that there is plenty of work to do at all levels  architecture compiler runtime system programming model to improve certain benchmarks given that their current scalability is very limited This suite can be used to obtain useful data of the strenghts and weaknesses of an OpenMP implementation that can help developers to improve it Currently we are working to add new benchmarks to the suite to cover more problem domains and scenarios We are as well planning to do a full cross-vendor evaluation to 002nd which is the current state of the OpenMP tasking implementations A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation contracts no TIN2007-60625 and CSD2007-00050 the European Commission in the context of the SARC project contract no 27648 the HiPEAC Network of Excellence contract no IST-004408 the IBM CAS Program and the Mare Incognito project under the BSC-IBM collaboration agreement R EFERENCES  O ARB OpenMP Applicati on Program Interf ace v  3.0  May 2008  J M Bull Measuring Synchronizati on and Scheduling Ov er heads in OpenMP in First European Workshop on OpenMP  September 1999  LLNL OpenMP Performance Suite Description 2001 A v ailable https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/RTS Report/openmp perf.html  A Dorta C Rodriguez F  de Sande and A Gonzalez The OpenMP Source Code Repository Euromicro Conference on Parallel Distributed and Network-Based Processing  vol 0 pp 244–250 2005  C Bienia S K umar  J P  Singh and K Li The P ARSEC Benchmark Suite Characterization and Architectural Implications in Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques  2008 pp 72–81  H Jin M Frumkin and J Y an The OpenMP Implementation of NAS Parallel Benchmarks and Its Performance NASA Ames Research Center Technical Report NAS-99-011 1999 A v ailable citeseer.ist.psu.edu/408248.html
