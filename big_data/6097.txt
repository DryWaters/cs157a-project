Abstract 
 Big Data is a huge amount of data that cannot be managed by the traditional data management system. Hadoop 
is a technological answer to Big Data. Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS\ and MapReduce programming model is used for storage and retrieval of the big data. The Tera Bytes size file can be easily stored on the HDFS and can be analyzed with MapReduce. This paper provides introduction to Hadoop HDFS and MapReduce for storing large number of files and retrieve information from these files. In this paper we present our experimental work done on Hadoop by applying a number of files as input to the system and then analyzing the performance of the Hadoop system. We have studied the 
a m o u nt  of by t e s w r i t t e n an d rea d by t h e s y s t e m  a n d by t h e MapReduce. We have analyzed the behavior of the map method and the reduce method with increasing number of files and the amount of bytes written and read by these tasks

generated is increasing at a very big rate. Computer Engineers at European Council for Nuclear Research CERN\ounced that the CERN Data Centre has recorded over 100 Petabytes of physics data in the last 20 years. Experiment in the Large Hadron Collider \(LHC generated about 75 Petabytes of this data in the last three years. Storing it is a challenge 1 W ith m i l lio n s o f users  Facebook is collecting a lot of data. Everything is interesting in some context. So it is useful to take advantage of this data t orag e of th i s a m oun t o f dat a i s dif f i c u lt  
but distributed storage system provides an efficient scheme for management of this data. Distributed storage system can be used for storing this huge amount of data. There is lots of a distributed storage system currently available. There can be three states of the data. Data can be in structured form semi structured form and unstructured form. The amount of structured data is very less as compared to the semi structured and the unstructured data. Internet Data Center IDC\ has given statistics of the amount of structured and unstructured data present scenario and the predicted growth of the structured and the semi structured data. There are 3V

What if the number of files increased which is to be handled by the Hadoop distributed file system  Graph 1: IDC Estimates [4  A distributed system should have access transparency location transparency, concurrency transparency, failure transparency, heterogeneity scalability, replication transparency, migration transparency; it should support finegrained distribution of data tolerance for network partitioning it should provide a Distributed file system 
service for handling files. The main aim of a distributed file system \(DFS\ to allow users of physically distributed Computers to share data and storage resources by using a common file system. DFS consists of multiple software components that are on multiple computers, but run as a single system. The power of distributed computing can clearly be seen in some of the most ubiquitous of modern applications. So for storage of the Big Data and for better management of the big data we can use the distributed file

system. For finding information from this huge and distributed data parallel processing can be used for big data processing Googleês Map Redu i d es a n e ff ect i v e framework for finding information from this data. Hadoop provides a complete management tool for the management of the big date. Hadoop distributed file system for storage of the data and the MapReduce for the retrieval of the relevant information from this data. It is known that the Hadoop framework works well on large file size. We have analyzed the performance of the Hadoop with small but number of files II H ADOOP HDFS AND M AP R EDUCE  Hadoop comes with its default distributed file system which is Hadoop distributed file system s t ores f i l e in bl ocks  of 64 MB. It can store files of varying size from 100MB to GB, TB. Hadoop architecture contains the Name node, data nodes, secondary name node, Task tracker and job tracker Name node maintained the Me tadata information about the block stored in the Hadoop distributed file system. Files are stored in blocks in a distributed manner. The Secondary name node does the work of maintaining the validity of the Name Node and updating the Name Node Information time to time. Data node actually stores the data. The Job Tracker actually receives the job from the user and split it into parts Job Tracker then assigns these split jobs to the Task Tracker. Task Tracker runs on the Data node they fetch the data from the data node and execute the task. They continuously talk to the Job Tracker. Job Tracker coordinates the job submitted by the user. Task Tracker has fixed number of the slots for running the tasks. The Job tracker selects the Task Tracker which has the free available slots. It is useful to choose the Task Tracker on the same rack where the data is stored this is known as rack awareness. With this inter rack bandwidth can be saved Figure 2 shows the arrangement of the different component of Hadoop on a single node. In this arrangement all the component Name Node, Secondary Name Node, Data Node, Job Tracker, and Task Tracker are on the same system. The User submits its job in the form of MapReduce task. The data Node and the Task Tracker are on the same system so that the best speed for the read and write can be achieved  Figure 2 Single Node Architecture of Hadoop   Google has given the MapReduce programming m which is based on the merge sort. It takes a set of input key/value pairs, and produces a set of output key/value pair map \(k1,v1 list\(k2,v2 reduce \(k2,list\(v2 list\(v2 Map when used in the HDFS first maps all the requested file blocks in the HDFS then reduces them according to the required result  Figure3 MapReduce data flow with a single reduce task [10  IV W ORD C OUNT  WordCount is a simple MapReduce allocation. It counts the number of times a word is repeated into a text file of an input set. It imports Path, conf.*, io.*, maped.*, util.* of Hadoop. The Mapper is implemented by a map method; one

 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP  Dell Precision T3500 system is used with, Intel\(R\n\(R CPU W3565 @3.20GHz 3.20GHz, 4GB RAM, 64-bit Platform Ubuntu 12.04 is on it the installation size was 30GB. Installation of Ubuntu is done using the Wubi installer. At Hadoop website Hadoop-1.2.1-bin.tar is available for download. Hadoop is installed on the Linux file system. Single node architecture of Hadoop is used in which all components of the Hadoop are on the same node Hadoop requires JDK for its working. Java OpenJdk is installed on this system using the apt-get command. The running component of the Hadoop can be checked using the jps command the output of the command is shown in Figure 4. We can access the name node at. We can access that interface from http//:localhost:50070  Figure 4 Jps Output For checking the performance of the MapReduce and the copy of the files from the local file system to the HDFS we have used dataset of the lyrics of the English songs. Here we concentrate on the number of files not on the size of the file A Name node has to record the metadata for each file separately in its file system As the number of file increase metadata about the files stored will be increase we had analyzed the behavior of the copy from local to HDFS and the map reduce task running on these files in a single node environment. Number of files are doubled in each operation we start our experiment with 499 files then we doubled this number each time till 7984 files  Table 2 Experimental Output   The performance of the MapReduce task on the basis of the byte written, File bytes read Reduce input records, have been recorded Table 2 shows the output of the experiment Graph 2 shows the scenario of the byte written with respect to the number of files in the Hadoop distributed file system Number of bytes written by the Map Reduce task does not increase with the rate at which the number of files is increasing  
 
line is processed at a time. The input can be strings or a text file. It splits the input into tokens, for separation it takes space as a tokenizer and uses the class String Tokenizer Output is in the form of <<word>, 1>. Different maps generate these key value pairs for example.  For input file having text like Student college workshop Student Lab Table 1 Output of the Mapper     The Reducer for these maps is implemented by the Reduce method. It takes input from all the maps and like in merge sort it combines the output of all the map and produce output as \(< word>, n\ Where n is the number of times the occurrence of that word in the input. The output of the reducer will be like Student>, 2 college>, 1 Lab>, 1 workshop>, 1 V

 Graph 2:  Bytes written  The reason is that when the reduce function reduces the map output it just combines the output of map reduce like in example two time student is saved with only a key value increase by one. The number file bytes read by the MapReduce task have been recorded. Graph 3 shows the behavior of the map reduce task for reading the file bytes read with increasing number of the files  Graph 3 File Bytes Read by Mapreduce Task  The reduced input records by the MapReduce task also have been recorded. Graph 4 shows the Reduce input record with respect to the increasing number of files. These records do not increase with an increase in the number of files. This is because with increases input only the key values are increased by one each time. That result in this type of behavior. There can be similar types of keywords in the record so only there counter in increased and the number of bytes is saved for storage of the similar types of records. Itês also speed up the process of reducing. Reduce uses the byte records efficiently with this increase number of files   Graph 4 Reduced input record Table 2 shows the output of the experiments with respect to the launched map tasks, file bytes read, Bytes read and Map output records. The Map output and the bytes read increase with increasing number of the files. The wordcount Map Reduce task is divided into parts. Then Map analyzes the input files line by line. It t okenizes the file content on the basis of spaces. Map analyzes all words on the basis of this token. Map read the records as proportional to the input files. Map output the records with key values. Map output is also directly proportional to the input files to the map method of the MapReduce task Table 3 Experimental Output   Graph 5 represents that with the increased amount of files MapReducesê Map output record also increase after tokenizing the data on the basis of space in wordcount application

 Graph 5: Bytes Read, Map output records with increased files  VI I MPORTANT A PPLICATION AND SUGGESTIONS  Data is increasing at a very high rate it is important to have a managed and efficient way of dealing with this data. Data is coming from the heterogeneous resources.  Hadoop provides an efficient mean for managing  the Big data. Our work provides an analysis that how the Hadoop can deal with the different and the  number of files. It provides the behavior of  MapReduce architecture  with increasing number of files. We suggest that use of the MapReduce and HDFS for storing this type of data is efficient. Bytes are efficiently written and read  by the MapReduce programs. It can be used for analyzing the output of the files such as, the files generated by the weather sensors which are distributed in the environment, log files of the different systems  VII C ONCLUSION  AND F UTURE WORK  We have analyzed the performance of the map reduce task with the increase number of file s. We have used the word count application of the Mapreduce for this analysis. The output shows that the Bytes wr itten do not increase in the same proportion as compared to the amount of files increase For our next work of study we will establish a cluster of nodes and then analyze the behavior of the Mapreduce task with a number of files.This can be used in analyzing the files generated as logs. It can also be used for analyzing the sensor's output which are the number of files generated by the different sensing devices R EFERENCES 1 h tt p  h o m e  w eb  c e r n  c h a b o u t upd at es  2 01 3 02 c er n da t a c en t r epasses-100-petabytes 2 ht tp   g i g a o m co m  2 0 12  0 8  2 2 f ace bo o k i sco l l e cting y o ur d ata5 0 0terabytes-a-day 3  Je f f r ey De an an d S a n j ay  G h e m aw at M ap Re d u ce  S i m p l i f i e d D a ta  Processing on Large Clustersé, Google, Inc 4  ht t p  r a c o n te ur ne t te c hno l o gy bi g d atao r b ig s tat is t ics  5 d ity a B.
