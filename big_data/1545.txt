Upgrade of the First Level Muon Trigger in the\nEnd-Cap New Small Wheel Region of the ATLAS\nDetector\nYonathan Munwes on behalf of the ATLAS Collaboration.\nAbstract—The luminosity levels foreseen at the LHC after the\n2018 LHC upgrade will tighten the demands on the ATLAS\n?rst level muon trigger system. A ?ner muon selection will be\nrequired to cope with the increased background and to keep the\ntrigger rate for 20GeV/c pTmuons as before The introduction\nof new detectors in the small wheel region of the end-cap muon\nspectrometer will allow to re?ne the current trigger selection,\nallowing to increase the rejection power for tracks not coming\nfrom the interaction point, thus to ?nd candidate muon tracks\nwithin 1 mrad angular resolution and within the 500 ns available\nlatency. The on-detector trigger logic will require a coincidence\nof eight layers of small thin gap chambers detector pads to\ndetermine the trigger regions-of-interest. The charge information\nfrom the detector strips of the selected regions-of-interest will be\nsent to the off-detector trigger logic, which will calculate the strip\ncentroids and extrapolate the muon tracks. The muon tracks\ninformation will be ?nally sent to the end-cap sector logic, which\nwill combine the big wheel and the new small wheel trigger data,\nand provide the trigger muon candidates to the ATLAS central\ntrigger.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTHE ATLAS experiment [1] was designed for a broadphysics programme, including precision measurements\nof the Standard Model \(SM for the Higgs boson,\nSUSY or Exotics new particles accessible at the Large Hadron\nCollider \(LHC particles are discovered, their\nproperties will have to be studied in many cases. These studies\nrequire very large data samples. For that reason, upgrades\nare needed of both the LHC \(to increase the luminosity the ATLAS experiment \(to be able to cope with higher\ncollision rates and radiation background integrated\nluminosity eventually available will also allow access to rare\nprocesses and to higher centre-of-mass energies of colliding\npartons, extending the reach of the searches for heavy new\nparticles.\nThe LHC complex will be upgraded in several phases.\nFollowing the long shutdown of 2013/14 \(LS1 accelerator\nenergy will be increased to close to 7 TeV per beam, and\nthe luminosity will reach or exceed the nominal value of\n1 · 1034 cm?2s?1. Major upgrades are planned starting from\nthe 2018 shutdown with which the LHC luminosity will\nsubstantially exceed the initial design values. At the second\nlong shutdown in 2018 \(LS2 the accelerator luminosity will\nbe increased to 2 to 3·1034 cm?2s?1, allowing the ATLAS\nexperiment to collect 100 fb?1/year. The last upgrade will\nintroduce signi?cant changes to the interaction point \(IP that the luminosity will reach up to 7 · 1034 cm?2s?1\n\b\t\n\f n\f\n\b\t\n\f n\f\n\b\t\n\f n\f\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1.

Upgrades are\nplanned for both the muon and the calorimeter trigger systems,\nwithout which the single lepton triggers would have to be either\npre-scaled or its pT threshold raised, resulting in a signi?cant\nloss of acceptance for many physics processes of interest.\nII. UPGRADE OF THE MUON SPECTROMETER NEW SMALL\nWHEELS\nThe Phase-I upgrade of the ATLAS muon spectrometer [3]\nfocuses on the end-cap region. Figure 2 shows a cut-out of the\nATLAS detector in z-y plane. The barrel and end-cap system\nconsist of three stations each, measuring the muon momentum\nbased on the curvature in the ATLAS toroid magnets.\nAt high luminosity the following two points are of particular\nimportance:\n• The performance of the muon tracking chambers \(in par-\nticular in the end-cap region  extrapolation\nfrom the observed rates at the lower luminosity conditions\nof the 2012 to high luminosity conditions indicates a\nsubstantial degradation of tracking performance, both in\nYonathan Munwes is with Tel Aviv University, Israel\n978-1-4799-1047-2/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE\n\b\t\n\n\f b\b\b\t\n\nFig. 2.

ATLAS detector.\n• The Level-1 muon trigger in the end-cap region is based\non the track segments in the TGC chambers of the middle\nmuon station \(End-cap Muon detector, EM  The TGC of the Small\nWheel is only used as a rough con?rmation that a particle\nhas traversed the end-cap toroid zone. It cannot provide a\nprecise muon trigger as, being a single plane, it cannot\nreconstruct a track segment direction pointing to the interaction\npoint. A signi?cant part of the muon trigger rate in the\nend-caps are fake muons. Low energy particles generated\nfar from the IP and out of time of the triggered bunch\ncrossing produce fake triggers by hitting the end-cap\ntrigger chambers at an angle similar to that of real high\npT muons. An analysis of 2012 data demonstrates that ?\n90% of the muon triggers in the end-caps are fake. As a\nconsequence the rate of Level-1 muon trigger in end-cap\nis 8 to 9 times higher than that in the barrel region.\nBoth of these two issues represent serious limitation on the\nATLAS performance at high luminosity reduced acceptance of\ngood muon tracking, and loss of low pT single muon Level-1\ntriggers.\nIn order to address the two problems, ATLAS proposes to\nreplace the present muon Small Wheels with the ‘New Small\nWheels’ \(NSW The NSW is a set of precision tracking and\ntrigger detectors able to work at high rates with excellent real-\ntime space and time resolution. These detectors can provide\nthe muon Level-1 trigger system with online track segments of\ngood angular resolution to con?rm that muon tracks originate\nfrom the IP. In this way the end-cap fake triggers will be\nTABLE I\nEXPECTED LEVEL-1 RATE AT 3× 1034 CM?2 S?1 FOR DIFFERENT pT\nTHRESHOLD WITH AND WITHOUT NSW.

IMPACT ON PHYSICS PERFORMANCE\nThe importance of having a high ef?ciency Level-1 trigger\nfor inclusive leptons with pT < 20 ? 25GeV has been shown\nin the Higgs boson searches through the WW decay\nin the low Higgs mass range. This situation will become even\nmore crucial for the high luminosity running of the LHC.\nGiven the recent discovery of a new low mass boson, this is\nparticularly true. Large integrated luminosity \(a few 100 fb?1 and fermions using production processes independent of\nthe decay mode, such as Higgsstrahlung from W \(pp WH and\n?+?? ?nal states. Table I shows a comparison of ef?ciency\nand Level-1 rate from a simulation study for the present detector\nand the upgrade with NSW. At the instantaneous luminosity\n3×1034 cm?2s?1, the single muon Level-1 rate of the present\nsystem will become as high as 60 kHz, dominating the allowed\ntotal Level-1 rate of 100 kHz. The Level-1 rate may be reduced\nsigni?cantly by raising the pT threshold to 40GeV, but with\nthe high cost of reduced ef?ciency to the WH production\nchannels. The NSW will allow ATLAS to keep the Level-1\nrate for single muons above 20GeV, at 22 kHz with very\nlimited loss of ef?ciency. The same argument applies also to\nthe ZH associated production.\nLow pT lepton triggers are also important for many SUSY\nsearches where leptons are produced through cascade decays.\nThe kinematic distribution of the ?nal state objects depends\non the mass relation between particles in the cascade as\nwell as the couplings. Any increases in the lepton trigger\nthreshold \(and other objects like jets and EmissT the parameter space of\nSUSY models [2]. Ef?ciency is generally lower with higher\npT threshold, and it is particularly true for the parameter\nspace of small mass difference. Similar situations are found in\nother SUSY processes such as the searches for sleptons and\nelectroweak gauginos.\nIV. MUON SMALL WHEEL DETECTOR REQUIREMENTS FOR\nRUN III\nThe highest counting rates in the muon spectrometer is\nobserved in the Small Wheel region. A large fraction of that is\ndue to low energy photons and neutrons. They are generated\nby synchronous proton collisions with the bunch crossing\nthat triggers the ATLAS data-taking mechanism \(in-time\nbackground or by collisions that happen one to several bunch\ncrossings earlier \(out-of-time background background\nradiation originates from the whole ATLAS detector volume,\nand hence escapes capture by the radiation shielding around the\nbeam pipe and the ATLAS calorimeters. The resulting particles\nare generically referred to as cavern background.\nA. Operating Conditions for Run III\nIn order to predict reliably the expected cavern background\nrates after the various accelerator upgrades, two elements are\nrequired: an accurate measurement of the observed background\nat the current operational conditions and a reliable Monte-\nCarlo extrapolation to higher energy and luminosity. Figure 3\nshows the ratio of the measured hit rates to the corresponding\nsimulation values for the existing muon Monitored Drift Tubes\n\(MDT is in general between 0.5 and 1.4.\nAs a consequence this current background simulation can be\nreliably used to predict counting rates in the muon system for\ndifferent detector geometries and beam energies.\nFig. 3. Ratio of measured to simulated MDT hit rate during a 7 TeV run at\nan average luminosity of 1.9× 1033 cm?2s?1 \(50 ns 


bunch spacing  for the detectors closer to\nthe beam pipe. Direct hit rate measurements using the muon\ndetector have been performed at the current luminosities to\nstudy this dependency. Figure 4 \(a Small Wheel region for MDT and CSCs \(Cathode\nStrip Chambers present end-cap Small Wheel \(since they can cope\nbetter with high radiation environments discontinuity\nat R=210 cm is caused by the different sensitivity of MDT\nand CSC to cavern background particles. The expectation by\nFLUGG [5] simulation is also shown in the same ?gure. The\nmeasured radial dependence reasonably agrees with Monte-\nCarlo predictions. The measured results are then used to\nestimate the background rate on the Small Wheel as a function\nof radial distance from the beams, assuming that the same\ntechnology is used over the full acceptance of the Small Wheel.\nIn Fig. 4 \(b R>210 cm R<200 cm cm?2s?1 . In addition the CSC\ncurve is scaled to have the same value as the MDTs one at their\nboundary to simulate the condition of an all MDT-type detector\nscenario. Similarly, the MDT curve is scaled to simulate the\nall CSC-type detector case. The difference between these two\ncurves indicates a possible dependency of the background hit\nrate on the detector technology. Figure 4 \(b the current MDT system will\noperate near its limits, and well beyond that for a luminosity\nof 7× 1034 cm?2s?1.\nr [cm]\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n]2\nH\nit \nR\nat\ne \n[H\nz/\ncm\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nData \(large sectors n\(a 400 450\nRadius \(cm H\nz/\ncm\n2 b cm?2s?1, ?s=7TeV.\nFig. 4.

Given the small discrepancy between measurements and\nsimulation the measured values have been used for subsequent extrapolation\nto higher luminosities. Figure b  maximum Phase-II luminosity\nof 7 × 1034 cm?2s?1 will be ?14 kHz/cm2 assuming con-\nservatively the MDT sensitivity for the future detector. The\nextrapolation to high luminosities is simple as the rate of\ncavern background is proportional to the beam luminosity.\nThis has been established experimentally by studying hit rates\nand currents in several muon detectors at LHC runs of various\nluminosities. All the above is based on the measurements at\n?\ns=7TeV. The ratio of background rate at\n?\ns=14TeV and\n7 TeV is about 1.3 in the Small Wheel region according to the\nMonte Carlo simulation using FLUGG.\nAny new detector that might be installed in the place of the\ncurrent Small Wheel should be operational for the full life time\nof ATLAS \(and be able to integrate 3000 fb?1 1012hits/cm2 are expected in total in the hottest\nregion of the detector [6].\nThe proposed detectors should be validated for ageing effects\nat a level of about 1Coulomb/cm2 \(or higher equivalent for a wire chamber, and in case\nthe required performance is dif?cult to achieve, the possibility\nof replacing chambers, especially in the very forward region,\nshould be envisaged. The trigger and read-out electronics should\nbe also be validated in the same conditions.\nB. Physics Performance And Precision Tracking\nIt has been shown that the current muon detectors in the\nNSW region cannot operate ef?ciently in the high background\nenvironment expected with the various LHC upgrades. A new\ndetector needs to be built which will give high detection\nand reconstruction ef?ciency, even at the highest particle\n?uxes expected. The performance of the new detector at high\nluminosity should be at least as good as that of the current\ndetector at low luminosity, and be able to measure the transverse\nmomentum \(pT 10% for\n1 TeV muons in the full pseudorapidity1 coverage of the Small\nWheel \(up to ? = 2.7 such a detector should\nhave the following characteristics:\n• Measure hits with a position resolution in the bending\nplane of < 100? m per measurement;\n• Angular resolution of ?0.3mrad;\n• Segment ?nding ef?ciency of more than 97% for muons\nwith pT more than 10GeV \(the segment ?nding ef?ciency\nfor the current MDT system track segment resolution\nof less than 50? m including all alignment and calibration\nerrors;\n• Ef?ciency and resolutions should not degrade at very high\nmomenta \(due to ? rays, showers etc coordinate with a resolution of 1–\n2mm.\nC. Trigger Selection Power\nTrigger simulations show that selecting muons with pT >\n20 at Level-1 \(L1MU20 luminosity of 3 ×\n1034cm?2s?1 of approximately 60 kHz, to be compared to\nthe total allowed Level-1 rate of 100 kHz. Due to the limited\npT resolution of the Level-1 muon trigger system, raising the\n1ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal\ninteraction point \(IP detector, and the z-axis along the\nbeam line. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and 


the\ny-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates \(r azimuthal angle around the beam line. Observables labelled\ntransverse are projected into the xy plane. The pseudorapidity ? is de?ned in\nterms of the polar angle ? as ? = ? ln[tan\(?/2 further improve signi?cantly\nthe signal to noise ratio.\nIn order to reduce the low pT components, the pT resolution\nof the muon Level-1 system needs to be heavily improved. A\nprecision angle measurement at the Small Wheel level can be\nused to improved the pT resolution of the Level-1 trigger in the\nend-cap. In the present layout, the contributing factors to the pT\nresolution are: i Wheel\ntrigger station \(?3mrad 0.5mrad for high pT muons iii 2 to 3mrad for low energy muons and\nconsiderably less than 1mrad for high energy ones corresponds to\n1–2mrad depending on contributions\niii smearing effects to improve the pT\nresolution. To be compatible with the performance of the Big\nWheel, a resolution of 3mrad or better is required for the\ndetermination of the track segment angle \(angle relative to the\npointing direction to the IP probably improve\npart of the Big Wheel trigger resolution to 1mrad. Hence a\nsimilar resolution of 1mrad is required at the level of the Small\nWheel for a detector that will have to perform adequately for\nthe whole lifetime of the ATLAS experiment.\nV. SYSTEM OVERVIEW\nThe NSW system consists of sTGC and micro megas MM magnets. Each\ntechnology is composed of eight detection layers. There are two\nsTGC quadruplets in the outer layers and inside are two MM\nlayers. Although both technologies can provide both trigger\nand precision measurements, the sTGC is the primary trigger\nand the MM are mainly used for precision measurement. The\nNSW trigger system provides candidate muon tracks to the\nTGC Sector Logic which uses them to corroborate trigger\ncandidates from the Big Wheel TGC chambers. The Sector\nLogic then sends Level-1 trigger candidates to the ATLAS\nMuon Central Trigger logic. The radial coordinate of tracks\nfound in the NSW is measured by high precision strips. The\nazimuthal, ? coordinate is determined by the triggering tower\nof NSW pads for sTGC and by small angle stereo strips for the\nMM. A line from the interaction point through the R-? point\nof a track in the NSW is projected onto the Big Wheel’s R-?\narray of Regions-of-Interest \(RoI 7.5mrad\nangle of this line are passed to the Sector Logic which attempts\nto match it to an active RoI in the Big Wheel. Con?rmed hits\nbecome Level-1 candidates sent to the Muon Central Trigger\nInterface.\nIn addition to a precision track coordinate for projection to\nthe Big Wheel, the NSW trigger measures the polar angle of\nthe track inside the Small Wheel, i.e. before the end-cap toroid,\nto an accuracy of <1mrad. This is done by calculating the\ntrack position in two virtual planes within the Small Wheel.\nFor the sTGC these are located on either side of the MM\nchambers separated by about 30 cm \(See Fig. 2 resulting in poorer pointing resolution. For\nsTGC, each of these two radial coordinates is calculated by\naveraging up to four centroids of strip signals from four sTGC\ndetectors. The centroids are calculated by the sum of strip\ncharges weighted by position. Finally, the radial position and\nangle ?, between a track in the NSW and an in?nite momentum\ntrack from the interaction point, are calculated from these two\ncoordinates The azimuthal coordinate, ?, is de?ned by the pad\ntower that triggered the sTGC trigger. For the MM we take\nadvantage of the 0.5mm strip pitch and use the strip address\nof the earliest arriving hit in a given bunch crossing to obtain\nthe radial coordinate with suf?cient resolution in each plane in\norder to calculate the polar angle. The ? coordinate is obtained\nby a lookup table addressed by the strip addresses of two small\nangle stereo views. A stereo angle of just 3? is suf?cient to\ndetermine the ? coordinate with the required precision. The\nangle ? is passed to the Sector Logic, but will not be used\nuntil Phase-II when the New Big Wheel trigger will provide an\nangle of similar accuracy; the two angles can then be used to\ncalculate a much more accurate pT for the Level-1 trigger than\nis currently. For Phase-I the improved pT can be calculated by\nLevel-2 using MDT data.\nThe sTGC NSW trigger logic uses pad tower triggers to\ndrastically reduce the amount of sTGC data to be processed on\neach bunch crossing for the Level-1 trigger Three-out-of-four\ncoincidences are made in pad towers in each sTGC quadruplet;\nthese are then combined to choose a band of strips in each of\nthe eight sTGC layers to be readout to the trigger processors\nin USA152 The details are described in Section VII.\nThere are no plans to use the wires in the sTGC trigger,\nbut they are read out in response to a Level-1 Accept and are\ntherefore available to the Level-2 trigger. Only the outer two\ndetectors of each layer have wire readout. For the inner two,\nthe pad segmentation provides a ?ne enough ? coordinate.\nVI. STGC DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY\nThe basic Small strip Thin Gap Chamber \(sTGC 


shown in Fig. 5[a]. It consists of a grid of 50?m gold plated\ntungsten wires with a 1.8mm pitch, sandwiched between two\ncathode planes at a distance of 1.4mm from the wire plane.\nThe cathode planes are made of a graphite-epoxy mixture with\na typical surface resistivity of 100 k?/ sprayed on a 100?m\nthick G-10 plane behind which there are on one side strips\n\(that run perpendicular to the wires pads\n\(covering large rectangular surfaces side \(see Fig. 5[b the name ’Small TGC’ for t\nhis technology.\nA similar type of structure was used in the past for the OPAL\nPole-Tip calorimeter, where 400 detectors were constructed\nand run for 12 years.\n2The USA15 cavern next to the ATLAS experimental cavern hosts most of\nthe electronics in the experiment and it is accessible during the runs of the\nLHC.\n\(a b crossing, the sTGC trigger electronics ?nds\nlocal tracks that point, with < 1mrad precision, to the Big\nWheel to corroborate its coincidences. In order to place the\ntrack ?nding and extrapolation logic off-detector, we use a 3-\nout-of-4 coincidence of pads in each of the 4-layer quadruplets\nto choose the relevant bands of strips to be sent off-detector.\nThis reduces both the required bandwidth and the amount of\ncentroid and track nding logic. To reduce the number of\npad channels, the layers are staggered by half a pad in both\ndirections to make logical towers one quarter the area of a pad.\nASD\nASD\nTDS\nASD\nASD\nTDS\nASD\nASD\nTDS\nsTGC trigger: strip logic: one layer of one 1/16th\nLL_sTGC_trigger_overview_V08\non-chamber\non-chamber\non-chamber\non rim of small wheel\nPad trigger\n3/4 & 3/4\n64\n64\n64\n64\n64\n64\n64\n64\n64\n64\n64\n64\nTotal:\nstrips\n~1030\nASDs\n18\nTDS’s\n9\nlinks\n3 nInner\nOuter\ncentroid finders\n3 \(for 8 layers finder\nand track\nextrapolator\nBC clock\n8 layers\ncentroid finder\nand track\nextrapolator8 layers\nin USA15\ncentroid finder\nand track\nextrapolator8 layers\nO\nM\nI\nto\nsector logic\n 3 candidates \nper BC\nSelected band: \nOne 125-bit word per BC:\nBCID, bandID, ?-ID, strip charges? 5.0 Gb/sec\nopt\nlnk\nopt\nlnk\nTTC and DCS via GBT\nTTC & Config Distrib\non chamber\nChoose the band of\nstrips under the tower\nsTGC quadruplet\nFig. 6.

Meanwhile the pad coincidence logic\nselects the bands of strips in each layer that pass through the\ntower generating the coincidence.

The number of regions and their\nboundaries that balance the probability of trigger candidates\nwill be optimized with simulations.\nThe IDs of the bands that are selected are distributed to the\nTDS chips. The one in each layer of each region that holds\na selected band transmits the strip charges on a fast serial\ncopper pair to a router on the periphery of the wheel. The data\ntransmitted include the Bunch Crossing ID, band-ID, ? -ID\nand the strip charges. 128 bits must be transmitted in 25 nsec,\nnecessitating a link with 5Gb/sec payload. The Router then\nsends the data from the active TDS ASICs to the centroid\n?nding and track extrapolation logic \(see section VII-3 to compute centroids and then track segments that point\nto the Big Wheel. These candidates are then sent via fast serial\nlinks to the Sector Logic to be combined with Big Wheel\ncandidates. The whole process repeats every bunch crossing\nwith a ?xed latency \(See Table II Pad Trigger And Random Trigger Rates: The pad tower\ntrigger tags a bunch crossing and the band of strips passing\nthrough the triggered tower in each layer that must be selected\nfor readout by the TDS ASIC.

Although this is a fair number of cables, it preserves\nthe exibility of doing the pad tower coincidence logic in\naccessible programmable logic.\n2 Simulation: In order to verify the\nsTGC trigger algorithm and to evaluate its ef?ciencies and\nfake rates at various levels, a fast simulation program has been\ndeveloped. Its main features are:\n• Detector and pad geometry: the exact geometry taken from\nthe parameter book. In particular the pads staggering and\ndisplacement is faithfully reproduced.\n• Magnetic ?eld and multiple scattering: an angle distributed\nwith a Gaussian distribution with ??, ?? = 5, 20mrad\nis conservatively assumed.\n• Incoherent Background: the ? - dependent incoherent rate\nis from Fig. 4, scaled to L = 5× 1034 cm?2s?1.\n• Coherent Background: the ‘standard’ coherent background\nremains to be simulated.\n• Cathode charge distribution: a Gaussian distribution with\n? = 3mm is assumed. The charge is spread in two\ndimensions over the neighbouring pads.\n• Ef?ciency: an ef?ciency of 1 for a charge deposit above\n0.5mip is assumed. For a deposit below 0.2mip the\nef?ciency is null, and increases linearly between these\ntwo values.\nIt should be noted that each of the above features with its\nparameters can be switched on or off and parameterized.

READ-OUT SYSTEM AND DATA-QUALITY\nMONITORING\nThe off-detector readout chain of the ATLAS detec-\ntors presently consists of sub-detector speci?c ReadOut\nDrivers\(RODs ROS ReadOut Links \(ROLs  the S-link protocol [7]. The ROLs cross the boundary\nbetween the sub-detector domains and the TDAQ domain.\nAfter Long Shutdown 3 this organisation will be changed: the\nworking group for de?ning the architecture of the off-detector\nreadout has recommended to split the ROD functionality in\ntwo:\n• The front-end links connecting the detectors to the off-\nchamber readout electronics will be interfaced to a general\npurpose COTS network with a stateless, non-detector-\nspeci?c and high-availability interface.\n• The ROD data processing and other functions will operate\non data delivered by an industry standard network Even-\ntually such a ROD could be implemented in an industry\nstandard PC.\nThe front-end links will be for many subdetectors by CERN\nGBT links [8], which also can, and will, be used for transferring\nTTC, DCS, and front-end con?guration information. In view\nof the handling of DCS traf?c, the interface should be as\nstateless and as ignorant of detector speci?cs as possible, that\nis, its state should not depend on the state of the DAQ system\nand subdetector-speci?c data handling should be avoided. The\ninterface must also be able to generate a BUSY signal when\nits event data buffers become full and to connect to both the\ncurrent and the upgraded Phase-II TTC system.\nThe connectivity of the interface, which is named FELIX\n\(Front End LInk eXchange implemented with FPGAs\nfor interfacing to the GBT links and for formation of data\nstreams that will be routed to server PCs. For event data, these\nPCs will perform the classic ROD functions: fragment building\nand associated error detection, data checking and transformation\nand monitoring. The fragments may be forwarded to server PCs\nimplementing the ROS functionality or alternatively the ROS\nfunctionality can also be implemented in the same server PCs\nas used for fragment building. DCS and front-end con?guration\ninteract with the on-chamber systems via the general purpose\nnetwork and FELIX.\nTwo important advantages of the architecture are: minimiza-\ntion of the amount of special purpose detector-speci?c hardware\nand associated ?rmware and the exibility offered by the use of\ngeneral purpose, industry standard networking and server PCs.\nOn the time scale of installation 40 or 100Gb/s Ethernet \(and\nsimilar speeds for In?niband available\nat reasonable cost, so that the data from 10 to 25 fully utilized\nGBT links can be concentrated on a single network link \(even\nhigher concentration is possible when, as for the NSW, the\nGBT bandwidth is not be fully utilized functionality as needed.\nIf needed, the processing capabilities of these PCs could be\naugmented by GPUs or other types of coprocessors such as the\nIntel Xeon Phi coprocessor [9]. The use of PC technology and\nCOTS network \(for the output to the ROS as well bene?ting\nfrom further evolution of the technology. Testbeam work and\nproduction testing will be possible with less performant network\nand server PC hardware than needed for the ?nal system, but\nthe network protocols and the software can be identical to\nthose to be used in the ?nal system.\nBy adopting FELIX as the NSW off-detector readout, the\nNSW will be Phase-II compatible with respect to functionality4.\nThere are two possible models for FELIX: \(1 to GBT links and one network card, or \(2 system is by means of mezzanines that can be replaced for\nthe Phase-II TTC system. Although the former is less compact,\nits network connection does not require ?rmware development,\nit is more ?exible and is more easily upgradeable. The FPGA\nboards maybe commercial boards or boards developed for other\nprojects such as the ATCA based TELL40 for the LHCb Phase 1\nDAQ upgrade [10], the ALICE C-RORC PCIe board [11], to\nbe used as the new ROBIN [12] for Phase 0 ATLAS DAQ and\nthe GLIB board [13] developed by the CERN GBT project.\nFor initial testing of the FELIX approach in 2013 / 2014, the\nserver PC-plus-PCIe plugin card model will be taken Either\nthe C-RORC, the GLIB board if its PCIe interface can be\nused, or a commercial FPGA PCIe card will be used. NSW\ncollaborators will be part of a wider collaboration designing\nand building the FELIX interface.\nIX CONCLUSION\nThe proposed NSW will allow the ATLAS muon system\nto maintain its full trigger acceptance and its excellent muon\ntracking at the highest LHC luminosities expected. At the same\ntime the Level-1 single muon typically pT > 20GeV requirement for very good segment angle resolution\nof 1mrad at the Level-1 trigger level. This angular 


resolution\nallows for a powerful background rejection in the track density\nNSW environment. It is also an important step towards a further\nimprovement of the muon Level-1 trigger system foreseen in\nthe Phase-II upgrade for even higher luminosity. This Phase-\nII upgrade will substantially improve the pT resolution of\nthe Level-1 muon system. This will be achieved by using\nthe information of precision tracking detector Monitored\nDrift Tubes, MDT per track segment\nprovided by the NSW.\n4Full Phase-II compatibility requires the hardware to be performant enough\nand to support interfacing to a new TTC system.\nThe NSW project consists of R&D of detector technology\nand electronics. The schedule for installation is 2018 at LS2.\nBefore the installation, it is planned that the completed wheels\nare fully tested on surface during 2017 for about one year. In\norder to match such a schedule, the production of the chamber\nmultiplets, which is expected to take < 2 years to complete,\nshould start from 2015. Year 2014 will be devoted to the\nproduction of module-0 and its quali?cation.\nREFERENCES\n[1] ATLAS Collaboration, The ATLAS Experiment at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider JINST 3 \(2008  Experiment, Tech.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
