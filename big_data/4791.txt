science opportunities A planning and scheduling component of the system enables the rover to take advantage of identified science opportunities In this paper we provide a brief overview of the entire OASIS system and then describe new system capabilities with an emphasis on the identification of novel features during a traverse This capability has been integrated into the full system and validated in field testing In addition the system has been integrated with the Visual Target Tracking VTT capability recently uploaded to the Mars Exploration Rovers VTT 
enables the system to robustly track a specified target By integrating this with the autonomous science system the rover can approach targets identified onboard and acquire targeted measurements both from additional viewing angles as well as from positions in close proximity to the target.1 2 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION    1 2 OASIS OVERVIEW

1449 Version 2 Updated December 13 2007 rovers endurance records and more importantly their return of such a rich treasure of in-situ scientific data Spirit has driven 7.26 kilometers 4.51 miles and has returned more than 102,000 images Opportunity see Figure 1 has driven 11.57 kilometers 7.19 miles and has returned more than 94,000 images."3 Should the rovers continue to maintain an acceptable level of productivity and operability through the martian winter the mission could well run into 2009 Now over three and a half years into the mission researchers are beginning 
to seriously consider the possible benefits that elements of autonomous science technology may bring to increasing the mission's science returns While a number of autonomous rover capabilities are currently in development for future in-situ missions onboard autonomous rover science continues to grow in importance as rover lifetime and travel distances increase OASIS 1-4 an Onboard Autonomous Science Investigation System is a JPL-managed project designed to maximize mission science on rover missions with long traverses OASIS is designed to operate onboard a rover identifying and reacting to serendipitous 
science opportunities Science opportunities can include detection of atmospheric events such as dust devils and clouds 4 and terrain features such as rocks with novel properties that the rover has not seen before 1 OASIS analyzes data the rover gathers and then prioritizes the data based on criteria set by the science team At the next opportunity for transmitting data back to Earth the data is already prioritized ensuring that the most valuable data is sent first As OASIS is working to prioritize the data it is also searching 
for specific targets it has been told to find by the science team 1 If one of these targets is found it is identified as a new science opportunity and a science alert is sent to the planning and scheduling component of OASIS After reviewing the rover's current operational status to ensure that it has enough resources to complete its traverse and act on the new science opportunity OASIS changes the command sequence of the rover to gather additional measurements of the target of interest 1 3 1 


The rover is instructed to stop its current traverse locate the rock that triggered the science alert and take additional data e.g color image closer grayscale image spectrometer reading on that rock In addition the system now enables the rover to either turn and collect data on the identified target rock or to drive to the target so that closer measurements can be collected Once it has completed this additional measurement the rover reverts back to its original plan and continues on its traverse classified onboard represent outliers as compared to the rocks that have historically been seen This discovery of the novel rock will also trigger a science alert As resources permit OASIS can instruct the rover to point to this target take some close-up data and then return the data to Earth at its next communication cycle Going beyond searching for targets whose characteristics match those provided by the science team the rover can now search for novel rocks rocks that once analyzed and Figure 1 As of sol 1308 Sept 28 2007 Opportunity's total odometry was 11,572.94 meters 7.19 miles 


The OASIS system includes three primary components In Section 2 we briefly describe the system and these components Section 3 outlines how the novelty detector identifies rocks that are dissimilar from any rocks seen previously How the combined use of OASIS and VTT enables autonomous target selection and rover approach to within 1-2 meters of a target location is outlined in Section 4 Finally related work is in Section 5 and a summary is presented in Section 6 2 OASIS OVERVIEW To assess and subsequently prioritize the scientific value of a set of collected images we must first extract the information found within the images A geologist in the field gets information about a site by identifying geologic features including the albedo texture shape size color and arrangement of rocks and features of the topography such as layers in a cliff face The geologist analyzes and assesses this data and then takes some action based on the analysis such as taking a sample or taking some additional measurement of an interesting rock In order for scientists to allow an autonomous system to help investigate the traversed region the system must be able to perform albeit in a very simple way these same types of functions This system thus is used to point out rocks or other objects of interest to the scientist There are three major components that comprise OASIS  Extract Features from Images Enables extraction of features of interest from collected images of the surrounding terrain This module both locates rocks in the images and extracts rock properties features including shape size texture and albedo  Analyze and Prioritize Data Uses the extracted features to assess the scientific value of the planetary scene and to generate new science objectives that will further contribute to this assessment This module consists of three separate prioritization algorithms that analyze the collected data and prioritize the rocks A new set of observation goals is generated to gather further data on rocks that either conform to the pre-set specifications by the science team or are so novel in comparison to the other rocks that another data measurement may be required Image analysis when used on a sequence of images taken in a stationary position for cloud or dust devil observation campaigns can also be used to identify motion an indication of a cloud moving or a dust devil moving across the field of view 4  Plan and Schedule New Command Sequence Enables dynamic modification of the current rover command sequence or plan to accommodate new science requests from the data analysis and prioritization module A continuous planning approach is used to iteratively adjust the plan as new goals occur while ensuring that resource and other operation constraints are met 3 NOVELTY DETECTION During a rover traverse OASIS acquires Navcam and Hazcam images periodically When an image is acquired it is analyzed to identify rocks in the image and for each rock geologically salient features including albedo size eccentricity and angularity shape and orientation are determined Each rock and its features are added to an onboard database that records the history of the traverse In previous field tests OASIS has utilized its traverse database to select rocks that meet a specific criteria or target signature A target signature is determined by scientists on the ground before or even during a traverse and is uplinked to the rover If a rock or set of rocks is found that meets a target signature e.g smooth with a high albedo the rover will prioritize that rock for downlink or in the case of an extremely high priority target signature attempt to collect additional science measurements While searching for rocks with specific characteristics has been successful in field tests and well received by scientists it has an obvious downside potentially interesting rocks that do not meet the target signature criteria will be missed To address this issue and complement the OASIS target signature capability we have developed and demonstrated onboard novelty detection The OASIS novelty detector identifies rocks that are dissimilar from any rocks seen previously It utilizes the same historical traverse database as our target signature capability However instead of searching for specific rocks as in the target signature case the novelty detector i groups rocks based on feature similarity and then ii searches for statistical outliers from those groups Intuitively this has the effect of identifying and prioritizing for downlink the most novel rocks For example a novelty detector that utilized albedo or VISNIR spectral signature would identify a calcite as novel in a sea of martian basalts It's important to note that our novelty detector operates without any prior knowledge from scientists or operators by design The novelty detector groups rocks based on feature similarity To perform this grouping rock features are treated as points in N-dimensional space and then clustered using the unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm The number of clusters k signifies the number of geologic rock groups a geologist might expect to encounter on a traverse 3 


Figure 2 The top images were acquired one meter apart at the beginning of the traverse The bottom left image is a repeat of the top right with rocks labeled in cyan The novelty detector found one of the dike remnants an upright rock labeled in yellow As a result of the novelty detection OASIS altered the traverse plan to approach the rock and acquire and additional measurement image bottom right before resuming its original traverse For simple novelty detection when operating on only a few rock features and/or on a relatively short traverse it is sufficient to set k to 1 Once the N-dimensional points representing rock features have been clustered into one or more groups statistical outliers are selected by choosing points rocks at least three standard deviations away from the cluster center\(s Rocks that pass this threshold test are considered novel and ranked by their distance from cluster centers i.e the farther away from a cluster center the greater the degree of novelty Figure 2 We demonstrated OASIS novelty detection in the JPL Mars Yard with the FIDO rover shown in Figure 3 on several traverses In the first scenario we turned two basalt rocks upright to represent remnants of weathered and worn dikes The majority of the rocks situated in the yard are longer than they are tall so the two obelisk-like upright rocks appeared to the human-eye to be novel We set the novelty detector to operate on two rock features in our traverse database eccentricity 0.0-1.0 with 0.0 being round and 1.0 represented elongated and orientation 0-180 degrees with respect to the ground As our traverse was short and the number of rock features small we set k to 1 Navcam images were acquired every meter We conducted several independent traverses with these settings In every traverse one or both of the upright rocks were detected and identified as novel by the OASIS novelty detector Figure 2 In a second more limited study we examined Navcam traverse images that contained one to a few high albedo rocks amidst a field of several times as many low albedo rocks This rock configuration was meant to simulate calcites in a sea of martian basalts Since the JPL rovers do not have a spectrometer onboard we relied solely on albedo as an indicator of mineral content To that end the novelty detector was set to operate on rock albedo from the traverse database In every test case the high albedo rock\(s was 4 


detected and identified as novel by the OASIS novelty Figure 3 JPL FIDO rover detector 4 AUTONOMOUS TARGET SELECTION TRACKING AND SAMPLING Previously the OASIS system has been shown to enable autonomous targeting for remote science measurements that cannot be easily selected in advance Remote sensing instruments typically take measurements from a distance and are located on a rover mast such as the MER Panoramic Cameras and Mini-Thermal Emission Spectrometer mini-TES This year OASIS was shown to enable autonomous target selection for targets that require either close-contact or near-proximity measurements Towards this goal the OASIS system was integrated with the MER Visual Target Tracking VTT software 6 which enables a rover to track a selected target as the rover drives and to closely approach a target location The combined use of OASIS and VTT enables autonomous target selection and rover approach to within 1-2 meters of a target location This level of approach already supports close-proximity measurements where the rover must be within a certain number of meters of a target to acquire a good measurement e.g due to occlusions or instrument range Follow-on steps for close-contact sampling would be target handoff to the rover hazard cameras rover base placement to within 1 meter of target and sample acquisition through automated instrument placement Our goal this year was to demonstrate the capabilities for automated target selection and close approach In future years we plan to integrate with the additional technologies required for close-contact measurements which have already been successfully used with VTT to enable single cycle instrument placement SCIP 7,8 Currently the typical mission operations scenario for selecting MER rover targets remote and close-contact is to 1 download image data that has been taken from the rover's current location which is often the end of a drive 2 manually identify targets on Earth using that data and then 3 uplink new measurement commands at the next opportunity which at best will happen on the next sol and may require several sols This strategy is difficult to implement if the rover is driving on most sols as has been the case over large portions of the MER missions since there is limited time to analyze the data and uplink new commands before the rover changes its location Further if the rover is driving on multiple sols between uplinks there is no current way to take targeted measurements at intermediate stopping locations since data on those locations will be downlinked in time This situation becomes more complex if the measurements need to be close-contact or require the rover to be in close proximity to the target Close contact measurements can provide a wealth of science knowledge for planetary environments and are one of the most important elements of a surface mission On the MER rover mission it typically requires a minimum of two to three sols to place an instrument for a close contact measurement Further these measurements can only be collected when the rover can remain at one site for an extended period allowing time for imaging downlink of images to Earth target selection by scientists and uplink/execution of desired measurement sequences New technology has been uploaded to the MER rovers such as VTT and automated instrument placement that can reduce the overall collection time however targets must still typically be selected on Earth using image data that was downlinked from a previous sol To test OASIS technology for automated target selection and handling in conjunction with VTT we have done a large amount of testing with the FIDO rover in the JPL Mars Yard For this testing we employed the integrated system shown in Figure 3 and used the following scenario elements The rover is commanded to drive towards a target location which represents a ground-selected science target As the rover drives images are taken with the rover's navigation cameras of the surrounding area These images are analyzed in an online fashion by the OASIS rockfinder and rocks in the scene are autonomously identified Next a subset of those rocks are selected and prioritized based on scientist-selected criteria For this testing we primarily used the OASIS novelty detector as explained in Section 3 to prioritize potential targets but other target selection techniques could also be used If a highly interesting rock is found it is identified as a new science target and request for a new measurement is sent to the OASIS planning and schedule subsystem Since only a limited amount of time or resources will typically be available on a rover mission to take opportunistic science measurements the OASIS planning and scheduling subsystem is used to only schedule measurements that can be safely executed based on the rover health and current state Planning in OASIS is provided by the CASPER continuous planning system 9,10 An iterative optimization approach is used to schedule additional science measurements within the 5

navigation and pose estimation are provided by the CLARAty functional layer 12 The functional layer uses the D*/Morphin navigator 13 to navigate toward a commanded location The MER VTT algorithm was integrated with D*/Morphin to allow the rover to navigate safely toward a feature of interest At each step of the algorithm the rover acquires an image with the navigation cameras pointed at where it expects the feature to be It searches an area around this looking for a match with the target feature When a match is found it updates its estimate of the 3D location of the feature and updates D*/Morphin with a revised location of where the rover should go D*/Morphin acquires images to build an obstacle map and searches for a path toward this location The rover drives a step along this path typically about 1 meter and repeats the process This continues until the rover reaches a requested standoff distance from the target Upon completion of a drive the functional layer updates the executive on the status of the task indicating whether or not it was successful in reaching the target The executive relays this information to the OASIS planner which updates the plan based on this information If the traverse activity was successful it will then proceed to performing the data collection If the traverse was unsuccessful one or more conflicts will appear in the plan and the planner will have to repair these before it can send the data acquisition activity to the executive Figure 4 shows an example new-measurement goal sent to the system from the onboard science analysis algorithm that has detected a novel rock The figure shows a series of images that were collected by the functional layer as it used VTT to move toward the novel rock along with the final image that was collected 5 RELATED WORK The new currently operational autonomous dust devil and cloud detection capability onboard the MER rovers 4,14 is an early demonstration of benefits that can be achieved with onboard science event detection The Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment ASE 15 has demonstrated the capability of planning and data analysis systems to autonomously coordinate behavior of the EO1 Earth orbiting satellite ASE can also detect and respond to new science events however it uses different detection and analysis algorithms Further since ASE were applied to an orbiter it does not handle issues associated with the uncertainty of surface navigation A number of planning and executive systems have been used for robotic applications and have some similarities to the approach we describe in this paper One approach directed towards rover command generation used a Contingent Planner/Scheduler CPS that was developed to schedule rover science operations using a Contingent Rover Language CRL 16 CRL allows both temporal flexibility and contingency branches in rover command sequences Contingent sequences are produced by the CPS planner and then are interpreted by an executive which executes the final plan by choosing sequence branches based on current rover conditions As compared to OASIS only the executive is onboard the rover planning is a ground-based operation and does not involve re-planning Since only a limited number of contingencies can be anticipated and incorporated into the plan CRL does not provide as much flexibility as OASIS when adjusting the sequence in response to unexpected events The LAAS-CNRS lab robotic control architecture 17 also uses onboard planning and execution to create initial plans and to provide re-planning capabilities However as compared to CASPER the IxTeT planner uses a partial order CSP-based planning approach which can require larger amounts of time for re-planning since a valid plan must be found at every search step Further this system has not addressed the handling of opportunistic science and interacting with an onboard data analysis system 6 SUMMARY There are significant potential benefits to using onboard science for rover missions The practicality of onboard science with current missions has been demonstrated with the automated detection of dust devils on the MER rovers The extended OASIS system has been demonstrated on field test rovers with extensive testing in the JPL Mars Yard In addition to identification of the signatures of features known to be scientifically interesting it is important to be able to identify unusual or novel features that may be encountered This capability has now be fully integrated into the OASIS system and demonstrated with extensive testing While previously the system has focused on the opportunistic data using remote sensing by integration with the VTT capability additional information can be gathered as the rover approaches targets that have been identified from a distance With continued success of current and future surface operations the benefits of onboard science increase The OASIS system under the guidance and direction of scientists continues to expand its capabilities to better provide the tools for increasing mission science return 7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds.
