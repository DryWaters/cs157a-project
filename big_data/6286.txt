aspect of network management for instance for QoS security etc The continuous arising of new anomalies and attacks create a con tinuous challenge to cope with events that put the network integ rity at risk Most network anomaly detection systems proposed so far employ a supervised strategy to accomplish the task usi ng either signature-based detection methods or supervised-l earning techniques However both approaches present major limita tions the former fails to detect and characterize unknown anomali es letting the network unprotected for long periods  the lat ter requires training and labelled trafc which is difcult an d expensive to produce Such limitations impose a serious bottlene ck to the previously presented problem We introduce an unsuperv ised approach to detect and characterize network anomalies wit hout relying on signatures statistical training or labelled t rafc which represents a signicant step towards the autonomy of networ ks Unsupervised detection is accomplished by means of robust d ataclustering techniques combining Sub-Space clustering wi th Evidence Accumulation or Inter-Clustering Results Associat ion to blindly identify anomalies in trafc ows Correlating the results of the unsupervised detection is also performed for improvi ng the detection robustness Characterization is achieved by bui lding efcient ltering rules to describe a

Clustering Clusters Isolation Outliers Det ection Filtering Rules Anomaly Correlation I I NTRODUCTION Network anomaly detection has become a vital component of any network in today's Internet Ranging from nonmalicious unexpected events such as ash-crowds and failur es to network attacks such as denials-of-service and network scans network trafc anomalies can have serious detriment al effects on the performance and integrity of the network The principal challenge in automatically detecting and charac terizing trafc anomalies is that these are moving targets It i s difcult to precisely and permanently dene the set of possi ble anomalies that may arise especially in the case of network attacks because new attacks as well as new variants of alrea dy known attacks are continuously emerging A general anomaly detection system should therefore be able to detect a wide range of anomalies with diverse structures using the least amount of previous knowledge and information ideally none  The problem of network anomaly detection has been extensively studied during the last decade Two different approaches are by far dominant in current research literature and commercial detection systems signature-based detection and supervised-learning-based detection Both approaches re quire some kind of guidance to work hence they are generally referred to as supervised-detection approaches Signatur ebased detection systems are highly effective to detect thos e anomalies which are programmed to alert on When a new anomaly is discovered generally after its occurrence the associated signature is coded by human experts which is the n used to detect a new occurrence of the same anomaly Such a detection approach is powerful and very easy to understand because the operator can directly relate the detected anoma ly to its specic signature However these systems cannot def end the network against new attacks simply because they cannot recognize what they do not know Furthermore building new signatures is expensive as it involves manual inspection b y human experts On the other hand supervised-learning-based detection us es labelled trafc data to train a baseline model for normaloperation trafc detecting anomalies as patterns that dev iate from this model Such methods can detect new kinds of anomalies and network attacks not seen before because they will naturally deviate from the baseline Nevertheless supervised-learning requires training which is tim econsuming and depends on the availability of purely anomaly free trafc data-sets Labelling trafc as anomaly-free is expensive and hard to achieve in practice since it is difcult to guarantee that no anomalies are hidden inside the collected trafc Additionally it is not easy to maintain an accurate and up-to-date model for anomaly-free trafc particularly wh en new services and applications are constantly emerging We think that modern anomaly detection systems should not rely on previously acquired knowledge and be able to autonomously detect and characterize trafc deviating fro m normal-operation one Autonomous security is a strong requirement in current networks It is not acceptable to still rely on a human hand made analysis of anomalies and attacks for dening suited countermeasures Such a hand made process is slow inefcient costly and lets the network unprotecte d for several days in general The current business process in network security is not fullling network requirements in terms of fully efcient security We therefore proposed a completely unsupervised method to detect and characterize 


network anomalies without relying on signatures trainin g or labelled trafc of any kind It adds to network e.g routers  or security components thanks to unsupervised learning s ome analysis and decision making capabilities for limiting the need of a human operator This aims at making decision very fast and congure efciently and autonomously actual security devices IDS rewall  as soon as a

every built-in signature this system is u nable to classify or characterize the considered unknown anomaly  Our proposal falls within the unsupervised anomaly detection domain Most work has been devoted to the Intrusion Detection eld focused on the well known KDD'99 data-set The vast majority of the unsupervised detection schemes propos ed in the literature are based on clustering and outliers detec tion being 11   1 3  s o m e r e l e v a n t e x a m p l e s  I n  1 1   a u t h o r s u s e a single-linkage hierarchical clustering method to cluste r data from the KDD'99 data-set

consecutive stages Firstly multi-resolution ow aggregation is applied on the trafc i n order to build several simple metrics such as number of bytes  packets or ows Any time series based change detection algorithm is then applied to the previously built trafc met rics in order to detect a change This rst step is depicted on the upper part of gure 1 The unsupervised detection algorithm is depicted on the lower part of gure 1 and begins in the second stage using as input the set of ows captured in the time slot agged as anomalous Sub-Space Clustering SSC 14 a n d m u l t i p l e E v i d e n c e A c c u m u l a t i o n  E A   1 5  are used to blindly extract the suspicious trafc ows that compose the anomaly We however show in this paper that EA actually lacks robustness We hence propose a new technique to combine the SSC results called Inter-Clustering Results Association ICRA In order to provide further improvemen ts in terms of results robustness we introduce a new method to 


correlate anomalies detected in several feature spaces In the third stage of the algorithm the evidence of trafc structu re is further used to produce ltering rules that characterize the detected anomaly which are ultimately combined into a new anomaly signature This signature provides a simple and easy-to-interpret description of the problem easing netw ork operator tasks Our anomaly detection works on single-link packet-level trafc captured in consecutive time-slots of xed length  T  The rst analysis stage consists in change detection At each time-slot trafc is aggregated in 9 different ow levels l i  These include from ner to coarser-grained resolution source IPs  l 1  IPsrc  destination IPs  l 2  IPdst  source Network Prexes  l 3  4  5  IPsrc  24   16   8  destination Network Prexes  l 6  7  8  IPdst  24   16   8  and trafc per Time Slot  l 9  tpTS  Time series Z l i t are built for basic trafc metrics such as number of bytes packets and IP ows per time slot

case we use absolute deltoids 16 b a s e d o n v o l u m e metrics time series   packets   bytes and  syn  Time slot t j is agged as anomalous if F  Z l i t j  triggers an alarm for any of the l i ow aggregation levels Tracking anomalies at multiple aggregation levels provides additional reliabil ity to the anomaly detector and permits to detect both single sour cedestination and distributed attacks of very different inte nsities The unsupervised anomaly detection stage takes as input all the ows in the time slot agged as anomalous aggregated according to one of the different levels used in the rst stag e An anomaly will generally be detected in different aggregat ion levels and there are many ways to select a particular aggreg ation to use in the unsupervised stage for the sake of simplic ity we shall skip this issue and use any of the aggregation level s in which the anomaly was detected Without loss of generalit y let Y  f y 1   y F g be the set of F ows in the agged time slot referred to as patterns in more general terms Each ow y f 2 Y is described by a set of A trafc attributes or features  In this paper we use a list trafc attributes widely used in literature The list includes A  9 trafc features number of source/destination IP addresses and ports ratio of number of sources to number of destinations packet rate ratio of pac kets to number of destinations and fraction of ICMP and SYN packets According to our previous work on signature-based anomaly characterization 17  s u c h s i m p l e t r a f  c d e s c r i p tors permit characterization of general trafc anomalies in eas y-tointerpret terms The list is therefore by no means exhaustiv e and more features can be easily plugged-in to improve result s Let x f   x f 1   x f  A  2 R A be the corresponding vector of trafc features describing ow y f  and X   x 1    x F  the complete matrix of features referred to as the feature space  The unsupervised detection algorithm is based on clusterin g techniques applied to X  The objective of clustering is to partition a set of unlabelled patterns into homogeneous gro ups of similar characteristics based on some measure of simila rity Table I explains the characteristics of each anomaly in term s of type distributed nature aggregation type and netmask use d and impact on trafc features On one hand a SYN DDoS which targets one machine from a high number of hosts located in several 24 addresses will constitute a cluster i f ows are aggregated in l 3  In fact each of these 24 addresses will have trafc attributes values different from the ones of nor mal trafc a high number of packet a single destination and man y SYN packets It is the whole set of these ows that will create a cluster On the other hand if ows are aggregated in l 6  the only destination address will be an outlier characterized b y many sources and a high proportion of SYN packets Our particular goal is to identify and to isolate the differe nt ows that compose the anomaly agged in the rst stage both in a robust way Unfortunately even if hundreds of clusteri ng algorithms exist 18  i t i s v e r y d i f  c u l t t o  n d a s i n g l e o n e that can handle all types of cluster shapes and sizes or even deci de which algorithm would be the best for our particular problem  Different clustering algorithms produce different partit ions of data and even the same clustering algorithm provides different results when using different initializations an d/or different algorithm parameters This is in fact one of the ma jor drawbacks in current cluster analysis techniques the lack of robustness To avoid such a limitation we have developed a divide and conquer clustering approach using the notions of clusteri ng ensemble 19 a n d m u l t i p l e c l u s t e r i n g s c o m b i n a t i o n  A c l u s tering ensemble P consists of a set of N partitions P n produced for the same data with n  1   N  Each of these partitions provides a different and independent evidence of data struc ture which can be combined to construct a global clustering result for the whole feature space There are different ways to produce a clustering ensemble We use Sub-Space Clustering SSC 14 t o p r o d u c e m u l t i p l e d a t a p a r t i t i o n s  a p p l y i n g t h e same clustering algorithm to N different sub-spaces U n  X of the original space A Clustering Ensemble and Sub-Space Clustering Each of the N sub-spaces U n  X is obtained by selecting R features from the complete set of A attributes The number of sub-spaces N hence is equal to R combinations-obtainedfromA  To set the sub-space dimension R  we take a very useful property of monotonicity in clustering sets known a s the downward closure property if a collection of points is a cluster in a d dimensional space then it is also part of a cluster in any  d  1 projections of this space 20  T h i s d i r e c t l y implies that if there exists any evidence of density in X  it will certainly be present in its lowest-dimensional sub-sp aces Using small values for R provides several advantages rstly doing clustering in low-dimensional spaces is more efcien t and faster than clustering in bigger dimensions Secondly density-based clustering algorithms provide better resul ts in low-dimensional spaces 20  b e c a u s e h i g h d i m e n s i o n a l s p aces are usually sparse making it difcult to distinguish betwe en high and low density regions We shall therefore use R  2 in our SSC algorithm which gives N  C A R  A  A  1  2 partitions

now explore different methods to combine these partitions in order to build a singl e partition where anomalous ows are easily distinguishable from normal-operation trafc the classical Evidence Accu mulation EA and the new Inter-Clustering Result Associatio n ICRA method 1 Combining Multiple Partitions using Evidence Accumulation A possible answer is provided in 15  w h e r e authors introduced the idea of multiple-clusterings Evide nce Accumulation EA By simple denition of what it is an anomaly may consist of either outliers or small-size cluste rs depending on the aggregation level of ows in Y cf table I EA then uses the cluster ensemble P to build two interpattern similarity measures between the ows in Y  These similarity measures are stored in two elements a similarit y matrix S to detect small clusters and a vector D used to rank outliers S  p q  represents the similarity between ows p and q  This value increases when the ows p and q are in the same cluster many times and when the size of this cluster is small These two parameters allows the algorithm to target small clusters D  o  represents the abnormality of the outlier o  This value increases when the outlier has been classied as such several times and when the separation between the outlier and the normal trafc is important As we are only interested in nding the smallest-size clusters and the mos t dissimilar outliers the detection consists in nding the  ows with the biggest similarity in S and the biggest dissimilarity in D  Any clustering algorithm can then be applied on the matrix S values to obtain a nal partition of X that isolates smallsize clusters of close similarity values A variable detect ion threshold over the values in S is also able to detect small-size cluster Concerning dissimilar outliers they can be isola ted though a threshold applied on the values in D  2 Combining Multiple Partitions using Inter-Clustering result Association However by reasoning over the similarities between patterns here ows EA introduces several potent ial errors Let us consider two pattern sets P i and P j  if the cardinality of these pattern sets is close and if they are pre sent in a similar number of sub-spaces then EA will produce a very close potentially the same similarity value for both ow s ets They will then likely be falsely considered as belonging to t he same cluster This possibility is to be considered very seri ously as it can induce a huge error different anomalies will be merged together and will then likely be wrongly identied an d characterized Another source of potential error when usin g a clustering algorithm over S values is the algorithm sensitivity to wrong parameters Furthermore the use of a threshold ove r S and/or D can decrease the system performance in case of a wrong value used In order to avoid the previously exposed sources of error we introduce a new way of combining clustering results obtaine d from sub-spaces Inter-Clustering Results Association T he idea is to address the problem in terms of cluster of ows and outlier of ow similarity instead of pattern or ow simila rity Hence we shift the similarity measure from the patterns to t he clustering results The problem can then be split in two subproblems correlate clusters through Inter-CLuster Assoc iation ICLA and correlate outlier through Inter-Outlier Assoc iation IOA In each case a graph is used to express similarity between either clusters or outliers Each vertex is a cluster/outli er from any sub-space U n and each edge represents the fact that two connected vertices are similar The underlying idea is straightforward identify clusters or outliers present in different sub-spaces that contain the same ows To do so we rst dene a cluster similarity measure called CS between two clusters C r and C s  CS  C r  C s   card  C r  C s  max  card  C r  card  C s   card being the function that associates a pattern set with its cardinality and C r  C s the intersection of C r and C s  Each edge in the cluster similarity graph between two C r and C s means CS  C r  C s   0  9  being this an empirically chosen value 1 IOA uses an outlier similarity graph built by linking every outlier to every other outlier that contains the same pattern Once these graphs are built we need to nd cluster sets where every cluster contains the same ows In terms of vertices we need to nd vertex sets where every vertex is linked to every other vertex In graph theory such vertex se t is called a clique  The clique search problem is a NP-hard problem Most existing solutions use exhaustive search ins ide 1 The value 0  9 guarantees that the vast majority of patterns are located in both clusters with a small margin of error 


the vertex set which is too slow for our application We then make the hypothesis that a vertex can only be part of a single clique A greedy algorithm is then used to build each clique Anomalous ow set are nally identied as the intersection o f all the ow sets present in the clusters or outliers within ea ch clique IV C ORRELATING ANOMALIES FROM MULTIPLE AGGREGATION At the end of the ICLA/IOA step many anomalies can be found However it is a priori not possible to assess an anomaly's potential danger A good way to evaluate its potential impact is to nd out whether it is visible in severa l aggregation levels l i  In fact if an anomaly appears as such within several aggregation levels it means that its ows are signicantly different from the normal trafc in each of these aggregation levels and thus potentially dangerous in each of them Therefore we present a system that correlates anomalies found in several aggregation levels l i in order to lter anomalies present in one or few aggregation level and thus that we consider as having a limited impact The system will then also able to characterize the anomaly through a signature for each aggregation level used thus improving t he characterization reliability In order to correlate anomalies from different aggregation levels we dene two unique characteristics of an anomaly i ts source source IP address set and its destination destina tion IP address set We then dene the similarity between two IP address sets as the ratio between the sets intersection cardinality and the maximum cardinality of each IP address sets If the similarities of the two IP address sets source a nd destination of two different anomalies are over a specic threshold it guarantees that these anomalies have a very similar source and destination IP address sets In this work  we chose to only correlate anomalies detected from aggregatio n levels source and destination in order to avoid correlatin g anomalies located in same aggregation level type e.g l 3 and l 4  that would be potentially contained in each other Finall y correlated anomalies are then built from each couple of simi lar anomalies V A UTOMATIC C HARACTERIZATION OF A NOMALIES At this stage the algorithm has identied several correlat ed anomalies containing a set of trafc ows in Y far out the rest of the trafc The following task is to produce ltering rules to correctly isolate and characterize each o f these anomalies Even more this signature could eventuall y be compared against well-known signatures to automaticall y classify the anomaly In order to produce ltering rules the algorithm selects those sub-spaces U n where the separation between the considered anomalous ows and the rest of the trafc is the biggest We dene two different classes of ltering rule absolute rules F R A  Y  and relative rules F R R  Y   Absolute rules do not depend on the separation between ows and correspond to the presence of dominant features in the considered ows An absolute rule for a certain feature j characterizing a certain ow set Y g has the form F R A  Y g  a   f8 y f 2 Y g  Y  x f  a    g  For example in the case of an ICMP ooding attack the vast majority of the associated ows use only ICMP packets hence the absolute ltering rule f nICMP  nPkts  1 g makes sense On the contrary relative ltering rules depend on the relative separation b etween anomalous and normal-operation ows Basically if t he anomalous ows are well separated from the normal cluster in a certain partition P n  then the features of the corresponding sub-space U n are good candidates to dene a relative ltering rule A relative rule has the form F R R  Y g  a   f8 y f 2 Y g  Y  x f  a    _ x f  a    g  We shall also dene a covering relation between ltering rules we say that rule f 1 covers rule f 2  f 2  Y   f 1  Y   If two or more rules overlap i.e they are associated to the same feature the algorit hm keeps the one that covers the rest In order to construct a compact signature of the anomaly we have to devise a procedure to select the most discriminant ltering rules Absolute rules are important because they dene inherent characteristics of the anomaly As regards relatives rules their relevance is directly tied to the deg ree of separation between anomalous and normal ows In the case of outliers we select the K features for which the Mahalanobis distance to the normal-operation trafc is among the topK biggest distances In the case of small-size clusters we rank the relatives rules according to the degree of separati on to the normal anomaly using the well-known Fisher Score FS which uses the variance in each cluster normal and anomalous To nally construct the signature the absolut e rules and the topK relative rules are combined into a single inclusive predicate using the covering relation in case of overlapping rules VI C OMPUTATIONAL T IME AND P ARALLELIZATION The last issue that we analyze is the Computational Time CT of the algorithm The SSC-EA/ICRA-based algorithm performs multiple clusterings in N  A  low-dimensional subspaces U n  X  This multiple computation imposes scalability issues for on-line detection of attacks in very-high-sp eed networks Two key features of the algorithm are exploited to reduce scalability problems in number of features A and the number of aggregated ows F to analyze Firstly clustering is performed in very-low-dimensional sub-spaces U n 2 R 2  which is faster than clustering in high-dimensional spaces 18  Secondly each sub-space can be clustered independently of the other sub-spaces which is perfectly adapted for parall el computing architectures Parallelization can be achieved in different ways using a single multi-processor and multi-c ore machine using network-processor cards and/or GPU Graphi c Processor Unit capabilities using a distributed group of machines or combining these techniques We shall use the term slice as a reference to a single computational entity  Figure 2 depicts the CT of the SSC-EA/ICRA-based algorithm both a as a function of the number of features A used to describe trafc ows and b as a function of the

from 2 to 29 features We analyze a large number of aggregated ows F  10 4  and use two different number of slices S  40 and S  100  The analysis is done with trafc from the WIDE network combining different traces to attain the desired number of ows To estimate the CT of SSC for a given value of A and S  we proceed as follows rst we separately cluster each of the N  A  A  1  2 subspaces X i  and take the worst-case of the obtained clustering time as a representative measure of the CT in a single subspace i.e CT  X SSCwc   max n CT  U n   Then if N 6 S  we have enough slices to completely parallelize the SSC algorithm and the total CT corresponds to the worst-case CT  X SSCwc   On the contrary if N  S  some slices have to cluster various sub-spaces one after the other and the tot al CT becomes  N  S  1 times the worst-case CT  X SSCwc   where  represents integer division The rst interesting observation from gure 2.\(a regards the increase of CT  X  when A increases going from about 8 seconds for A  2 to more than 200 seconds for A  29  As we said before clustering in low-dimensional spaces is faster which redu ces the overhead of multiple clusterings computation The seco nd paramount observation is about parallelization if the alg orithm is implemented in a parallel computing architecture it can be used to analyze large volumes of trafc using many trafc descriptors in an on-line basis for example if we use 20 trafc features and a parallel architecture with 100 slices we can analyze 10000 aggregated ows in less than 20 seconds Figure 2.\(b compares CT  X  against CT  X SSCwc  for an increasing number of ows F to analyze using A  20 trafc features and S  N  190 slices i.e a completely parallelized implementation of the SSC-EA-based algorithm As before we can appreciate the difference in CT when clusteri ng the complete feature space vs using low-dimensional subspaces the difference is more than one order of magnitude independently of the number of ows to analyze Regarding the volume of trafc that can be analyzed with this 100 parallel conguration the SSC-EA/ICRA-based algorithm c an analyze up to 50000 ows with a reasonable CT about 4 minutes in this experience In the presented evaluations t he number of aggregated ows in a time slot of  T  20 seconds rounds the 2500 ows which represents a value of CT  X SSCwc   0  4 seconds For the m  9 features that we have used  N  36  and even without doing parallelization the total CT is N  CT  X SSCwc   14  4 seconds VII E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION IN R EAL T RAFFIC We evaluate the ability of our

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Our scheme eliminates all redundant rules in the sense of [25, 31], i.e. those association rules that are not in the covers. All the meta-rule deductive schemes implicitly included in [25] and [31] are induced by our method. The percentage of pruning, thus, outperforms [25

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
