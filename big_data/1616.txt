Similarly, to under-\nstand the formation of the cosmos, galaxy formation simulations\nare run using tens to hundreds of millions of particles. From the\natomically small to the astronomically large, these simulations\nproduce immense amounts of data. While these simulations\nhave been shown to produce excellent results matching real-\nworld observations, the daunting Big Data that they produce\ncan be difficult to work with. Numerical analysis is useful for\nprocessing this large quantity of data, but visual analysis is also\nimportant in the search for identifying interesting results and\nformulating new hypotheses to explore.\nThough many level-of-detail techniques exist for structured and\ngeometric data allowing scalable interactive visualization, un-\nstructured particle data is not suitable for these techniques.\nTherefore, we have developed a new technique for scalable\nvisualization of massive particle datasets. The technique is\ndifferent from previous level-of-detail techniques which create\nprogressive approximations of the data itself. Instead, the\ntechnique creates a volumetric representation of the data first\nand then creates a hierarchy of progressive approximations of\nthe volumetric representation. An adaptive volume rendering\ntechnique is also presented that progressively refines the volume\nhierarchy depending on the view of the data and the time avail-\nable to load data. The technique provides a scalable framework,\nallowing various levels of detail to be loaded while maintaining\ninteractivity.\nThis paper describes the rendering techniques used to produce\nthe 3D volume hierarchy as well as the adaptive volume ren-\nderer used for interactive visualization. Three case studies are\ndiscussed as examples of interactive visualization. Two are from\na molecular dynamics simulation, one containing approximately\n22 million particles per time-step over 100 time-steps and one\ncontaining a range of particles containing a total of 230 million\nparticles over 9 timesteps. The third example is a single timestep\ncontaining 128 million particle from a cosmology simulation.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1 INTRODUCTION 1\n2 RELATED WORK 2\n978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 c©2013 IEEE.\n3 TECHNICAL APPROACH 3\n4 VOLUME RENDERING . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n5 RESULTS 6\n6 ACCURACY 6\n7 DISCUSSION 7\n8 CONCLUSION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n9 FUTURE WORK . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\nREFERENCES 8\nBIOGRAPHY 9\n1. INTRODUCTION\nInteractive rendering of tera-scale, unstructured point-based\ndata has proven to be difficult due to size and the limitations\nof current level of detail approaches. Traditional surface or\nmesh based level of detail algorithms are ineffective for un-\nstructured point datasets because they are often disconnected\nand sparse or of highly complicated shapes. Also, due to\nthe large scale of these datasets, when viewed as a whole\nthe feature size of the data is so small that individual objects\noccur at a sub-pixel level and lead to aliasing. Even though\nmodern graphics hardware is able to render reasonably large\ndatasets at interactive rates, the fact that rendering is limited\nto pixel-grain operations, such as depth testing, makes it\nimpossible to properly render data that has multiple inter-\nsections or occlusions occurring within single pixels. Since\nresearchers will typically want to look at both macroscopic\neffects happening over large regions of space and time as well\nas microscopic interactions occurring deep within the data,\nviable techniques must work equally well for both bird’s-eye\nviews and close-up examinations within the data set.\nWhile offline rendering can produce high-quality images and\nvideo from the generated data, interactive systems for 3D\ninterrogation provide a quicker visual feedback loop for in-\nspection. It is the user’s freedom of exploration that empow-\ners analytical reasoning by means of interactive visualization.\nWith large datasets in particular this is difficult, as directly\nloading the data can be prohibitively slow. Addressing how\ndata can be represented in an efficient and scalable form, such\nthat high-quality and high-detail visuals can be generated for\nspatio-temporal exploration at arbitrary resolution 


is crucial.\nFor particle simulations, the target datasets may include\nhundreds of million to billions of particles, with each particle\nbeing described by its \(x,y,z These large sets of particles are often just\n1\na single timestep in a sequence of potentially thousands of\ntimesteps. Traditionally, the only way to visualize this type\nof data is to render movie sequences from a fixed view or\nto use large cluster machines with very fast interconnects.\nRendering could take several hours and produce only static\nimagery, even with the use of large visualization clusters.\nWe introduce a level of detail algorithm which addresses\nthese problems and enables the interactive visualization of\nmassive unstructured, particle data sets. As a preprocessing\nstep, we walk through the data in thin slabs that are orthogo-\nnal to a viewing direction and generate high resolution images\nof each slab. We then create a multi-resolution pyramid of\nimposters from these image slabs which is used to represent\n3D regions of space by stacking the imposters into volumes.\nAt a zoomed-out level, these imposters represent a high-\nquality pre-filtered view of the data, similar to a 3D mipmap.\nEach region of space can be progressively refined to increase\nresolution and stream in detail. At the closest view, the\noriginal full resolution slabs are used.\nThe preprocessing step is straightforward to integrate with\nexisting rendering systems and amenable to out-of-core ren-\ndering which can assist with extremely large datasets. Since\ndata is imaged in one slab at a time, only that subset of\ndata needs to be loaded. Furthermore, the preprocessing is\nembarrassingly parallelizable with a granularity related to the\nnumber of slabs used.\nImaging the dataset in thin slabs along a viewing direction\nproduces perfect representations for that view only. However,\nas the view changes, the set of visible particles change. For\nthis reason, six sets of imposters are created, one for each of\nthe principle axes in both the positive and negative viewing\ndirections. When the angle of view changes by more than 45\ndegrees off one of these principle axes, a new set of imposter\ndata for the new viewing direction is loaded. This has the\nadded advantage of ensuring that the texture axes in video\nmemory are always in a cache friendly orientation.\nIn order to organize and operate on the large number of 3D\nvolume imposters that are created, a volume block hierarchy\nbased on an octree is introduced. The volume data is seg-\nmented into small tiles that are grouped into volume blocks.\nThis gives a fine granularity for occlusion culling, caching,\nand refinement without introducing significant computational\nor memory overhead.\nWe demonstrate an implementation that is able to render hun-\ndreds of millions of particles over a large set of timesteps at\ninteractive rates stemming from cosmological particle simu-\nlations as well as atomistic dislocation dynamics simulations.\n2 RELATED WORK\nVolume rendering has been established as a promising ap-\nproach for the rendering of highly complex scene data. Kauf-\nman et al. [1] demonstrated a method to create texture voxels\nfrom 3D geometry and then render that geometry as a volume\nobject, which has the advantage of being scene agnostic in\nrendering performance. Later work used a combination of the\nGPU’s 2D rasterization hardware and depth buffer to generate\nthe 3D voxelizations one slab at a time completely on the\nvideo card [2]. We use a similar approach marching through\nthe data in thin slabs and rendering that data to generate our\nvolume textures. However, what was not considered is what\nhappens when scene feature sizes are smaller than a single\nFigure 1. A 128 million particle dataset from a cosmological\nsimulation rendered in real-time at 60 frames per second. The\nnearest corner has a finer level of detail refinement while the\nfurther regions are at the lowest resolution.\nvoxel and how to approach view dependent voxelization. Our\napproach renders high-resolution slabs and then filters them\ndown to lower resolutions which allow us to capture details at\na sub-voxel level. Also, because we generate slabs for each\nof the six axis directions, we maintain some aspects of the\ndata that change with viewing direction, such as occlusion\nand lighting.\nLevoy and Hanrahan [3] and more recently Chen et al 4]\nalso considered how the representation of a scene changes\nwith view in their research on light field rendering. However,\nthis requires the tracking of a significant number of view\ndirections, and requires visualizing the scene from outside of\na convex hull. Our approach allows the user to move inside\nthe data volume and only requires pre-computing six viewing\ndirections.\nMueller et al. [5] showed promising results using image-\nbased rendering to accelerate volume rendering. Using cam-\neras positioned at key locations to render samples of their\nscene, they generated new images at arbitrary locations using\nstandard image warping techniques. Our approach uses a\nsimilar technique of pre-imaging slabs, except we start with\nreal geometry instead of volumetric data and supersample\nthe data to achieve high quality images. We did not use\nany warping or depth offset approaches, partly because the\ndepth of pixels containing multiple particles is ill-defined,\nand partly because we sampled the depth direction at closer\nintervals.\nSeveral issues arise when using image-based rendering tech-\nniques, including disocclusion. Shade [6] introduced Layered\nDepth Images which contain multiple layers of data at each\npixel. These additional layers are used to fill in the scene\nwhen a gap appears as a result of disocclusion. A software\nrendering engine was required for this 


approach, to find each\nof the disoccluded depth values. Our approach is similar\n2\nin that we have a series of pixels along the depth of the\nview, however we use many more layers which are regularly\nsampled and do not depend on occlusion, allowing them to be\nprocessed and rendered on graphics hardware.\nThere have also been many attempts to use point primitives\nto approximate complex geometry [7], [8]. Our particle\npre-rendering is based on a point sprite system, where each\nparticle is rendered as a single point with a texture mapped\nsphere. While this renders upwards of a million particles\ninteractively, it was found to be insufficient for real time\nvisualization of larger sets because it was difficult to approx-\nimate particles when they were being drawn at or below the\nsize of a single pixel. We believe that point-based rendering\napproaches are only effective when the feature size of data\n\(such as individual surface patches no smaller than a few\npixels. EWA Splatting [9] pushes the limits of reconstructing\nfeatures that approach the single-pixel level. Beyond that it\nbecomes difficult to approximate objects with points when\nmultiple objects map to a single pixel. Our texture-based\napproach alleviates this problem by pre-rendering very large\ntextures and then filtering down to the desired screen reso-\nlutions. This ensures that a reasonable representation of the\nunderlying data is available for use at lower resolutions.\nFar Voxels [10] uses a multiresolution voxel approximation\nfor large-scale triangle meshes. They argue that traditional\nmesh simplification algorithms fail in the case of highly\ncomplex data with large depth variance and self occlusion.\nLike our approach, they build a hierarchy of voxels to rep-\nresent the underlying data. However, their approach is only\napplicable to surface meshes and their use of un-sorted points\nas the rendering primitives means they are unable to handle\ntransparency or blending. Our approach handles completely\nunstructured point data with any topology Furthermore, the\nuse of correctly ordered back-to-front blending allows for\ntransparency and therefore better coverage approximation of\npartially filled regions.\n3. TECHNICAL APPROACH\nThe technical contribution of this paper is a new level of detail\nsystem for particle data. The level of detail consists of a\nhierarchy of volumetric representations of the data that can be\nprogressively loaded from low-resolution to high-resolution.\nThis allows all of the benefits of a level of detail system:\nquick loading of the low-resolution representation for imme-\ndiate interaction, visually smooth progression between levels\nof detail, and a high-quality representation at full-resolution.\nThis section describes the organization of the level of detail\ndata structure, how to produce it from the original data, and\nhow to render it in real-time The rendering section also\ndescribes how the data structure is amenable to traditional\nacceleration techniques for working with large 3D scenes,\nincluding frustum culling, out-of-core data rendering, data\ncaching, and empty space skipping.\nVolume Texture Overview\nThe level of detail system works by transforming small 3D\nregions of particles into a 3D volumetric representation. Each\nvolume represents an axis-aligned orthogonal parallelepiped\nof space and is drawn using volumetric textures. These\nvolumes are split into n slabs and a 2D image is used to\nrepresent each slab. The entire volume can be drawn using\na stack of texture mapped quads one per slab.\nFigure 2. Overview of preprocessing\(a,b,c d dataset are computed and\nan octree is built. b X,Y,Z directions. c proceeds on the octree volume hierarchy. Tiles of\nhigher resolution are streamed in based on view.\nSix stacks of 2D textures are generated for each volume\ntexture, one aligned with each direction of the faces on a\ncube This is done for two main reasons. First, each 3D\nrepresentation is only suitable for a limited view. The further\naway you get from the orthogonal view used to generate it,\nthe less true the representation is. Using six sets allows\nreconstruction of the underlying space from any viewing\ndirection. Second, it is important to generate images from\ndifferent directions since the visibility of elements in the\nscene changes with the view Using multiple views allows\nthe capture of features such as surface intersection, partial\nocclusion and directional lighting, which change with view.\nThe set of volume textures that represent the entire dataset\nare organized into an octree. An axis-aligned bounding box\nfitting the whole dataset is selected and then progressively\nsplit into eight child nodes until the child nodes match the\ndesired volume size. While each node in the hierarchy\ncontains the same resolution texture volume, each child node\nrepresents a smaller region of space. Therefore each child\nnode in the hierarchy has a higher spatial resolution than its\nparent node.\nDue to the way the textures are rendered, each volume\ntexture requires an extra border, so that blending with the\nadjacent volume textures is correct. This is discussed in the\npreprocessing and rendering sections.\nPreprocessing\nThe purpose of the preprocessing step is to transform the\nraw particle data into a set of progressive resolution texture\nvolumes which can be efficiently loaded and rendered. How\nto do this with large data in an out-of-core, parallelizable way\nis presented.\nDimensions and Resolution Selection—The first step is to\ncompute an axis-aligned bounding volume for the dataset\nand determine the resolution of the volume 


textures. It\nis convenient to select a bounding volume such that each\ntexture volume will have equal sized dimensions, otherwise\nthe spatial resolution of the images will vary. We found the\nfollowing rules for the dimensions to be convenient to work\nwith:\n3\n• The 3D aspect ratio of the bounding volume should be\nrounded up to be powers of two.\n• The resolution of volume textures should be powers of two.\n• If the bounding volumes change between timesteps, then\none bounding volume containing all timesteps should be\nused. Extra empty space around the borders is handled by\nempty space skipping.\nThe bounding volumes for one of the datasets in our case\nstudy are in the shape of a rectangular prism with two sides\nbeing of similar length and the third side being slightly more\nthan seven times longer. We set the two sides of similar length\nequal to the next largest whole number and round the longer\nside up to eight times that size \(Table 1 resolution of the textures to use\nfor the highest level of detail. It should be a high enough\nresolution that individual particle features are visible at this\nlevel. One strategy is to divide the length of the bounding\nbox by the feature size of a particle, multiply by the smallest\nnumber of pixels that should represent that feature, and round\nup to the nearest power of two. Given that the particles\nused in this simulation have a diameter of 3.13 units, for the\ndirection with a length of 724 units a resolution of 1024 gives\nan approximate 4.5 pixel diameter per particle. \(Table 2 data can be spatially\nsorted into the corresponding octree leaf nodes using a simple\nbin sort, which will assist in frustum culling and reduce the\nin-core footprint of data loaded during rendering by removing\nunnecessary data.\nRendering Slab Images—Once the bounding box and image\ndimensions are tabulated the rendering can begin. First, the\nhighest resolution volume textures will be generated, then\neach of the lower resolution nodes will be generated by\nmerging adjacent volume textures and filtering their textures\ndown to the lower resolution. Each volume texture take six\npasses to generate the texture stacks, one for each direction.\nFor each direction, the volume is segmented along its depth\ninto n slabs and each slab is rendered in turn \(Figure 2 the image generated represents the\nview of the slab in that direction. The boundary of each slab\nis extended by one pixel in order to include a border pixel\nfor proper texture blending, and an extra slab at the front\nand back of the volume texture is rendered. The necessity of\nthis border pixel is explained in further detail in the volume\nrendering section.\nIn order to handle particles which intersect the front of the\nslab without rendering holes in the particles, the front of the\nslab is expanded forward by the radius of a particle. However\nparticles which would then intersect the new front need to\nbe discarded. Particles intersecting the back of the slab are\nremoved as well, and will be imaged as part of the next slab.\nThe effects of this are demonstrated in Figure 3. Adjusting the\nfront slab boundary and then removing particles that intersect\nthe front and back boundary can be done in a vertex shader.\nMemory Management and Parallelism—One thing to note\nis that multiple adjacent volume textures can be imaged\ntogether. This can result in a performance improvement, as\nless overall draw calls are used, and it makes it easier to\ninclude border pixels. The maxmimum number of adjacent\nvolume textures that can be rendered can be limited by the\nmaximum framebuffer size limitations of the GPU, which is\nFigure 3. A comparison of particle clipping techniques.\nThe left image shows individual particles being clipped when\nthey pass the boundary of slabs while the right image shows\nparticles drawn without clipping.\nFigure 4. Volume Texture Hierarchy Generation: a Data\nis organized spatially. b High-resolution images\nof each slab are subsampled to desired lower resolutions.\nd sub-images and grouped into\ntexture volumes.\ntypically 8192 by 8192 pixels.\nFurthermore, rendering slabs is a divide-and-conquer\nmethod. Since each slab is a small subsection of the overall\ndata, even very large particle datasets can be processed, as a\nsingle slab still easily fits in memory on a modest workstation\ncomputer Also, the rendering of slabs can be parallelized\nacross multiple computers to reduce preprocessing time.\nEach computer can render a subset of volume textures or\nindividual slabs, and then all of them can be combined.\nMerging—The next step is to build the texture hierarchy from\nthe high-resolution volume textures Figure 4.d together. Each of their adjacent 2D\nimages are reduced in size by factors of two in each direction.\nThis happens in two steps: first a merge is done between two\nslabs, giving preference to pixels in the front slab then a 2D\nfilter kernel is applied to the resulting image to reduce the\nwidth and height. For best quality the highest resolution is\nused as the starting point for each level of detail, using a larger\nfilter kernel for the lower levels of resolution.\nCompressing and writing to disk—As a last step each volume\ntexture is written to disk in a compressed format. First each\nvolume texture’s data is compressed using gzip. Then the\nvolume textures are written to file in spatial order. A header\nkeeps track of the file offset and length 


of each volume\ntexture, allowing volume textures to be loaded in any order,\nwhich is necessary for caching visibility culling, and view\nbased level of detail refinement. A different file is used for\neach timestep.\n4\nOriginal Bounds Length Aspect Ratio\n[-361.52, 361.53] 723.06 1.00\n[-361.52, 361.53] 723.06 1.00\n[-2283.48,\n2891.00]\n5174.48 7.15\nAdjusted Bounds Length Aspect Ratio\n[-362, 362] 724 1\n[-362, 362] 724 1\n[-2592, 3200] 5792 8\nTable 1.

In each\nvolume direction the voxel resolution in the Z direction has\nbeen reduced by four to save space.\nReferencing tiles\nVolume images have a large number of individual image tiles.\nFor example a single timestep, including all six different\ndirections, imaged at 16384x2048x512 with 64x64x64 res-\nolution volume textures, there are 786,432 volume textures.\nTo keep track of which tiles are loaded in cache, as well as\nto address the tiles for loading from disk and drawing from\ntexture memory, it is convenient to use a map or other search\ntree based on a multi-dimensional parameterization. Each\nvolume texture is referenced by its x,y, and z index, timestep,\nand level of detail, and a binary tree based map is used, which\nguarantees O\(lg\(n tile is in the\nmap.\nHierarchy\nOnce tiles are grouped into volume groups that are consistent\nacross each viewing direction and for all timesteps, an octree\nis formed from the leaf nodes up to the root, grouping neigh-\nboring nodes in groups of 2x2x2. This is done for as many\ndifferent levels of detail as were generated in preprocessing.\n4. VOLUME RENDERING\nRendering the texture hierarchy is similar to other progressive\nresolution volume renderers, with the exception that there\nare six view dependent textures instead of a single view\nindependent texture. This section describes how each texture\nvolume is rendered, how the hierarchy is refined, and how\nacceleration techniques such as caching and frustum culling\nare performed.\nRendering individual volume textures is straightforward.\nFirst the current camera view of the texture volume is ana-\nlyzed and the dominant view direction is used to select which\nof the six textures to use. Then, for each slab in the volume\ntexture, the corresponding image gets texture mapped onto a\nquadrilateral filling the center of the spatial footprint of the\noriginal slab. The textured quadrilaterals are drawn in a back\nto front order with respect to the camera so that blending can\nbe performed to remove invisible regions and blend partially\nopaque pixels correctly. Since 2D textures are drawn on\nsimple geometry the rendering itself is very fast.\nLevel of Detail Refinement\nThe hierarchy of volume textures is adjusted as the camera\nviewpoint moves and as higher detail volume textures are\nloaded from disk. The coursest octree node is loaded first,\nthen a view dependent selection process determines which\nnodes in the octree are refined Since texture memory is a\nfinite resource, a fixed-size pool of allocation slots for volume\ntextures is continually reallocated as the octree refinement\nchanges. The refinement process is controlled by two priority\nqueues, a split queue and a merge queue. The split queue\ncontains all nodes which are currently below their optimal\nlevel of resolution, while the merge queue contains all nodes\nwhich are either not currently visible, or are at a resolution\nthat is higher than necessary.\nThe refinement process consists of the following steps when\nthe view changes. First, occlusion culling is performed\nhierarchically on the octree and all nodes are marked as\ninside, outside, or intersecting the viewing frustum. Next,\na list of potential nodes to be split and refined is formed from\nall of the visible leaf nodes. Each of these nodes has its\nprojected area computed and if either the projected area is\nbelow a threshold or the number of filled pixels in the volume\nis too small \(see below order of largest\nprojected area. These nodes are split by creating their child\nnodes, and the new nodes are sent to the texture loader to have\ntheir textures fetched. This allows the refinement from course\nto finer textures \(Figure 5 which will be recycled and used\nby the splitting process for other nodes. As soon as a node\nis outside the viewing frustum, it is added to the merge list.\nVisible nodes whose projected area is smaller than a threshold\nare also added to the merge list. The merge list is sorted in\nthe reverse order as the split list such that the node with the\nsmallest projected area is merged first.\nTo approximate the screen space coverage of a octree node,\nthe projected area of the front facing side of its bounding box\nis computed. Each of the four vertices is projected onto the\nimage plane then the area of that polygon is computed using\na convolution integral, as described in [11]. This gives an\naccurate pixel count for the front face of the cube which is\nsufficient to classify the projected area of the whole volume.\nTexture Loading and Caching\nWhile the rendering of the volume texture hierarchy is very\nquick, loading texture volume data from disk can be slow 


To\nprevent this from effecting interactive performance, all tex-\nture load requests are handled asynchronously by a separate\nthread. Furthermore, a cache is used to store recently used\nvolume textures in system memory when they are merged\nout of texture memory. Since main memory is generally\nseveral times larger than texture memory, this prevents a lot\nof texture volumes from having to be reloaded from disk and\ndecompressed.\n5\nFigure 5. An example of texture refinement for a small patch\nof tiles. Resolution increases left-to-right top-to-bottom. The\ntop-left image shows the illustrated neighborhood.\nFigure 6. An example of volume slicing to focus on a subset\nof data. In image a has been removed. Features in that slice\nare now easier to differentiate.\nAdvantages of Volume Rendering\nThe use of volume rendering simplifies the exploration of\ndata. Since all of the data is organized in an octree seg-\nmenting regions of data for interrogation is straightforward.\nWith raw particle data, selecting subregions can be difficult,\nas individual points have to be sorted and then queried for\ninclusion or exclusion. Figure 6 demonstrates the ability to\nvisualize a subset of particles. Image a of the entire galaxy dataset while image b the\ndata. This more clearly shows features in the subset of data\nsuch as the vein-like networks that the particles make.\n5. RESULTS\nFor our test implementation, we used two different datasets\nfrom molecular dynamics simulations [12], [13] and one\nfrom a cosmology simulation. The original data from the\nsimulations ranges from two hundred and fifty million to\na billion particles per timestep. However, many of those\nparticles have been removed in order to reveal structures\nalong dislocation planes and fracture boundaries.\nThe first dataset contains 1.33 billion particles over 73\ntimesteps for a total of 21.3 GB of raw point data. Each\ntexture volume was imaged at a resolution of 2048x2048x512\nvoxels in six different directions for a total of 48 GB of texture\ndata per timestep, or 3.5 TB for the whole time series. This\ncompresses down to 115 GB of data, or a ratio of 30:1. At the\nhighest level of detail individual particles are clearly visible.\nThe second dataset contains 230 million particles over\n9 timesteps and was imaged at a higher resolution,\n16384x2048x512 voxels or 16 billion voxels in six different\ndirections for a total of 384 GB of texture data per timestep,\nor 3.375 TB of texture data for the whole series. This\ncompresses down to 188 GB, or a ratio of 18:1. At this high\nresolution particles are seen as high-quality spheres. A much\nhigher resolution is used than would be necessary before\nswitching to rendering the actual data. This demonstrates the\nextreme scalability of the texture hierarchy approach.\nThe third dataset contains a single timestep with 128\nmillion particles from a cosmology simulation imaged at\n256x256x256 voxels or 16 million voxels. In addition to\nusing the volume texture hierarchy, individual particles are\nloaded and drawn at the highest resolution. Figure 1 shows an\nexample of the whole dataset with the nearest corner refined\nto higher resolution.\nRendering tests were performed on a computer with a dual-\nprocessor AMD Opteron 2.0 GHz CPU, a QuadroFX 4500\nGPU, 6 GB of system memory, and a 400 GB mechanical\nhard drive. During rendering tests, in one fifteen-second\nperiod, the whole 73 timesteps from the first dataset are\nloaded at a low resolution and cached, after which the user\ncan cycle through the series at full film speeds, all while\nmoving around the data. If the user stops at any one frame the\nprogressive refinement resumes and a high-resolution view of\nthe data streams in. This demonstrates the ability to handle a\nlarge amount of data spread over many timesteps, while the\nother two datasets demonstrate the ability to handle a large\nnumber of particles per timestep. All of this happens at fully\ninteractive frame rates. Also demonstrated is the ability to\nactually fly in to the data, as shown in Figure 7.\n6 ACCURACY\nProjecting the particle geometry onto slabs provides an ap-\nproximation of the underlying detail. Our goal is to provide\nan approximation that provides a high-quality visualization\nwith few artifacts. We discuss errors due to both geometric\napproximation and real-time color filtering.\nGeometric Errors\nBy projecting the geometry onto a flat image, we introduce\nsampling artifacts at the pixel level. These artifacts are\ngreatly reduced by supersampling at a very high resolution\nand averaging neighboring pixels while keeping an alpha\nchannel to describe partially-covered pixels. When the pixels\n6\nFigure 7. Far and near views of two different dislocation\ndynamics datasets both containing approximately 20 million\ndata points rendered with the volumetric imposter based level\nof detail algorithm.\nare reprojected to novel views at runtime, they lack proper\nparallax, since the objects have all been flattened to a 2D\nsurface. This effect can be reduced by using more than six\nlook-at directions, but we find that the quality is acceptable\nwhen using six directions Also the parallax distortion is\nconsistent as the images switch from one direction to another,\nwhich gives the user a consistent experience. Besides giving\nan inconsistent visual feel of 3D parallax, the pixels are not\nreprojected to their exact 3D locations because the images\ndo not have per-pixel depth information. This can introduce\nocclusion artifacts, as small areas that should be visible will\nbe blocked, and areas that should be invisible will not be\nblocked. This error can be reduced be increasing the number\nof slicing planes 


but it is also not very problematic visually\nbecause the offsets errors are consistent with the eye motion.\nAnother error introduced by projecting geometry onto flat\nplanes is the lack self-occlusion as the view point changes.\nImagine two spheres which do not touch, one in front of the\nother, whose centers are less than a full diameter apart in\na direction orthogonal to the sampling view direction. The\nfront sphere will partially eclipse the other. From a novel\nview direction they will always appear to intersect, with the\nfront sphere on top. However, as the view changes, the front\nsphere should eclipse the back sphere in varying degrees,\nfrom hiding it completely, to both spheres being completely\nvisible. For random bits of geometry floating in space, this\nis not a problem in some statistical sense. However, real\napplications have structure to their geometry, such as particles\nthat live close to crystal lattice positions in some of the\ndata we have worked with. While this can be addressed\nby increasing the number of imaging slabs, more efficient\ntechniques are desirable.\nThese are the major geometric and rasterization limitations\nimposed by the sampling method Most of these errors occur\nat a sub-texel resolution, and are not obviously visible. As the\neyepoint gets extremely close to the approximated geometry\nthe errors become more obvious. However, the general visual\nlook is very plausible most of the time, especially when the\nzoom ratio is approximately one texel per one pixel in the\ndisplay.\n7. DISCUSSION\nEmpty space skipping\nIn order to facilitate empty space skipping, each image tile is\nanalyzed during preprocessing and the number of filled pixels\n\(alpha> 0 in a table in the\nheader of each texture volume file for easy access. When a\nvolume block is split and its eight children are created, the\nsum of all the visible pixels is added up. Any child whose\ntally is zero \(or below a small threshold split and they are excluded from frustum culling\ncomputation and rendering. While this allows for exclusion\nof empty nodes, methods for removal of smaller empty spaces\ninside each volume block is an important research avenue for\nfurther work.\n2D vs 3D Texture Usage\nIt was our decision early on to use axis-aligned 2D textures as\nopposed to using 3D texturing as it simplified certain aspects\nof the rendering and texture caching However, 3D textures\nwould give better intra-slab interpolation. It has been shown\nthat using multiple sets of 3D textures such that the third\ntexture axis is opposing the viewing direction can improve\nthe performance of rendering with 3D textures due to better\nmemory access patterns. Since our datasets are imaged in the\n6 principle directions to capture more features, it is already\nsetup to give the texture accessing order benefits. However\nthe use of 3D textures in multiresolution volume rendering is\ntangential to the core of this research.\nInteraction With Lighting and Other Scene Elements\nBecause the level of detail algorithm renders textures onto\nproxy geometry in space, the approximate depth of objects\nis maintained. The availability of depth allows the integration\nwith other scene objects preserving features such as occlusion\nand intersections as well as projected shadows. Furthermore,\nthe volume hierarchy lends itself to level of detail volume\nshadow mapping. The only elements that are missing from\nallowing full illumination strategies are surface normals.\nSince one of the goals is to allow the visualization when\nmany objects occupy a single pixel, surface normals may\nnot be meaningful. However, strategies exist for representing\ndistributions of surface normals such as [14] which might\nbe appropriate for at least some of the levels of detail.\nOther precomputed lighting approximations, such as ambient\nocclusion, are another viable option that could work with the\nlevel of detail system.\nTexture Boundaries\nIt is necessary to place multiple texture tiles into larger tex-\ntures in the cache in order to improve performance. Because\nthe cache is set associative, neighboring tiles in the cache\nhave no pre-determined spatial coherence. Extra care must be\ntaken to avoid texture interpolation between tiles in the cache.\nTwo options exist for handling this correctly. Adding pixels\nto expand the borders of each image tile and then constricting\nthe texture coordinates will prevent interpolation between\nadjacent tiles, with the cost of wasted texture space. Using\nnearest neighbor sampling instead of linear interpolation will\nalso prevent texture access across tiles but reduces the overall\nquality of the renderings. In the test implementation the latter\nchoice was implemented, and therefore image quality could\nbe improved by using the former choice.\n7\nFigure 8. Five timesteps from the simulation showing multiple structures only a few particles thick The prefiltered textures\nproduce high-quality images. Furthermore each of these timesteps took less than two seconds to load.\n8. CONCLUSION\nAn algorithm for the visualization of time-varying, massive,\nunstructured data sets is presented. This algorithm allows\nsubpixel features to be captured while exploring gigabyte-\nsize data sets at interactive rates on commodity hardware.\nThe progressive texture hierarchy allows the user to quickly\nchange timesteps, playing back the entire time sequence at\nvideo rates, and to freeze time and interrogate any individual\ntimestep in greater detail as higher resolution textures pro-\ngressively load.\nThe presented approach scales from stand alone laptops to\nhigh-end workstation, allowing unstructured data made up\nof objects that exist at sub-pixel sizes to be displayed and\ninterrogated on the fly. The high quality of 


the pre-filtered\ntextures produce better representations of the underlying data\nthan direct rendering at zoomed out views and allows the\ndesired high-resolution detail to be streaming in at close\nviews.\nDue to the organization of the image tiles, a large numbers of\ntiles can be addressed at a cost related to the number of tiles\nloaded instead of the number of tiles in the whole dataset.\nBecause of this, an extremely large volume can be generated,\nand for an arbitrary number of timesteps. In our test system,\nwe generated 16 gigapixel volumes, which is 96 gigapixels\nper timestep, for nine timesteps and 2 gigapixel volumes for\n73 timesteps Figure 8 presented is straightforward to\nimplement and easily supports out-of-core rendering for very\nlarge datasets Furthermore, the preprocessing can take full\nuse of the GPU and be integrated with existing rendering\nsystems.\nThough the algorithm was presented in the context of particle\nvisualization, it would be useful for many types of complex\nor unstructured data where more traditional simplifications\nfail. The ability to capture features and occlusion at sub-pixel\nlevels with directional context should be a contribution useful\nto many applications. Furthermore, the lightweight rendering\nsystem that makes visualization achievable on commodity\nsystems is a blessing for research domains where computa-\ntional resources are limited.\n9. FUTURE WORK\nWe would like to investigate different pixel representation\nmethods in hopes of reducing the types of approximation\nerrors that occur. We believe that with the flexibility of\nmodern shader languages we should be able to encode certain\ntypes of error correction information in our texture maps.\nFurthermore, we would like to explore more image storage\nmethods, with hopes of more compactly representing the\nempty regions in the image data. We also believe that a run-\ntime occlusion query system could help reduce the number of\ntextures that need to be loaded during run time, as significant\nregions of the data can become completely occluded.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank Lawrence Livermore National Labo-\nratory for providing the atomistic datasets.\nThis work was performed in part under the auspices of the\nU.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
