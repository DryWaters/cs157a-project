 arctan   9 the longitude of the site at Cartesian coordinates \(x,y centered on the pole.  The equation uses the variable L1 for the longitude where the horizon mask crosses \226   L sin 0 0       212     212 002 else 0 1 1 1  xy 212 005  t 004   004 L  DTE L  002   t  005  002 212  Hp d R     7  Comparing these theoretical e quations with the computed illumination and DTE communications averages required using an adjusted lunar reference altitude at the poles.  The lunar reference geoid radius of 1738 km is not a good average value for the terrain at either pole.  The lunar south pole is part of the Aitken Basin, and the GSSR Digital Elevation Model elevations ha ve an average of -1880 m within 200 km of the south pole.  The lunar north pole region has an average elevation of -1673 m within 150 km of the north pole.  These averag es were subtracted from base site reference altitude to get the value of \221h\222 used in equation 2.  This effectively gaves the base sites a higher elevation relative to the local average elevation  For selected base sites, solar illumination and DTE communications averages were computed for tower heights from 2 m to 1500 m, and in some cases 3000 m.  Then these tower heights plus adjusted altitudes and base locations were used in equations 1 through 7 to get predicted values of the yearly average metrics.  The results are shown in figures 14 and 15.  Figure 14 shows black curves of equation 5 plotted parametrically with distance from the pole.  For the selected sites, the computed yearly average solar illumination is shown by squares, connected by a dashed line with the theoretical yearly average for the same location and tower heights The theoretical values are marked with X\222s.  South lunar Pole sites are in blue and the lunar north pole sites are in red.  The plots show reasonable agreement of computed values and theory, with the computed value never exceeding the theoretical.   Figure 15 shows black curves of equation 7 plotted parametrically with distance from the pole.  Th e value of L0 was set to zero for the parametric curves.  Fi gure 15 include computed and theoretical values of the yearly average DTE communications for the same sites as figure 14, using the same symbol and color conventions  At no site will a tower of 1500 m or less provide both 100 average yearly solar illumination and 100% average DTE communications.  Towers of 1500 m at sites NB and NC will raise the average yearly solar illumination to 100 But for the lunar south pole sites, like B1, towers of over 2500 m are required to rais e the average yearly solar illumination to 100%.  This is because the peaks Malapert 002 peaks  t\002 1  212  0 1 4 R      6  The yearly average Earth co mmunications, DTE, is then given by the equation        L L  L L Hm R  8  The obscuring effect of these p eaks is also shown in figure 5, where the peak Malapert t 006 002    L  2 cos 180 abs 180 sin 006 212 003 003  002 latitude These variables are   003  and Leibnitz 002 obscure the view of the sun from the lunar south pole.  Equation 8 gives the elevation, Hp, above a spherical surface needed to see the winter sun over a peak of elevation Hm at a distance, d from the pole.  Equation 8 provided values in Figures 4 and 14 for the Malapert 003 and Leibnitz 212 003 is at +10 degrees azimuth  Figure 15 shows the yearly average DTE communication varies more with distance fr om the pole toward the prime meridian that with tower height above the local terrain Towers up to 3000 m at the poles do not make significant improvements in the DTE co mmunications average.  The computed yearly average DT E communications for site NG exceed the predicted values fo r towers between 32 and 1500 meters tall.  This is because the view northward from site NG toward the Earth looks across the floor of Byrd Crater which averages about -2500 m elevation  Considerations for Photovoltaic Array Design  The lunar pole sites create some difficult challenges for designing a continuously operating photovoltaic power system.  A site with continuous solar illumination will see the Sun travel through 360 degrees of azimuth during 1 synodic month.  A photovoltaic power system would require several permanently mounted photovoltaic arrays pointed in several directions, or would have to continually track the Sun with a single array.  Sin ce a single array requires much less mass, the design of the solar tracking system is examined here  The requirement to continually track the Sun could be met by installing the photovoltaic array on a vertical axle oriented parallel to the lunar spin axis.  At the lunar south pole, this axle would rotate counterclockwise with the Sun to keep the array normal to the solar radiation.  This requires a foundation to support the axle cross beam structures to hold the array on the axle, and a drive system to turn the array.  This system also requires a solution to the \221cable wrap\222 problem, in order to continually track the Sun.  After 1 synodic month the array has turned through 360 degrees and needs to continue rotating in the same direction.  Power and control cables from the array need to go through multiple slip rings, or the array needs to rotate 360 degrees clockwise to unwrap the cables.  A slip ring design is further complicated by the requirement to tolerate the fine dust on    arccos 004  005  b t cos if 


  10 the lunar surface.  Using the \221cable unwrap\222 method means stopping power production for a short amount of time, once per synodic month  A heliostat design using a focusing mirror may provide a low-mass solution to the \221cable wrap\222 problem [Ref 10   Figure 16 shows a photovoltaic array installed horizontal to the local terrain.  A parabolic section mirror is installed above the array, angled at approximately 45 degrees to the local horizontal.  This mirror is suspended from the crossbar of a mast placed next to the array.  The mast could also be the structure for the Lunar Co mmunications Terminal \(LCT antennas.  The mirror is suspe nded from an axle that is oriented parallel to the lunar spin axis and rotates once per synodic month to continually reflect solar radiation onto the array.  The mirror can continue to track after 360 degrees revolution, since there are no cables attached to the moving part.  This heliostat \221periscope\222 design provides continuous solar tracking, but is partially shaded once per revolution when the Sun passes behind the support mast  Shaping the mirror into a para bolic arc concentrates solar power for a small increase in mass.  The tradeoffs should consider the relative mass-perunit area of the mirror and the photovoltaic panels, the reflectivity of the mirror material and the relative masses of an array-support axle versus a mirror heliostat axle plus mast  Additional flat \221periscope\222 mirrors mounted on the crossbar could be used to direct solar light to areas nearby.  This provides an efficient method of lighting work areas because it bypasses the inefficiencies of the photovoltaic system battery storage, and electric lighting.  If the photovoltaic power system is located on a crat er rim \(as in Figure 16\a flat \221periscope\222 mirror could provide continuous lighting to exploration crews in the perman ently shadowed areas within the crater.  Sufficiently large heliostat mirrors could redirect enough sunlight to run photovoltaic arrays at remote locations.  This would provide very efficient power transfer for operating within the permanently shaded areas  5  C ONCLUSIONS   Separating the lunar pole solar illumination problem into terrain horizon mask and solar motion computations simplified the production of illumination metrics.  Using a simplified model of average solar motion allowed quick comparisons between lunar south pole sites.  The results show that within 100 km of the lunar south pole, solar illumination is maximized at previously identified site locations.  These sites are small areas on the peaks of isolated mountains and crater rims.  No site provides 100 yearly average for both solar illumination and DTE communication.  Lunar north pole sites were also examined No site at either pole prov ides 100% yearly average for solar illumination unless a tower at least 1500 m is placed on one of the best lunar north pole sites  The best lunar south pole sites are on the rim of Shackleton crater, and the ridge west of Sh ackleton crater.  These 3 sites have yearly average of solar illumination between 93 and 97%.  The Sites have 100% solar power generation capability about 85 to 92% of the year.  For both of these metrics, Site B1 on the ridge West of Shackleton crater has the highest solar illumination values.  Site B1 has direct-toEarth visibility of the entire Earth disk about 51% of each month.  More detailed analysis of site B1 can use the terrain horizon masks presented here, coupled with more detailed true-of-date solar motion computations  Examination of the site solar illumination profiles at 40meter resolution shows the peaks of illumination are distributed over many points.  The locations with greater than 80% solar illumination are spread over 100s of meters This supports the conclusion that the Digital Elevation Model has adequate sampling to show the true terrain characteristics  The lunar north pole base sites NB and NC have yearly average solar illumination around 97%, and have 100 solar power generation capability about 88 to 92% of the time for the average year  The yearly average for 100% DTE communications at the best lunar north pole and south pole sites are all around 50%.  The yearly average DTE communications does not vary significantly with tower height, but does increase to 100% for sites about 100 km from the poles toward the lunar prime meridian 6  A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  The author expresses thanks to Martin A.
