much attention mainly due to their scalability The common CCF recommendation models are Markov modesl sequential association rules association rules and clustering The models have shown the trade-off relationship between precision and recall in performance To address the trade-off relationship some study has combined two or more different models or applied multiorder models The increase of recommendation effectiveness by these models is also at best marginal To increase recall while minimizing the loss of precision and 
therefore to increase overall performance measured by the F value we build a sequentially applied model SAM by applying the individual models in tandem in an order determined through a learning process We evaluated SAM over the individual models with Web usage data and the result is promising 1 Introduction Collaborative Filtering CF is a technology of making use of peers evaluations or behaviors for a personalized recommendation  Depen di n g on dat a t y p e 
in use for CF it can be classified into either user-based CF or item-based CF   Us erbas ed C F employs user data such as user profiles to find the most similar users or a reference group for a user and based on their preferences it recommends items for the user Itembased CF employs item data such as products or Web pages to find item relationships based on which it recommends items for a user User-based CF has been extensively used in research 
and in practice However it has a limitation in scalability 10 6 0 1  T rad itional user-based CF e.g KNearest Neighborhood  does most of recommendation computation in online real time For example from the user-item matrix in Figure 2 its online computational complexity is O mn  in the worst case because it needs to scan all the users once to find similar users and scan all the items to find the items that the similar users have 
selected B ecau s e s o m e ty pical electron ic com m erce EC sites have millions of customers and items this online computation complexity becomes a problem 16  2 0   A ltho ugh so m e statistical m e tho d s such as sampling or clustering can mitigate the online computational complexity these methods reduce recommendation quality 16  F o r instance cluster ing performs much of its computation offline but there are chances that the m ost similar user found in the closest 
cluster is not truly the most similar user 16  T his is illustrated using a simple clustering in Figure 1  Figure 1 A bad clustering example Item-based CF can have heavier computation than user-based CF but the heavy computation is performed in offline batch process The batch process usually builds recommendation models with which online recommendation is made so this item-based CF is called model-based CF T h i s m a k e s i t s on l i n e c om pu t a t i o n 
lighter than user-based CF So the scalability problem can be overcome For this reason item-based CF has received much attention as a way of doing CF In practice Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology \(CECê05 1530-1354/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


Amazon.com which has tens of millions of customers worldwide and millions of products is using item-based CF F rom Figure 2  its offline computational complexity could be O n 2 m  in the worst case i.e n C 2 m  For an item i it scans all the users and it calculates item similarities for the rest of the items  1,2,..i-1,i+1 n by using m dimensional user space This process is repeated up to n-1  Its online computation complexity is O n in the worst case but on average the complexity is O  constant  because the online computation is just to look at the constant number of items for an item i.e the number of the related items is very small or it recommends only TOP N items Item 1 Item 2  Item n User 1    User 2        User m      selection or purchase of an item by a user Figure 2 A user-item matrix Clickstream-based CF CCF a kind of item-based CF  h a s receiv ed m u ch atten tion as a w ay of doing collaborative filtering recommendation in Web navigation because user data is generally not available IP addresses may be used as implicit user identifications Like other item-based CF CCF needs to adopt prediction models for efficient and effective recommendations of pages or products due to its vast amount of data stream to process it trains the models offline and uses them in online recommendations Unlike other item-based CF recommendations i.e market basket data in EC the sequence of pages is important for its recommendation quality due to the fact that the sequential structure is embedded through the hyperlinks in Web pages Clickstream-based CF recommendation has its importance in EC because it could customize Web sites with relevant pages or recommend relevant products to increase user experience That is from browsing patterns we can know a userês product preference and then recommend relevant pages or products     Many studies have worked on CCF recommendation models using browsing patterns and their performance The common models for CCF recommendation are Markov models          sequential association rules      association rules      an d c l u s t eri n g 4][11][30][32 The contribution of this paper is as follows 1 it proposes a hybrid model SAM which applies the individual models in sequence SAM increases recall and the F value while keeping the loss of precision at minimum To the best of our knowledge SAM is the first hybrid model that applies different model types in sequence and 2 we show the performance of the hybrid model SAM mathematically and experimentally In the next section we present our motivation In section 3 we propose a new CCF recommendation model and in the following section we evaluate the proposed model in experiment and present its results And then we discuss related work Finally we make a conclusion with some possible future work 2 Motivation Markov models MM have been well positioned as a CCF recommendation model because of its high precision coming from the consideration of consecutive orders of preceding pages However this high precision comes at the cost of low coverage because the clickstream data is inherently sparse and MM cannot cover the sparse data well Markov models generally have high precision and low coverage In order to address this lower coverage and recall multi-order mixed Markov models have been devised T h e All K-th order Markov model  i s one example This applies the highest order first to predict a next page or product If it cannot predict the page it keeps decreasing the order one by one until it can recommend the next page or product i.e cover a current active clickstream  T h is can in creas e t h e cov erag e and recall of the model but the increase could be still marginal for some applications e.g cross-selling in EC where recall is more important Association rules AR are based on the relationship of co-occurrences of pages or products without considering the sequence of them  T h e cooccurrences may represent diverse multidirectional semantic relationships between pages G irl vs woman similar and male vs female opposite are the examples for all possible relationships refer to    Association rules have been applied for finding frequent product sets in EC The frequent product sets are used for recommending products There is no order consideration This makes AR generally produce low precision but high recall in the prediction Association rules first identify large frequent page or product sets from a training data set using a support threshold i.e minsupport in T h en  f or each active path i.e antecedent in a test set it identifies frequent sets containing the active path From the identified frequent sets it recommends pages or products in the order of their confidence  In order to increase the coverage on the test set with the training set the size of the active path can be decreased one by one recursively until the path is covered by the training set Association Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE

rules performance also varies depending on the threshold values of support and confidence which should be set in advance before training 14  A high thr e sho l d v a lue would result in higher precision and lower recall while a low threshold value would result in lower precision and higher recall There is no good way to a priori select optimal values of support and confidence Therefore AR may require an extensive learning experiment to find the optimal values 10  Sequential association rules SAR stand between MM and AR in that it considers the sequence of pages which is not necessarily contiguous and uses frequent sets for its recommendation as association rules do It is expected that SAR come between MM and AR in precision and recall Clustering alone may not be an appropriate approach for CCF It usually employs different feature sets such as contents or concepts   or l i n k s t r u c t u res 32 of pages or is used as a moderator in terms of computation with other models 12  3 2   T his statistical method is to partition pages or sessions into closely related subsets part of which is used for recommendation  it is possible to create clustering using all data set  Because it does not use all the pages directly but through the controlled clusters i.e the number of clusters and maximum and minimum sizes of clusters are set in advance itmaylose some accuracy C l u s terin g b as ed on th e f eatu re s ets like bit vector visit or non-visit 19  s p e nt tim e o r frequency does not partition pages or sessions well because those feature sets usually cannot capture well structural and semantic relationships between pages The prediction models for CCF show strengths and weaknesses in their performance due to the inherent tradeoff relationship between precision and recall Even the hybrid models 22  3 1  sho w their lim itatio ns in their performance increase especially recall because they mainly focus on increasing precision and apply only one model type at a prediction point Therefore it is always a research issue to find or devise a model addressing precision as well as recall Thus we are presenting a hybrid model SAM combining the individual models at model level to increase recall and the F value while minimizing the loss of precision at minimum 3 Proposed Work OnemaingoalinthisworkistodeviseanewCCF model that provides better recall and the F value over existing models Without using contents or the structure information a way to increase both coverage and recall while keeping the loss of precision at a minimum is to apply the individual models MM SAR and AR in tandem in an order presumably precision order decided through a learning proce ss Conceptual motivation is depicted in Figure 3  Since the prediction models show varying performance depending on a data set and the parameters such as the number of pages or items in recommendation window size minimum confidence and support the learning process is needed to decide the order in applying the individual models In Figure 3 the performance of the proposed model may be represented as the combined area of the three individual models Model h represents a model with the highest precision model l a model with the lowest precision and model m a model with the middle precision Each area i.e the product of precision and recall represents the performance of each model Because the models are applied sequentially and recall has a nondecreasing property we can build SAM that applies the models in tandem in an order In Figure 3  model h represents a model with the highest precision and the lowest coverage model l a model with the lowest precision and the highest recall and model m a model between model h and model l  The precision of SAM comes between the highest precision and the lowest precision of the member models but much more towards the highest precision since SAM is constructed with the individual models usually in their precision order Figure 3 The conceptual representation of the performance of the proposed model First with Figure 4  we can show by a simple calculation how the precision and recall of the proposed SAM position in comparison to the ones of the individual models From Figure 4 let P i be the precision of the individual model i where i  h  m or l  Let the total number of covered records A i be C i  W i If A i  a subset of the whole test set is large enough then the precision P i of each model from the whole data set can be represented as follows P i  C i  C i  W i here i  h  m or l P i  C i  R i 1 Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology \(CECê05 1530-1354/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


Then the precision P SAM of the proposed SAM is P SAM   i C i   i A i Basically the order of applying the individual models is determined through a learning process However for the sake of explanation Figure 4 assumes SAM constructed with the individual models applied in their precision order which is intuitive If individual models with lower precision are used first there is a chance that the individual model with the highest precision is not used for recommendation which makes the precision of SAM closer to the precision of the model l  Figure 4 The way of building SAM In order to know where the precision P SAM will be positioned compared to the precisions of the individual models letês first compare P SAM with P h  P h  P SAM  C h  A h  i C i   i A i  C h  i A i  A h  i C i  A h  i A i Since A h  A i  0 then we only need to decide the sign of the numerator to determine the order between P SAM and P h  C h  i A i  A h  i C i  C h A m  C h A l C m A h C l A h 2 From 1 C i  P i A i 3 Insert 3 into 2 P h A h A m  P h A h A l P m A m A h P l A l A h  A h A m P h P m A l A h P h P l  Since P h P m 0 and P h P l 0  P h  P SAM This means the precision of the model with the highest precision is always greater than the one of the proposed SAM This implies the decreasing nature of precision in SAM.Inthesameway,ifwecompare P SAM with P l P l  P SAM  C l  i A i  A l  i C i  A l  i A i The numerator is decomposed into A l A h  P l P h  A l A m  P l  P m  Since P l  P h 0and P l  P m 0  P l  P SAM This tells us that the precision of the model with the lowest precision is always less than the precision of the proposed SAM Let us compare P SAM with P m  P m  P SAM  C l  i A i  A l  i C i  A l  i A i In the same way we get the following numerator A l A m  P m P l  A m A h  P h P m  Let A l A m  P m P l  A m A h  P h P m  equal to 0 A l A m  P m P l  A m A h  P h P m   A l  A h  P h P m  P m P l  After transforming the numerator and removing A m from it the sign of the numerator depends on the ratio of two items A l  A h and  P h P m  P m P l  That is if the ratio of the number of records covered by the model l over the number of records covered by the model h is greater less than the ratio of the difference in precision between h and m over the difference in precision between m and l then P m is greater less than P SAM  If the two ratios are equal then P m is equal to P SAM  Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology \(CECê05 1530-1354/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

performance of the models by giving equal weights on precision and recall  Figure 6 Performance metrics 4.2 Experimental Results The performance of SAM was evaluated over varying TOP N values the number of pages recommended by a prediction model Depending on applications TOP N may vary In typical recommendations like in cross-selling in EC the TOP N could be relatively small e.g ten or so For the experiment the publicly available NASA Web access log data NJMC New Jersey Meadowlands Commission http://www.meadowlands.state.nj.us and CIMIC Center for Information Management Integration Connectivity http://cimic.rutgers.edu log data are used A data set is divided into training and test data sets by their dates such that the test data is the session data at later dates than the training data For example the experimental instance of Figure 7 used the NJMC Web server access log between January 01 2004 and February 19 2004 as a training data set and the access log between February 19 2004 and March 4 2004 as a test data set This experimental design reflects the fact that a recommendation for a current active session is based on the past session data The training data set of the instance contains a total of 5,453 session records and its average session length is 7.088 Its test data set contains a total of 939 session records and its average session length is 8.368 which is a little bit longer than the length of the training data probably due to the small size of the test data set As we increase the size of a data set its average session length decreases and vice versa Also as we changed the size of the test set with the size of the training set fixed the performance of SAM over the ones of the individual models is consistent in order The models the individual models plus SAMs in different combinations of the individual models are evaluated also with different parameter values of window size minimum confidence and minimum support etc because these parameters also affect the performance of the models With any given context SAM will be constructed with the individual models after a learning process The performance of SAM is better than at least is equal to the ones of other models in recall and the F measure while SAM keeps the loss of precision at minimum over the model with the highest precision As a part of the learning process the performances of all the other possible SAMs are also shown for comparison in Figure 7  We have tested about hundred trials with different combinations of data set and parameters All the tests support the mathematical proof presented in the section 3 the recall and the F measure of SAM are always greater than the ones of the individual models and its precision loss is minimum when the individual models are applied in their precision order For this instance MSAD applying MM SAR AR and a default model in that order is the best performing SAM The default model is the last model to be used when the other individual models do not cover the active session The default model recommends pages aka consequents or actions  in the order of their frequency from a whole data set Because it doesnêt use an antecedent at all its performance is not expected to be as good as the other individual models  T h e preci s i on of MM is the highest while its recall is almost the lowest It shows that SAR takes a position between MM and AR 5 Related Work Gundiz and Ozsu 13 b u ilt cluster s insid e w hich trees are constructed by using sequential association rules to predict Web pages Zuckerman et al bu i l t h y bri d models that combine variants of Markov models based on the time and/or structural sequences of pages Based on these hybrid Markov models they created a hybrid model that selectively chooses a best performing model at a prediction point Nakagawa and Mobasher als o proposed a hybrid model utilizing the site structure and the degree of local hyperlink connectivity The model selectively uses MM or AR based on the hyperlink connectivity measure of a page which affects the individual models precision These hybrid models apply only one model at a prediction point so that their performance increase is at best marginal Also the adoption of the structure information may limit the extension of the models into other domains for example the predictions of a service order 9  e d iting co m m a nd s i n Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology \(CECê05 1530-1354/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

Figure 5. Similarity curve with system in different states  The experimental results denote that we can find an ideal parameter-set by genetic algorithm. Using the 1991 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005  parameter-set in anomaly detection, we can differentiate normal state of the protected system from anomalous state to the largest extent. Obviously, the membership functions generated by the genetic algorithm is more efficient than those defined with experts  domain knowledge 5.  Conclusions and Future Work The goal of applying genetic algorithm in anomaly detection is to search ideal membership functions. The main advantage is that we can define membership function randomly without experts  domain knowledge. For an IDS genetic algorithm is applied only in system design. The optimized membership functions will be used directly in real-time detection, therefore the performance of IDS will not be influenced although genetic optimization is a time-consuming process Nevertheless, membership functions still need to be tuned constantly because that the normal state of protected system changes with time. We can adapt the normal profile characterized by rule-sets membership functions ultimately, and how to build an adaptive anomaly detection system by genetic algorithm or other intelligent methods will be investigated in future research References 1] Stefan Axelsson.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
