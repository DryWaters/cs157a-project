Evaluation of Risk Factors Selection in Cardiac Risk Stratification  E Yargholy 1,2 S Parvaneh 1,2   1 Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch, Tehran, Iran 2 Young Researchers Club, Tehran, Iran Abstract In the past few years a number of algorithms for cardiovascular risk stratification have been proposed to the medical community but a big question has been remained unsolved: From among alternative sets of cardiac risk factors which ones are more significant in cardiac risk stratification  In this paper a hybrid neurofuzzy classifier, IRIDIA Method for Neuro-fuzzy Identification and Data Analysis, was applied to determine the cardiac risk stratification. Using the obtained neuro-fuzzy model, sensitivity analysis of cardiac risk factors was derived to sort out cardiac risk factors according their significance - which factor has great effect on cardiac risk  1. Introduction The concept of cardiac risk factors has become an integral part of the modern medical curriculum and has led to the development of algorithms for cardiac risk assessment  Usually, the cardiac risk stratification methods in literature are either based on ECG data-driven or patient's medical data. The former includes QRS detection distances in time between wave s of RR, PR, and etc  A ge bl ood pre s s u re c hol e s t e rol a nd a r e  examples of the latter one 2 In the previously done researches, data have been measured, then several score sheets have been prepared accordingl  T he s e s c ore sheets can be applied to estimate people risk factor in general. The patient's data are scored by means of obtained score sheets Considering the scores, cardiac risk factor is calculated Framingham study is regarded as the earliest method in this era. The objective of Framingham heart study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease by following its development in the large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of cardiovascular disease or suffer a heart a ttack. The researchers went through medical history, extensive physical examination and laboratory tests Over the years careful monitoring of Framingham study population has led to the identification of major cardiovascular disease risk f actors, as well as valuable information on the effects of these factors such as blood pressure, blood triglyceride and cholesterol levels, age and gender [7 The use of scoring systems to stratify cardiac risk is currently hampered by method ological and mathematical flaws. Newer approaches ma ke use of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks, linke d to artificial intelligence Applying neuro-fuzzy method, the present study seems to initiate a new approach toward cardiac risk stratification So far, a lot of numeric analysis approaches of neurofuzzy systems have been presented. Most of these techniques divide the input data space, not considering the output data space, so the obtained rules should not be always reasonable. IRIDIA method is a simple and effective neuro-fuzzy network that divides input-output data space and extracts fuzzy if-then rules automatically This method searches for the right number of rules of the architecture by adopting a pr ocedure of cross-validation on the available data set   9       To aim at excellent fuzzy modeling, it is necessary to select adequate input el ements. Unnecessary inputs interfere with proper learning inference, and creation of efficient rules [10 S e n s i t i vi t y a n a l ys i s o f c a rd i a c ri s k  factors was derived by using the obtained fuzzy rules in order to show which factor has great effect on cardiac risk. When the factors are uncertain, and/or there are alternative sets of factors to choose from, the model output will also be uncertain. Quantitative sensitivity analysis tries not only to identify but also to quantify the relative significance of the factors [1 S e l e c t i on of  efficient input elements can c ontribute to the performance improvement, reduction of calculation cost and analysis of the obtained rules that is one of the important merits of fuzzy system  ISSN 0276-6574 665 Computers in Cardiology 2008;35:665-668 


  2. Database The present article develops a simplified cardiac risk factor model, building on the sex, age, cholesterol \(LDL and blood pressure. Family history for heart disease physical activity, obesity, cigarette smoking, diabetes and are not included because thes e factors work to a large extent through a major risk factors, and their unique contribution to cardiac risk factor assessment can be difficult to quantify [12 4  Statistic data of 165 patients in hospitals of Tehran 54 patients\ and Shiraz \(111 patients 1 were gathered The data included the following variables: sex, age, LDL blood pressure, and Myocard-brain Creatinine Phosphokinase \(cpk-mb\nzyme. The intensity of infarction was determined according to the amount of the enzyme \(in three different levels: no infarction, mild infarction, and severe infarction 3 Idea and method Sex, age, LDL, and blood pressure were considered as the input and infarction intensity was considered as the output           Fig. 1.  Assessment system  To draw the input-ou tput mapping of each group neuro-fuzzy networks were used. Having obtained a neuro-fuzzy model, we estimated the significance of input variables in making output with the use of Linkens method \(Fig. 1  3.1 Cardiac risk stratification At first step, in this study all the input variables including age, LDL blood pressure were normalized in the range of [0,1 u t p u t va l u e s o f no  i n fa rc t i on   m i l d  infarction, and severe infarction based on enzyme concentration are identified w ith numerical values of 0 0.5 and 1 respectively. Then the data related to men women, men-Shiraz, women-Shiraz, men-Tehran, and   1 Tehran and Shiraz are two big cities in Iran which are far away from each other  women-Tehran were partitioned into train and test sets randomly \(both sets included subjects with no infarction subjects with mild infarction as well as subjects with severe infarction\ %70 of whole data was used for training \(rule generation\nd the rest %30 was used for testing. IRIDA method was applied to data sets of men women, men-Shiraz, women-Shiraz, men-Tehran, and women-Tehran  IRIDIA Method The precise model of TakagiSugeno selected to be used as the fuzzy model. The program provided a set of structural alternatives in the definition of the fuzzy model: the shape of membership function of the antecedents \(Gaussian/triangular\he parametric form of the consequent \(constant/linear\he combination method of the rules \(weighted/comb\nd bias term which can be either used or not in the linear step of the nonlinear parametric optimization \(bias/nobias\urther, it is possible to choose between two different clustering policies, K-means/Hyperplane fuzzy clustering [15 t o pro v i d e t h e i d e n t i fi c a t i o n a l g o ri t h m  with good initial values of the center and base of the membership functions. Then we obtained 32 models for each data set Gaussian/Triangular,Cons tant/Linear,Weighted/Comb Bias/No-bias,K-means/Hyperplane IRIDIA method searches for the right number of rules of the architecture by adopting a procedure of crossvalidation on the available data set. It starts with a minimal number of rules and at each step increases the number of rules by restarting the global procedure until a maximum number of rules is reached \(the user is free to set properly what is the desired range of number of rules to range over\hen each struct ure is characterized by its error in generalization, estimated by a procedure of crossvalidation and the optimal number of rules is searched by comparing the cross-validation error obtained at different levels of number of rules. At the end of the global training phase, the cross-valid ation error is plotted against the number of rules used and the user is asked to choose the number of rules at which the fuzzy system looks to perform better \(Fig. 2 In order to have a definite range for the number of rules, points with coordinates of \(blood pressure, LDL age\ere exhibited in a 3dimentional space. Therefore regarding the distribution of data a range of 3-10 was chosen. For each of 32 fuzzy structures cross-validation error versus number of rules was plotted and number of those rules was chosen that produces the least crossvalidation error Selecting the fuzzy model, the number of rules was determined. The model was trained by the train set data Sex Age LDL Blood pressure Neuro-fuzzy classifier Infarction intensity Evaluation of risk factors selection 666 


  The trend was repeated for the 32 fuzzy structures  Fig. 2.  Cross-validation error versus number of rules diagram  In these phase, we used the trained fuzzy model to predict data output of train and test sets data. Considering the number of errors, we chose the most appropriate model Applying IRIDIA method led us to consider a distinction between males and females in cardiac risk stratification. Males and females were studied separately because they differ according to the age at which there is risk of infarction, but in the case of blood pressure and LDL, the differences are not considerable The results of the study directed us to regard subjects of different cities separately. Since life quality and conditions such as air pollution, life style and … differ in these two cities, so risk ranges of different age, LDL, and blood pressure levels are not the same in different cities and various adaptive strategies can be tuned up in terms of a specific population to st ratify the risk of cardiac disease  Table 1 Fuzzy models of IRIDIA method  Results of different groups of our research are summarized in Table 1.  Total error is the proportion of error numbers to the total number of data Tehran women data, in our database, was not enough to be applied to IRIDIA method 3.2  Evaluation of risk factor significance In this research, we used Linkens [1  1 7 m e t hod t o  compute input significance Since this method has to know the set of proper rules in advance, we first chose the neuro-fuzzy model and then computed the input significance Suppose that the dimension of the data, is  N 1   the number of rules, is N 2 and the dimension of the output data, is  N 3 The input data is expressed as follows   U= \(u 1 u 2 u 1 N  The subscripts i, j, and k refer to the input, the rule, and the output respectively. u ij is the membership value and w ij is the center value of the membership function. The logical form of the fuzzy inference if-then rules is given such as : if u 1 is j w 1 and …, u i is ij w u 1 N is j N w 1  is then y k is jk w Where ij w means the value near w ij  The lth input significance value is calculated z l ik    2 2 N j ij N j ik ij u w u  1 Next, the integrated input significance value from the ith input to the kth output is calculated using L sets of z l ik R ik  l max z l ik  l min z l ik 2 R k  i max R ik   3 Finally, the syntactic input significance value is calculated by accumulating F ik  F i   3 N k ik F 4 4  Results With regards to table 2, it can be concluded that cardiac risk factor significan ce differs in terms of gender and regional conditions The significance of input variables \(blood pressure LDL, and age\as approximately the same. So our input set has been appropriate and there is no need to decrease the number of variables or change them. Age, blood pressure and LDL, input variables, were sorted out according their significance resp ectively.

  of this study, the significance degree of a risk factor can be defined according to a specific population and specific region Table 2 Significance of input variables  For further research, additional risk factors, not available in patients' record s at the present, can be included to provide the me dical community with a comprehensive program which shows the risk factors significance in a hierarchical order 5. Conclusion In this paper we explained cardiac risk factor stratification based on a neur o-fuzzy classifier, IRIDIA method. Our Parameters consisted of sex, age, LDL, and blood pressure. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine: the resemblance of this model with the process under study, the quality of model definition factors that mostly contribute to the output variability and interaction between factors The capabilities of our method can be summarized as below More Risk factor, smoking background, life condition, obesity, diabetes, and … can be applied in the proposed method Extension of available data in database simply can be integrated in our model. Also, Extension of database with more data can yield more reliable results Using this method, risk factor assessment can be specialized based on different regions and life conditions Defining the most effectiv e factor, in each special population, prevention strategies can be adopted Risk factor can be compar ed in different populations and differences can be derived  References 1  Assmann G, Cullen P, Schulte H.

eliminates the energy waste of idle listening Another advantage of this scheduling algorithm is the mitigation of interference between concurrent communication pairs Consequently both energy and communication efficiency are maximized A GPS receiver at every node accommodates both synchronization and deformation measurements During active periods when bandwidth demands are highest the network will prioritize the information flow in the network and reserve the bandwidth for high-priority data based on mission-needs For instance if during volcanic activity gas measurements are deemed highest priority other data may be buffered to make more bandwidth available for gas data Cluster coordinators will be able to automatically identify and select the minimum set of sensors that will provide mission critical data Bayesian network techniques will be applied to address the sensor selection problem 14 To further optimize bandwidth utilization in-situ data reduction compression and aggregation will be driven by science requirements For example when necessary seismic data typically recorded at 100Hz will be reduced by two orders of magnitude at the node level by reporting an average Real-time Seismic Amplitude Monitor RSAM parameter which is an established measurement of both earthquake and volcanic tremor 15 In addition continuous seismic data will be streamed into a buffer at each node and when seismic events are triggered the buffered waveform with precise time markers will be compressed and delivered to the control center for higher level processing Power management The main challenge facing the power management of almost all wireless networks and in particular a volcano sensor-web is striking a balance between the need for high-rate data and the desire for network longevity The smart sensor node will have a builtin ability to adjust transmission power according to local density A dynamic transmission range setting algorithm 712 will be developed to maximize energy and communication efficiency in the network which is also part of the topology management algorithm To solve the problem that the nodes closer to the gateway consume more power and might die earlier we will investigate the possibility of deploying some relay nodes to relay messages for sensors so that the sensors lifetime can be prolonged Moreover the OASIS bandwidth management scheme will have an added benefit as it will establish a timeoptimum communication schedule as well as a cooperative power schedule of sensors Since each node alternates between reception/transmission and sleep states the energy waste of idle listening and contention will be eliminated in normal operation We are currently evaluating our innovative localized TDMA MAC protocols and have shown super performances in simulations Test-bed sensor node development The staff of the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory will design prototype and test the data acquisition sensors and communication hardware for the in situ sensor nodes As part of this design process early input from geodesists and seismologists will be incorporated to ensure appropriate sensors and capabilities are included Use of commercial off-the-shelf COTS embedded microcontroller modules with high level programmability is planned to enable rapid development and application of an affordable platform An expansion circuit and printed wiring board will be designed and produced that will include power conditioning and control sensor input multiplexing signal conditioning signal digitization and communications interfaces COTS sensors will include an LI GPS receiver for timing and deformation monitoring seismic accelerometer microphone or microbarograph for infrasonic detection of explosions and emissions lightning detector for ash cloud detection and other sensors such as SO2 gas as deemed appropriate by scientific design criteria Telemetry between nodes will be IEEE 802.15.4 and 900 MHz ISM spread spectrum as appropriate for the specific link requirements In an active volcano we can not rely on solar panel for energy because it will be covered by snow in winter and erupting ash in summer In our hardware package design each station consumes less than 2W power With several Air-Alkaline batteries our network is designed to survive for one year without solar panels 5 OASIS SPACE SEGMENT The OASIS will demonstrate the benefits of a feedback between ground and space operations This capability is essential for two reasons  It will make for more efficient operation of the in-situ element  It will trigger an in-situ deployment or enhancement at an unmonitored or poorly monitored volcano and will be able to ingest input as it gradually appears online Just as the in-situ component requires a scalable architecture so will the OASIS space element be designed to accommodate future space and in-situ observations as they come on-line NASA's Earth Observing system already includes an array of sensors relevant to volcano monitoring Table 2 each with its own data system and interfaces In order to create a common interface to each of these heterogeneous systems the OASIS will develop and implement the Open Geospatial Consortium Sensorweb Enablement SWE services for space and in-situ sensors to task and acquire observation data Table 2 Current and future volcano
