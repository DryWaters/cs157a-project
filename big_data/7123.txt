Abstract i.e 
Trust of a software system   the degree of conìdence that a system conforms to its speciìcation can be deìned in terms the composition of trust values for each individual software component or service used in the creation 
of that software system and their interaction patterns This paper therefore presents the different composition patterns and the common associations between various quality-of-service QoS properties of the composed system for the identiìed composition patterns It also presents composition rules for deriving systemic trust values for each composition pattern Lastly results from applying the composition patterns to a case study show our trust composition model can predict trust of a composed system with 55%Ö70 uncertainty that increases with system complexity

Trust of a composed system can be evaluated by aggregating the trust of functional and quality-of-service QoS properties   response time availability and conìdentiality that the system is expected to hold A single property of a system can either be a boolean assertion   conìdentiality or a keyvalue pair   response time The trust value of a single property can be derived based on trust values for the corresponding property from each the individual service involved 
A Interaction Patterns of Properties e.g e.g e.g 
in the composition The composition of the individual service properties to create the systemic value however depends on the nature of the property and the interaction pattern  
how the services interact with each other of the software services in the composition QoS is known to be a N-dimensional space b ut in this paper we focus on the following QoS properties of software systems   the length of time it take a client to send a request to a server and receive a response for the

relationships and the corresponding trust operators for predicting the trust of the composition from the trust of individual services More speciìcally the trust about a property of a service deìned as 1 If the service is composed of individual services  then property of the service is evaluated as a function of for the individual services This function is called the composition operator and is deìned as 2 As shown in Equation 2 depends on and the interaction pattern between individual services The trust of a property in the service depends on and is deìned by the trust composition operator where 3 If  then the composed system will have property  if there exists a service that satisìes property  Likewise the corresponding trust operator for this composition is the disjunction operator For example availability in the discriminator pattern illustrates usage of the existential operator because when one service as the availability property then the composed system also has the availability property If  then the composed system will have property  if all its services hold property  Likewise the corresponding trust operator for this composition is the conjunction operator For example conìdentiality in the sequence pattern illustrates usage of the universal operator because all services in the composed system must have the conìdentiality property for the composed system to have the conìdentiality property If or  then the value of property of the composed system is the minimum or maximum value respectively of property out of all services used in the composition For example response time in the discriminator pattern illustrates usage of the minimum operator because the response time of the composed system is equal to the minimum response time of the participating services Similarly response time in the split/join pattern illustrates usage of the maximum operator because the response time of the composed system is equal to the maximum response time of the participating services If the property is a boolean assertion then the minimum or maximum operator is equivalent to the universal operator In this situation or  If the property is not a boolean assertion   a key-value pair such as response time then must rely on distributions of the different values for  For example response time is a key-value pair property and example values can be 10 msecÑthe mean value for the distribution of observed response times Assuming that two separate services   and  exhibit the response time distributions above then the trust value for of the composed system can be calculated by using probability theory and the corresponding minimum or maximum operator to join each serviceês probability distribution The resulting joined probability distribution is then used to calculate the trust of for the composed system If  then the value of property for the composed service system is the sum of the property for all services used in the composition For example response time in the sequence pattern illustrates usage of the addition operator because the response time of a composed system is equal to the sum of the response times of the participating services assuming that each services is running on its own host and there is no competition for CPU resources on the host If is a binary assertion then the addition operator is equivalent to the existential operator see above In this situation If is not a boolean assertion   a key-value pair such as response time then must rely on distributions of the different values for For example response time is a key-value pair property and an example value can be 10 msecÑthe mean value for the distribution of observed response times Assuming that two separate services   and  exhibit the response time distributions above then the trust value for of the composed system can be calculated by using probability theory and the corresponding addition operator to join each serviceês probability distribution The resulting joined probability distribution is then used to calculate the trust of for the composed system If  then the value of property for the composed system is the product of property for each service used in the composition For example availability in the sequence pattern illustrates usage of the multiplication operator because the availability of a composed system is equal to the multiplication of the availabilities of the participating services If is a boolean assertion then the multiplication operator is equivalent to the universal operator see above because both produce the same results In this situation  If the property is not a boolean assertion   a key-value pair such as response time then must rely on distributions of the different values for  For example response time is a key-value pair property and example values can be 10 msecÑthe mean value for the distribution of observed response times Assuming that two separate services   and  exhibit

value of property for the composed system   is equal to the multiplication of the property that participate in the composition   with some constant multiplier  We denote this as  For example response time in the loop pattern illustrates usage of the multiplier operator because the response time of a composed system in loop pattern is equal to the response time of the participating service multiplied by the number of loops The application of the multiplier operator is equal to applying the addition operator to a service times The trust operator corresponding to the multiplier operator is therefore equivalent to applying trust operator corresponding to the addition operator times For example if the response time of a service is 15ms and is composed in a loop pattern of 10 iterations then the response time of the composed service is 150 msec assuming that there is no competition for CPU resources on the host in each iteration If the trust of the participating service is very high then the trust of the composed system can be obtained by applying the conjunction operator on the on the trust of the participating service times If  then the value of property for the composed system   will be equal to the exponential value of the property that participate in the composition with some constant exponent  We denote this as  For example availability in the loop pattern illustrates usage of the exponent operator because the availability of a composed system in loop pattern is equal to exponentiation of the availability of the participating service where the exponent is number of loops The application of exponent operator is equal to applying multiplication operator for to a service a constant number of times The trust operator corresponding to the exponent operator is therefore equivalent to applying the trust operator corresponding to the multiplication operator a constant number of times If  then the value of property for the composed system equals the value of for the non-deterministically selected service As shown in Equation 4 the application of composition operator for a set of services will give an expected value for equal to the probability that the individual service is selected 4 For example availability in the exclusive choice pattern illustrates usage of the non-deterministic operator because the availability of a composed system in exclusive choice is equal to the availability of a non-deterministically selected service The trust composition operator corresponding to the nondeterministic composition operator is found by applying both the recommendation operator and disjunction operator As shown in Equation 5 the probabilities of individual service being selected is expressed as a subjective logic expression where is the weight that service to be selected considering uncertainty also as a factor 5 If is the generative operator then the composed system will have the value of property if the condition in the context denoted as fthe composition is metÑeven if services do not have property  For example the conìdentiality property in the split/join pattern illustrates usage of the generative operator because by splitting user data ow at different levels   authorized users and non-authorized users the control and the data can be made conìdential Here the generative condition is the whether the communications of participating services are separated without any back-channels Lastly the trust composition operator corresponding to the generative operator is equal to the trust that the generative condition for the satiìed participating services The select operator is a transformational composition operator that has to be combined with another composition operator We denote the select operator as where is a condition that a subset of the participating services must satisfy When the select operator is present the relevant composition operator is applied only on the participating services that meet the given criteria For example authentication in the discriminator pattern illustrates usage of the select operator because the authentication of the composed system is equal to the authentication provided by the participating services with minimum response time The subset of available services can be selected using the criteria services having minimum response time When the select operator is applied to property with a composition operator  the trust of in the composed system is evaluated by applying the trust operator of the related composition operator on the set of services within the composition that hold the criteria For example the trust of the authentication of a composed system in discriminator pattern is calculated by applying the conjunction operator trust operator corresponding to the universal operator for the trust of selected services with minimum response times Lastly the trust operator is denoted as  The composition operators and trust operators depend on the interaction pattern between individual services in the system composition and the of the property under evaluation For example evaluating the response time of a system using services that exhibit the sequence interaction pattern requires using the addition operator Table I provides an overview of composition operators for common QoS properties with common interaction patterns As shown in Table I the universal operator is the composition operator for the conìdentiality and integrity QoS property is the irrespective of the observed interaction pattern This is because Mclean et al sho wed that these properties are preserved only when all the participating services have the separability property which is the ability to ensure that there are no interactions allowed between users at different authorization levels To preserve authorization and authenti

F Effect of Environment on Composition Operators e.g A Overview of the Indoor Tracking System 
Our current discussion assumes that the composition operators depend only on the property under evaluation and the interaction pattern of the composition The effect of the execution environment however is an important factor that must be considered when evaluating trust values of the composed system and its services For example if the runtime environment   the operating system is not trustworthy the fully trusted services that execute within the environment will not function as expected Any trust composition model therefore must be able to integrate trust of the runtime environment Building on Equation 2 we denote a service running in an environment as  and the property of the service that runs on the environment as  The composition operator for is denoted as  as shown in Equation 6 6 In most situations we can capture the environmentês effect on the composed system as service that participates in the composition We denote the environment as a service as  For example the network that host a set of services can be represented as a service and network delay and network bandwidth at the network serviceês QoS properties We can then reuse the environment independent composition operator to evaluate properties of the composition using the following equation Similarly we can extend Equation 3 to evaluate the trust of the composition while integrating the as follows 7 As shown in Equation 7 the trust of a property in the composed system is evaluated based on the trust of the property in the participating services and the environment For example if there are two services with response times 15 msec each and the overall network delay of the system is 5 msec then the response time of the composed system can be calculated by considering the network as another service with the response time of 5 msec The resulting response time therefore would be 35 msec assuming that each services is running on its own host and there is no competition for CPU resources on the host III C ASE S TUDY I NDOOR O BJECT T RACKING S YSTEM This section discusses how we applied the trust composition operators introduced in Section II to an indoor object tracking system to conceptually v alidate the proposed trust composition model The indoor object tracking system is a system that tracks the position of objects using a set of heterogeneous sensors It is also a SOA that is composed from the following services  Sensor services represent physical sensors that identify the location of the objects in the environment such as a laboratory or ofìce Examples of sensor services include but is not limited to camera services wireless network signal tracking services and Radio Frequency Identiìcation RFID services  The fusion service fuses the outputs of multiple heterogeneous sensor services and outputs a more accurate position of the tracked object based on the aggregation of information obtained from each sensor service  The discovery service selects the most appropriate sensor and fusion services that matches the userês functional and QoS requirements In this case study the discovery service selects the two sensor services that most accurately tracks objects while maintaining a low response time For the indoor tracking system we are concerned with evaluating the following QoS properties  Response time is how long it takes to system to return the position of the tracked object Because the objectês position can change over time it is important that response time be low as low as possible to ensure the obtained position is up-to-date

Error of tracked position is the distance between the actual object position and the position provided by the tracking system The error should be as low as possible to increase the indoor object tracking systemês accuracy Lastly while evaluating the QoS properties above we assume the environment   the network the devices and operating system is a fully trusted service This means that we exclude the environment in our compositional trust model but does not mean we cannot include the environment if necessary For example if the environmentês network has a lot of jitter   the speciìed response time of the network is not trustworthy then the networkês trust should also be included when evaluating trust of the composed system We selected this case study because not only it contains distributed heterogeneous components but also it has strict QoS requirements in the form of response time and accuracy Figure 1 shows the experimental setup of the indoor tracking system As shown in this gure three camera sensors track an object that is migrated between ten different predeìned positions within the view range of the each camera As the object is tracked we measure the response time and error of each individual service and the composed system   the indoor tracking system At each position we measure 50 samples of response time and error of the tracked position We then calculate the uncertainty of each measured QoS property using the ratio of number of failures to provide the objectês location   not recognizing the object to the number occurrences the service individually or included in a composition is invoked throughout its execution lifetime Similarly the belief and disbelief values of the QoS properties are calculated using the ratio of the number of occurrences that the reading adheres to a speciìed threshold value for the corresponding property to the number of occurrences the reading does not adhere to the threshold value This calculation is based on past experience and is considered seeding the composition model For example the response time of the sensor2 was below 15ms in 304 readings higher than 15ms in 46 readings and the sensor was unable to recognize the object in 150 readings Using the above concept the trust TABLE II S PECIFICATION OF RESPONSE TIME AND TRUST OF SERVICES of the speciìed response time of the sensor2  15ms is  The speciìcations of QoS properties and trust values based on our past experience with the indoor track system are shown in the Table II and Table III Lastly Figure 2 shows the complete service interaction diagram of the indoor object tracking system As shown in this gure the discovery service selects two of the most appropriate sensors according to accuracy and response time requirements which are referred as non-deterministically select sensor services These services then track the object in parallel referred to as composed sensor service and provide the tracking result to the fusion service Lastly the fusion service outputs the tracked position to the client through the environment service which is negligible in our experiments As mentioned Section III-A response time and error of tracked position are calculated by following a composing

pattern of sensor discovery and fusion services The nondeterministically selected sensor services    are composed of three sensor services     using the exclusive choice pattern When the composition operator and the trust composition operator related to the exclusive choice pattern are applied the following composed property value and the corresponding trust values are obtained for each property    In the equations above we have assumed each camera service will be selected with equal probability    Similarly the property value and the trust value of the second nondeterministically selected sensor service can be calculated Composed sensor service is composed of two nondeterministically selected sensor services   and  using the split/join pattern The properties of the sensor composed service are evaluated as shown in the following equations     Finally the object tracking system is composed of discovery service  the composed sensor service  fusion service  and the environment using the sequence pattern The properties of the object tracking system are evaluated as shown in the following equations     Lastly the summary of the predicted and the actual trust values of the properties is shown in the table IV As shown in this table the predicted trust value of the proposed model is not mathematically equal to the actual trust value obtained from executing the composed system empirically It shows comparatively very high uncertainty associated with the predicted trust value This is because the calculation process of the predicted trust value accumulates the uncertainty factor with the use of more mathematical operations However if the uncertainty is divided between the belief and disbelief with equal weights indicated as normalized trust values in Table IV then the predicted and actual trust value become comparable The predicted trust value therefore conforms to the actual trust value obtained from empirical evaluations while presenting more uncertainty over the predicted results IV R ELATED W ORKS Hwang et al present composition operators for common QoS attributes and primitive interaction patterns However they are not estimating the trust associated with the composition In contrast this paper provides trust operators associated with each of the composition operators for common QoS and primitive interaction patterns Alagar et al propose a formal approach for trustw orthy composition considering safety security and time factors Their composition model requires the participating components to be fully trustworthy However as it is common to use untrustworthy components in a composition specially when third party libraries are required it is important that the composition model be more exible to include the use of untrustworthy components in the composition In contrast our model proposes composition operators that can be applied on components with different levels of trustworthiness Buford et al propose the idea of composition trust binding   a policy for composition to integrate trusted systems among pervasive devices However such a model

processing. We call these çfile data sourcesé and çtable data sourcesé respectively. Our data sources pane has functionalities to create either table or file data sources by uploading a chosen CSV file, as shown in Figure 11   Figure 12. View Creation Fu nctionality \(left\ in operation \(right  3  Data Source Attachment Each data attach-point has a specific minimum schema  expectation to be able to make use of the data source attached. The minimum schema expectation makes some attributes mandatory. For example, a demographic data source is required to have a çCustomerIDé attribute that uniquely identifies each customer.  It may have any number of additional attributes; for example, in the unsupervised segmentation workflow, any additional attribute of a customer is used by the clustering algorithm to measure the similarity between customers. Often, the minimum schema attribute names may not exactly match the customerês attribute names. For example, the customer may use CustIDé to uniquely identify a customer whereas the attach-point may be expecting çCustomerIDé. We have incorporated a view creation facility that helps the customer to create a non-materialized view by mapping the attributes in her data source to those expected by the minimum schema. Once such a view is created, it appears as another data source, and can be chosen from the drop down list of data sources. Figure 12 shows how view creation functionality gives the user the option to pick an attribute from her source to the minimum schema attribute, in this case ID, CUSTID, TRANSACTIONDATE, and TOTALPRICE 4  Downloading Results We implemented the workflow execution as an asynchronous operation, where the user finishes the setup uploading data, attaching data sources, choosing the workflow to be executed\d clicks on çsubmité.

Cloud computing provides shared resources, software and information to computing devices as a utility over the network. It has become widely popular over the last few years and has been assessed to be no less influential than any of the previous trendsetting technologies [13   T h o ugh m a n y o b s ta c l e s to the u s a g e o f  cloud computing have been identified in e s a me report emphasizes that the utility of cloud computing is likely to outweigh its disadvantages. Cloud computing provides many advantages such as elasticity and transference of over-provisioning and under-provisioning risks. Forecas u g g e s t th at clou d co m p u t i n g  w oul d  grow at a very fast rate over the next few years.  Cloud computing has been used for a variety of tasks such as parallel data mining d g raph an al y tic s 16   Analytics Services Though popular analytics engines such as SAS, SPSS and R started off as stand-alone applications that need to be installed on a server to be used, recent trends suggest that commercial analytics engines are not far off from delivering full-fledged analytics capabilities on the cloud. Predixion Software 13 and Zementis 14 offer scoring of any PMML 15 model over the cloud, whereas SAS has started to offer many of their functionalities over the cloud  How ev er, to th e bes t of ou r k n o w l edg e, th ere h a s been  a very limited work on providing powerful analytics functionalities over the cloud that can readily be used without requiring considerable expertise in analytics and the specific tool to be used  Workflows for Analytics The main novelty of the solution proposed in this paper rests in the usage of configurable and extensible multi-workflows to make it easy to use analytics despite limited technical know-how. Analytics workflows themselves are not novel and are the primary means of using SPSS \(with the SPSS Modeler component\wever, a typical SPSS workflow is designed to be used by personnel who understand the semantics of typical data mining operations. In particular, SPSS provides a fleet of functionality that is powerful enough to be used across domains, and is not specific to the scenario in which it may be deployed. For example, the semantics of the CustID field is unknown to a generic clustering operator, and under a default setting, the clustering operator would use the CustID field also for clustering leading to the undesirable results of    13  http://www.predixionsoftware.com/predixion  14  http://www.zementis.com  15  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language

grouping customers with numerically close CustIDs together. We eliminate the need to explicitly specify the exclusion of such attributes, by folding in the semantics of attributes such as CustID \(among others\to the prepackaged workflows. In a pre-packaged workflow for customer segmentation, the fact that CustID needs to be excluded in clustering would already be already preconfigured. The customer can thereby focus on configuring other parameters that are likely to affect business such as number of clusters in the outp ut or the rules to use in designating customers as high-value or low-value. The concept of multi-flows, where a single template workflow can instantiate many possible workflows, has not been developed in prior literature to the best of our knowledge VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Analytics, despite its apparent utility in improving business has not been adopted widely. The main deterrents include the large upfront cost of procuring computing infrastructure and the cost of setting up an in-house analytics team of statisticians and business analysts. Such costs are so high that many small and medium businesses cannot afford traditional analytics solutions, especially in the developing regions of the world due to a spectrum of other deterrent factors that we have outlined. Many such deterrents may be effectively eliminated by the delivery of analytics services on the cloud. In this paper, we propose configurable pre-packaged multi-flows flows that span multiple workflows\ to deliver analytics services on the cloud towards helping to improve analytics penetration Multi-flows bundle together related workflows enabling users to explore and exploit related functionality by making minor configuration changes. We illustrate how changes to workflow configurations may be made easily without any in-depth knowledge of the various operators involved. Our multi-flows are easily extensible to non-disruptively include new functionalities in response to the changing needs of a customer \(or a changing customer base We described a survey of Indian retail players that helped us identify \(and validate our assumptions of\e primary obstacles to analytics penetration in the sector; we also analyzed the major analytics needs of such businesses. We illustrated that many such common analytics needs may be effectively captured within a small number of workflows We developed a fully-functional system that implements the chosen multi-flows for the retail sector. We detailed the various features of the system, the multi-ness of the flows in the system, and example configuration settings that can be used to fine tune specific multi-flows. Through generous usage of screenshots, we illustrated the ease of use of our system; we expect that such enhanced convenience of usage will aid penetration of analytics into new customer bases  Future Work We are exploring further enhancements to improve ease of use of analytics solutions on the cloud including an automatic mapping of attributes in data sources to attach-points by exploiting the data type and distribution Also, making analytics widespread would necessarily involve addressing some of the problems that are applicable to cloud computing in general. These include concerns about data privacy in the cloud and the loss of control of the computation elopin g techn iqu es  to eff ecti v el y an d  provably anonymize of data without affecting the results of specific operators such as clustering or classification is an interesting direction to pursue A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Abhishek Subramanian, Neethu Suresh Shubhendu Aggarwal and Varun Srivastava for efforts in implementing the system and performing market surveys VII  R EFERENCES  1  Todd Morrison, çRetail chain uses in-house analytics team to run SAP BusinessObjectsé, TechTarget Search SAP, 4 th March, 2011 http://searchsap.techtarget.com/news/2240033086/Retail-chain-uses-in-houseanalytics-team-to-run-SAP-BusinessObjects  2  Rakesh Agrawal, and Ramakrishnan Srikant, çFast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databasesé,  VLDB 1994, Chile 3  How to structure a business analytics team http://mybusinessanalytics.blogspot.in/2011/09/business-analytics-teamstructure.html Retrived March 2, 2012 4  MA Rappa, çThe utility business model and the future of computing services IBM Systems Journal, 43\(1\ 2004 5  Brian Hayes, çCloud Computingé, Comm.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
