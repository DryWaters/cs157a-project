s0 96 041 7@m a il.n c yu edu t w  2 andrew@mail.ncyu.edu.tw Abstract In this paper, a movement training system aiming to classify motions for physical education is proposed and analyzed. Traditional physical education requires an instructor teaching exercise movement individually. Teaching every student in a big class demands considerable time and efforts. Utilization of computer assisted instruction \(CAI becomes pervasive in e-learning trend. However, CAI is often confined in literal form course such as mathematics, language 
courses. It is necessary to deve lop a motion training system for physical education. In this paper, we develop a low-cost motion capture with Wii Remote Control \(Wiimote\r training movement exercise, such as tennis and baseball. This system applies Wiimotes to capturing acceleration of each part of limbs. Each Wiimote is attached to the limb, and then send back the acceleration information to the computer via Bluetooth wireless link. After gat hering acceleration data of multiple limbs’ parts, the computer recognizes the motion and classifies the motion to several correct and incorrect categories 
As a result, it is able to provi de the appropriate advice to the students. The system applies a mo dified ID3 inductive learning to generate a decision tree with continuous-valued attributes We develop an easy-to-use GUI interface for coaches. The results show that the average accu racy of classification is 83 The system reduces the workload of the coach and improves teaching and learning performance Keywords Decision tree  ule induction otion training; Wiimote 
1  Introduction Recent advances in motion detection and computation power create the opportunity of using computer vision and motion detection techniques to video game for entertainment, computer-aided coaching for education. An interesting case study is sports motions training. During the basic movement training, a coach is obliged to constantly supervise the students’ movement. It is difficult to the coach teaching in a big class. In that case, the automated feedback 
training system is required  Previous work related to motion training that require lab-like environment [1, 3, 8 m u ltip le o p tical o r m a g n e tic sensor on the field, retro-reflective markers or magnetic sensors to be placed on an athlete body. These requirement and expensive cost restrain the broader use of motion capture system  The sensors on the body are often wired to the computer and thus constrain the movement of the trainer In this project, an easy-to-use motion training 
feedback system is developed and analyzed. Exercise such as tennis and baseball needs much time on training basic motion, for example, swing and pitching. This paper proposes an inertial motion capture system for motion training.  A system overview is shown in figure 1. The system is built of on-the-shelf gadgets. The system is inexpensive and easy to installation. Multiple Wiimotes are attached to limbs to gather a real-time acceleration data. A laptop processes the accelerati 
on data and then classifies the motions to several right or wrong category. Therefore the computer displays a suitable feedback message to the trainer according to the motion type  Figure 1. The training system consists of the Posture Capture Subsystem and Motion Classification Subsystem  The motion classification is the crucial component of 


Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Ma chine Learning and Cybernetics, Baoding, 12-15 July 2009 3006 this system. Wiimotes contain inexpensive accelerometers sensors. However, the accelera tion data are not enough to reconstruct the precise motion and posture. The proposed system use modified ID3 decision tree induction learning for continuous-value accelera tion attributes. The training data are generated by a coach. One correct motion type and several incorrect motion types are labeled in our experiment Each motion type is corresponding to one feedback. The students are able to correct their motion by advices. The proposed system is also a user-friendly physical education system. A graphic user interface \(GUI\implemented in this system. The coach and the athletes are able to get familiar with this system in a few minutes The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, this paper survey two related topics which are decision tree and motion capture technique. In Section III we propose a motion training sy stem for physical education and then discuss the acceleration data gathering and decision tree induction. In Section IV, the experiments are carried out. Tennis forehand swings are our example training dataset. The results show that the average accuracy is above 80%. In Section V, we conclude the paper and offer some future works and promising research points 2  Related work The proposed system co mbine decision tree and motion capture technique  This section introduces related research of these two techniques 2.1  Decision Tree Classification is an application of data mining. The design of a classifier can be categorize into tree concept based on similarity, clustering and probability. Choosing the right model is an important issue in this research Decision tree induction creates a comprehended classification model. It simp lifies the complicated decision to an explicit decision tree. It provides an explanation to many complex problems. As a result, it is applied to many AI applications such as image recognition, text abstract and expert system A decision tree is a tree-lik e model which is able to determine the class of give n instance. Each node is a division point which partitions the space of sample by an attribute test. And then each partitioned subtree is partitioned to subspaces with child node recursively. This is a divide-and-conquer paradigm for classification. Finally every attribute will be tested and then each sample subspace can be classified into a class which is a leaf node Decision tree is an effective model for nominal attribute. However, the decision tree will be too complicated when attribute is continuous value. It causes the low precision and multiple subtrees. Combining adjacent value into one cluster is a solution for this problem For conquer this problem. Distance function will be applied in  It co ul d ha n d l e c o nt i n uo us  val u e at t r i but e Deci di n g  suitable bin will generate the more precision decision tree 2.2  Motion Capture To do the motion training, several motion-tracking methods with different motion capture system are developed. This part introduce a variety of motion capture on motion training application Optical motion capture system s track optical marker to  x act 3D marker locations are computed from the images r ecorded by the surrounding cameras using triangulation methods.  These systems are favored in the computer-animation community and the film industry because of thei r exceptional accuracy and extremely fast update rates. The major disadvantages of this approach are extreme cost and lack of portability. Specific area and equipment are needed. To reduce cost and improve portability, some systems use a small number of markers in conjunction with standard video cameras. Beside optical maker method, another emerging technology is markless motion capture [2  It  use c o m put er vi si o n o b t a i n m o t i on parameters directly from video footage without using special markers. These appro aches are less accurate than optical systems, however, they are more affordable and more portable.  Still, they are not entirely self-contained since they rely on one or more external cameras Furthermore, they suffer from line-of-sight problems especially in the case of monocular video Magnetic systems detect position and orientation by the relative magnetic flux created by coils or earth. Metallic objects interfere with magnetic  these systems may detect metallic marker. The advantage of these systems is good accuracy and medium update rates They also eliminate lineof-sight problems. The disadvantages are expensive cost, high power consumption nonlinear measurement accuracy and are sensitive to the presence of metallic objects in the environment Mechanical systems require performers to wear exoskeletons. These systems measure joint angles directly rather than estimating the positions of points on the body and can record motions almost anywhere. Exoskeletons are uncomfortable to wear for extended time periods and impede motion, although these problems are alleviated in some of the modern systems, such as Measurand’s ShapeWrapTM 


Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Ma chine Learning and Cybernetics, Baoding, 12-15 July 2009 3007 Radio Frequency \(RF\ and acoustic systems both are remote sensing techniques. They use the time-of-flight of an audio or RF signal to co mpute the marker locations Most current systems are not portable and handle only a small number of markers   Inertial   motion   capture   systems measure rotation of the joint angles using gyroscopes or accelerometers placed on each body limb [4, 5 the  mechanical systems, they ar e portable, but cannot measure positions and distances directly for applications that must sample the geometry of objects in the environment  More importantly, the measurements drift by significant amounts over extended time periods  In addition, the motion of the root cannot be reliably recovered from inertial sensors alone, although in some cases this problem can be alleviated by detecting foot plants Nowadays, motion and rotation capture technology propagate into the education a nd recreation. Wii Console is a very popular game console. It creates the possibility by using low-cost approach to capture the motion of user Wiimote is the master component of the Wii console. It usually captures the human motion. Like the  Motion Capture technology improve the motion training systems. Motion capture system is able to support gymnast’s training [2 A user can directly interact with the virtual gymnast. The user’s arm motions are blended to the original aerial motions in order to verify their consequences on the virtual gymnast’s performance 3  System Architecture The proposed motion training system consists of two subsystems, a motion capture subsystem and a decision tree induction subsystem. A motion capture subsystem is able to acquire acceleration data of each body part by Wiimote These data are encoded, and jo intly transmitted to a laptop The main program is installed in laptop which samples the signals from all the Wiimote and transfers them onto the storage drive for off-line data processing and ID3 inductive learning. This section describes our hardware and its operation. The motion capture subsystem captures the motion and induction tree subsystem using ID3 inductive learning to generate a decision tree model for motion classification. It classifies user motion according to limbs acceleration of X, Y and Z axes. This process is real-time when training. The trainer can review the advice when training  Figure 2. The flow chart of the proposed system  Fig. 2 depicts the flow chart of this system. It shows the data processing procedure In motion capture subsystem the acceleration of each limb is acquired by Wiimote. Then the acceleration data are transmitted to a laptop via WiimoteLib e lap t o p sto r es t h ese d a ta to its d a tab a se In decision tree induction subsystem, the data are retrieved from data warehouse, and then use the ID3 inductive learning algorithm to build a decision tree. The building process will be mentioned later in this paper 3.1  Motion Capture Subsystem   Figure 3. The architecture of motion capture subsystem  The purpose of motion capture subsystem is to capture the acceleration data of the user This subsystem still needs to satisfy additional requirement which decrease cost and facilitate setup. Thus, this system adopts on-the-shelf 


Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Ma chine Learning and Cybernetics, Baoding, 12-15 July 2009 3008 gadgets such as Wiimote and conventional laptop. The software architecture is illustrated as Fig. 3 The Wiimote is a wireless device which uses the Bluetooth standard which allows two-way communication to other Bluetooth devices including PCs [1  Up t o  4  controllers can be used with same Wii console at the same time. The Wiimote has 9 buttons which provides control availability. The extraordinary feature of Wiimote is the motion-sensing capability. The controller has one three axes ADXL330 accelerometer which can be used to determine acceleration of x, y and z displacements vector. The measurement range of the acceler ometer is typically +/- 5G The controller has a speaker and provides limited rumble feedback The accelerometers of Wiimotes are able to capture the acceleration data while limbs ar e exerting. The Wiimote are fastened on each limb when users training. The acceleration data will be translated to x y, z displacement vector. And then the data will be transferred to laptop. The motion capture program handles these processes. In Figure 3, The WiimoteLib objects are responsible for initiating and manage Bluetooth communication link to Wiimote. The Wiimote collection object creates and mange WiimoteLib  The WiimoteInfo object is a graphical user interface which displays the detail information of each Wiimote. The Multiple Wiimote Form is an object which allow user to control the training process In the process of capturing motion dataset, the user press button A to start capture motion. After the presetting duration, the recorded accelera tion data of the motion will store into the data warehouse. These motion dataset should be used by ID3 inductive learning as next section 3.2  Decision Tree Model The decision tree subsys tem use ID3 inductive learning. The algorithm of ID3 inductive learning describe as following  ID3 \(Examples, Target_Attribute, Attributes Create a root node for the tree If all examples are positive, Return the single-node tree Root, with label If all examples are negative Return the single-node tree Root, with label If number of predicting attributes is empty, then Return the single node tree Root, with label = most common value of the target attribute in the examples Otherwise Begin A = The Attribute that best classifies examples Decision Tree attribute for Root = A For each possible value, vi, of A Add a new tree branch below Root, corresponding to the test A = vi Let Examples\(vi\ the subset of examples that have the value vi for A If Examples\(vi\ is empty Then below this new branch add a leaf node with label most common target value in the examples Else below this new branch add the subtree ID3 Examples\(vi\ Target_Attribute, Attributes – {A End Return Root Information gain is calculated from the entropy of the subtree and collection of the object  1 The largest information gain attribute will be selected as test attribute in this node 4  Experiment To assess the performance of the proposed motion training system, an evaluation of the tentative tennis motion training system has been carried out. The experiment chooses forehand swing motion as the training sample data set. There are four categories as the output of the decision tree induction. Table 1 presents the detail of the four categories. Each motion returns a unique feedback. The system has been collection 230 sample dataset. With a coach labeling, the classifier ar e able to classify the motion with ID3 algorithms. The system is written in a C language by using WiimoteLib  Table 1. Categories of motion dataset Categories Feedback The number of samples Correct forehand swing Excellent 80 Only swing wrist Swing the whole arm 50 Arm unstretch Stretch out the arm 50 Racquet is not vertical Grip the racquet horizontally 50  Figure 4 is the gadget which user required in the experiment. Two Wiimotes are fastened on a user’s upper arm and lower arm. One Wiimote is gripped in user’s hand The user swings forehand after pressing button A. The acceleration will be recorded and then send back to the laptop immediately

The position of the Wiimote  Figure 5 is the acceleration data measured in three motion type. We measure the acceleration in G. The duration of measurement is one second. Each motion sample contains 600 attributes. There are three lines in each graph. The blue line is acceleration on X axis. The red line is acceleration on Y axis. The green line is acceleration on Z axis. Figure 5\(a\ is the graphs of correct forehand swings The accelerometers in three pos ition all measure significant acceleration. Figure 5\(b\he motions which only swing wrist. The beginners often do this wrong swing. The figure shows that accelerometer on upper arm measures low acceleration value. Figure 5\(c is the motion at which the user swings without stretching arm. This also another mistake the beginners often do. This figure is similar to figure 5\(b\. However, the acceleration of X on upper arm is larger than previous motion. This feature can be used in the classifier In the final experiment we check the accuracy of classifier. In this experiment, 50% samples are used to training the decision tree. 50% sample are used to be classified by the decision tree As table 2, the correct swing motion is most accuracy. It may caused by the large number of training sample. The accuracy of motion at which the user’s racquet is not vertical is lowest

In our experiment, the computer assisted motion training suits with tennis sw ing training. Since learning these skills requires drills and pr actices, this system aids the students with motion recording and advice. On the other hand, the efficiency of motion cl assifiers is our concern. In this research, the classifier applies a multi-interval decision rule on continuous value to reduce the size of the decisions tree This research conducts a set of experiments to quantify the benefits of combining classification and body sensor data for motion training. We believe that our motion training system provides significant improvement over conventional motion training. In our motion training system accelerometer data is used as a feedback to the user allowing him to coarsely adjust his motion to. In addition our system evaluates the moti on in real-time and provide the appropriate advice  In the further research, other training scenario will be investigated. Martial art or other acute body movement will measured high acceleration. Th ese scenarios will need a more sophisticate accelerometer. We expect design a specific suit for intense movement.

generalization and the adaptation phase is realized by specialization. The above mentioned elements of component-oriented process modeling are related to each other in Figure 1 [26   Figure 1: Conceptual model of elements for process modeling and their relations  An example instantiation of this conceptual model representing a part of a process model is shown in Figure 2   Figure 2: Example instantiation of the conceptual model  The methodology derived in this section focuses on the identification of activities and targets their standardization to RPBBs. According to common process definitions [23] and the concepts of Method Engineering [27], the methodology consists of design activities and respective design results \(cp.

The first sub-activity aims at identifying any contained activity, task, function or similar within the underlying model basis.

The subsequent section discusses the evaluation of the designed methodology 


the evaluation of the designed methodology according to the design research paradigm  4. Evaluation of RPBBs  The evaluation described in this paper focuses on RPBBs which are the results of applying the methodology \(not the designed artifact itself Findings about quality and applicability of RPBBs allow conclusions regarding the quality and applicability of the underlying methodology. In this contribution, a formal and a contentual evaluation are differentiated. While the formal part contains theoretical analyses of RPBBs regarding predefined requirements \(cp. Section 3.1 documents the practical \(content-related applicability of RPBBs  4.1. Formal Evaluation  As part of the research project, twelve workshops and several interviews in European municipalities have been conducted which involved domain experts and modeling specialists who had to benchmark each RPBB with regards to fulfillment of the defined design goals \(cp. section 3.1 completely fulfilled, +/- partially fulfilled, - not fulfilled  not evaluated yet municipalities provided process models that were used to identify process activities and to design the RPBB. However they were not involved in the design process thus ensuring validity of the evaluation results through separation of data used to develop the method from evaluation data. As already mentioned in Section 3.1, the requirement of a minimal number Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 of RPBBs is replaced by relevancy/necessity. If all RPBBs are considered relevant and necessary, the number of RPBBs can be assumed minimal. Three RPBBs have not been evaluated, as they have just been identified during the prior evaluation period Table 6 provides an overview of the results  Table 6: Evaluation of RPBBs Requirements No. of evaluated RPBBs    Modularity 24 10 0 3 Reusability 33 1 0 3 Comprehensibility 31 3 0 3 Unambiguity 20 14 0 3 Documentation 33 1 0 3 Relevancy/Necessity 27 7 0 3 Multilingualism 34 0 0 3 Level of Generality 33 1 0 3 Level of Detail 22 12 0 3  Altogether, the degree of accomplishment can be considered as high. There is no RPBB that does not meet the demands. However, deficiencies can be identified regarding modularity, unambiguity and level of detail. Examples for deficits concerning the level of detail are the RPBBs ?send? and ?archive Especially archiving can be understood as a modular activity or separate process fragment. Weaknesses regarding modularity and unambiguity are closely related to the demand that only minimal overlapping should occur. Although overlapping could not be prevented completely, the evaluators? feedback initiated extensive revisions on names, synonyms examples and explanations of RPBBs. A list of the most deficient RPBBs is presented in Table 7. These 


most deficient RPBBs is presented in Table 7. These RPBBs have to be carefully analyzed during further modeling activities in order to be improved or rejected  Table 7: List of most deficient RPBBs RPBB No. of Deficiencies Coordinate 10 Assign 3 Take from 3 Change/Update/Complete 3  Summarizing, suitability of RPBBs for distributed modeling of collaborative processes can be confirmed on the basis of the formal evaluation However, evaluation from a content-based perspective provides more experience-driven and thus, practice-related feedback 4.2. Contentual Evaluation  For contentual, practice-oriented evaluation, a number of 200 processes have been modeled with five municipalities that are involved in the project to prove practical applicability. Using a prototypical web-based tool implementation, the modeling was carried out in a distributed manner by public administration officials. The procedure for distributed collaborative modeling required each official to depict the present status of their process fragments as well as the information flow with other process participants \(whom themselves modeled their activities points out the basic principle of differentiating RPBBs and information objects is presented in Figure 3 using the Business Process Modeling Notation [30 This fragment depicts the involvement of another collaborating unit within a municipal approval process which the building authority is basically responsible for. This unit participates in the service production by providing a statement. Although specific attributes have been annotated for RPBBs and information objects, they are not visible in the presented view. Examples are the number of pages and medium of information objects as well as communication channel, number of copies, and template support \(cp. Table 5 Documenting 200 real processes of diverse public administrations proved to be very valuable because both, the various issues as well as the perceived advantages of the component-based modeling approach emerged. Most important advantages mentioned by evaluators from public administrations are the standardization and flexibility of process modeling \(consistent levels of detail and generality as well as terminological pre-definitions specifications that enable modeling also for inexperienced people, and the transparent modeling approach \(combination of RPBBs and information objects methodology meets the basic requirements for distributed modeling of collaborative processes discussed in Section 2.1 Perceived issues to be addressed are a lack of awareness about some self-evident activities uncertainties regarding overlapping \(which should have been eliminated to a large extent level of detail which causes relatively high modeling efforts. Issues and advantages have to be considered by further research as the discussed findings only represent perception in the public sector domain  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009

Summary and Outlook  This paper describes the development of a methodology for the domain-independent identification of Reference Process Building Blocks which can be used for distributed modeling in collaborative process environments. Based on an initial evaluation of adaptation mechanisms from the area of reference modeling, suitability of a compositional \(building block-based derived. This contribution describes both the construction as well as the evaluation of the methodology in the public sector where the identified RPBBs have been used exemplarily for modeling of about 200 municipal processes Summarizing, the RPBB-based modeling is considered to be suitable to model collaborative processes in a distributed way. A number of advantages can be exploited from the described component based modeling approach such as the reduction of model heterogeneity and the diffusion of a common understanding \(through standardization of terminology, level of detail and level of abstraction the distributed modeling of process fragments by responsible domain experts as well as the consistent consolidation of the process fragments to complete process models based on their standardized components The actual methodology for RPBB identification provides a valuable basis for targeted users \(cp Section 1 individual domains and purposes. Although this contribution is limited to an analysis of the suitability for the public sector domain, the specified RPBBs can be evaluated for the use in other industries that focus on information management and collaborative service production \(e.g. finance or insurance sectors as well However, the claimed generality of the actual methodology for domain-independent identification of RPBBs has not been proven yet. For that purpose current research is concentrating on applying the methodology to other industries. Due to the collaborative character of medical treatment processes and the highly specialized and distributed knowledge of involved actors, the health care domain was selected for a follow-up project. The expected findings will provide valuable information to improve the methodology described in this paper Further challenges and potential fields for research arose during the evaluation. First, guidance rules should be developed in order to implement capable plausibility and consistency checks not only from a syntactic but especially from a semantic point of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 view [31]. Additional evaluation of the methodology itself \(which is the actual artifact by using the methodology in other domains, in order to refine and complete the design activities. A potential disadvantage identified during evaluation is related to the high level of detail which has to be managed. Although the provided methodology is 


managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements.
