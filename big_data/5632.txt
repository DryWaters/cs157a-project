Meeting Real-time Requi rements for a low bitrate Multimedia encoding framework   Amit Pande, Ankush Mittal, Amit Verma and Praveen Kumar   A BSTRACT  A serious bottleneck in real-time multimedia applications is the non-availability of required network bandwidth. While much research has been done on multimedia compression and network resource optimization multimedia delivery is still a big concern especially for scarce resource networks. The virtues of network aware video coding and application of domain specific compression techniques have not yet been fully explored. In 
this paper we propose a dynamic Network Bandwidth Allocation Scheme which deals with intelligent transmission of the video sequence over the network. We incorporate the knowledge of the network conditions to determine how various parts of the video frames are encoded. The module is called is called SDM \(Smart Decision Maker\ and it builds over an intelligent classification of Video into Visual Objects \(VOs\ An estimate of the available network bandwidth is obtained which is then distributed optimally between the different frame constituents based on their relative importance and motion  1  INTRODUCTION 
 Meeting bandwidth requirements and maintaining acceptable image quality simultaneously is a challenge for image and multimedia processing community. This paper addresses the following issues to develop a network-based resource allocation framework for low motion videos:  \(a The solution must enable a streaming server to perform real-time  processing \(b\ It should generate an optimal bitstream that is best perceptually based on the estimates from the network \(c\ It must enable low-complexity decoding with low-memory requirement s \(d\The scalable bitstream 
must be resilient to packet loss events In this paper we discuss a new approach for network aware optimal    resource    allocation referred   as    SDM. The multimedia is first generically classified into various Visual   Figure 1.

is the classification of sample video frames into various VOs. However, this depends on the type and requirements of the videos. For example Figure 1 shows the snapshots of a    classroom   video    which      are     different   from   the requirements of a remote laboratory video sequence shown in figure 2 or a video surveillance sequence shown in figure 3 In figure 1 we are interested in the important objects of the video. For example Ö a classroom video can be modeled as composition of the teacher, black board and the background. The background here is static and we have prior information regarding the characteristics of the frame and 
VOs associated. We can specific parameters to segment out the teacher and black board regions as shown in [2  Th e  remote laboratory videos pose a different challenge where there is large activity within a localized region. A local time adaptive mean of Gaussian scheme is used to segment the important regions from remote laboratory sequence [3   The scalability and efficient implementation required in Amit Pande is currently a graduate student at Iowa State University, Ames, USA.

Video Surveillance applications poses real-time high computation constraints. The time adaptive mean of Gaussian scheme is used for such videos also however, in these cases we are more vigilant about activity. In remote laboratory videos only significant regions were considered VOs while in Surveillance videos we have to consider insignificant motion regions also as possible surveillance objects 2.1  Classroom object Segmentation A typical classroom lecture has Teacher Writing On board TWOB\ sessions \(Fig. 1\. These sessions have a teacher complete view\writing on Black Board and explaining the class points to the students. Some special characteristics that help in identifying TWOB frames are as follows: The complete board is visible, motion is slow, some students may be visible in the view and a significant part of the tutor's body may be visible in the frame \(see Fig.1\. The height of teacher in these frames generally doesnêt vary much. Frame are classified into three visual objects: background, Black Board and the tutor. In this paper, we have modeled the background for static camera. Modeling the background  is  an  important  task.  For  static  camera, we  Figure 3.

Segmentation of Visual Objects. \(a\ The background frame. \(b Moving regions that are segmented from the current frame. \(c\ Identified visual objects   need to reconstruct the region corresponding to the tutor For the initial prediction of the background, we assume a set of frames that have significant tutor motion. Next we extract the background region by removing the teacher region. We find the pixel difference matrix of the two frames and enhance it to get two largest Visual Objects. Then they are removed to obtain the background image. Then we detect the horizontal and vertical regions and find the black board regions. Finally, we find the teacher region by comparing the present frame with the modeled background Figure 4 shows the working of our approach on an instructional video 2.2  Statistical Model based Video Segmentation By adopting the video in terms of the relevance of the objects detected in each frame we avoid the improper bandwidth usage in preserving the quality of useless parts of the video. Therefore our first module uses a real time segmentation approach to detect moving objects in the scene. In surveillance video scenes, most of the picture typically belongs to the background, where the pixel value is easily estimated with the use of a statistical background model Since real time processing is required for object segmentation, the time adaptive mixture of Gaussians method, proposed by Satuffer n d H a r v i l l e 5] i s us e d  w h i c h i s a  robust and also computationally inexpensive. In the general method, the temporal signal is modeled with a timeadaptive mixture of Gaussians with R components. The probability of observing the value z\(t\ at time t is given by      1     R ttttt rrr r Pz w Nz      where  t r w   t r  and  t r  are the mixing coefficients, the mean, and the standard deviation, respectively, of the r-th Gaussian of the mixture associated with the signal at time t  The details of the implementation are given in [4,5  F i g u r e  5 shows a sample input and output of our segmentation algorithm over a video frame 3  COMPRESSION  SCHEME DWT based compression algorithms have been developed in the recent years to address multi-resolution delivery of video streams. The Embedded Zerotree Wavelet \(EZW 11,16 a l g o r i t hm  ge n e r a t e s e n c o de d b i t s i n a s p e c i f i c o r de r of importance. Both EZW and SPIHT [17 a r e s p a t i a l tr ee based and  exploit magnitude correlation across  barids  of decomposition. We use a modified CEZW algorithm [13  to develop a real-time video compression system The design considerations for a scalable coder are the proper choice of a transform filter that serves as bottom support for efficient Wavelet domain coding techniques. Le  Gallês 5/3 filter was used in the implementation to achieve a simple design of this module with less floating point operations. This helps to achieve a real-time implementation 259 


The input image \( RGB color\ was transformed to YUV space and 4:2:0 down-sampled by the encoder 4  SMART  DECISION  MAKER The desired objective of video coding for any multimedia application is to achieve the continuous curve that parallels the distortion-rate curve with a single bit stream. A network aware content based scheme can achieve this goal. We utilize the virtues of Dynamic Resource Allocation that adaptively manages the bandwidth allocation to the different VOs according to their relative importance and their perceptible quality. Thus the network traffic is decided based on a\ Available Network Bandwidth b\ Relative Motion in the VB c\ User Preference DRA closely tracks the unpredictable bandwidth variations due to heterogeneous access-technologies of the receivers e.g., analog modem, cable mode, xDSL, etc.\r due to dynamic changes in network conditions \(e.g., congestion events\. The estimate of Network Bandwidth is based on round trip time \(RTT\ calculations from Network Bandwidth Estimation tools. We illustrate our generic SDM algorithm next The input frames, after classification into VOs are separately coded by a CEZW coder into different bit streams The compressor gives the Energy of each VO as an output along with the compressed stream. The VOs are arranged in a Group \(called as GOP or Group of Pictures We identify each VO in the stream in current GOP. The index i has been used for GOP number m for frame number k for th k visual block found in the stream. Let K VBs be present in the present GOP and k=0 corresponds to background. Let G denotes the group of picture size. We have considered a static size of VB for one GOP and the information is sent at the beginning of each GOP k i  denotes the relative area of th k VB in th i frame It should be noted that 1 1[1 K k i k i GOP     This ensures that the areas are normalized. The motion in each block is measured as k i   11  max   kk iii kkk iGOP i i ar VO ar F abs       where k i VO denotes the area of selected VO k  thus denotes the maximum change in size of VO during one GOP The degree of motion of k th VO is used to allocating a higher bandwidth to it.   We define the proportionality factor i   as follows        ibl i kkkk ii allk BB kEP           Figure 6.

For example- in case of instructional classroom lectures we can pre-set high priority to blackboard i k E denotes the energy of the error frame \(or the mean square value of error frame\ for VO and hence the degree ofmotion in the VO. Finally, the bandwidth is allocated using the following rule     kkkkk ii i ii B WkEP     where k varies over all available VOs for a GOP  and 0 1 1 K ii k k BB     5  SYSTEM  SUMMARY The overall scheme presented in this work is presented in figure 6. The input videos were first classified in terms of their content. As explained both static and moving background scenes were modeled using background modeling and L-TAMOG technique. The Network Bandwidth Allocation scheme explained in the previous section is used to transmit different VOs according to their significance. The degree of motion in the VO, and their relative significance determine the allotted available bandwidth 6  EXPERIMENTS  AND  RESULTS   The experiments are presented in this section. The verification of the proposed algorithm was done primarily using MATLAB. The segmentation scheme, the compression block \(CEZW coder\ and simulation of SDM module was done in MATLAB and later the code was implemented on a Visual C++ platform. The network bandwidth estimates were taken using simulations on Network Simulator \(NS2 Figure 7,8 show the reconstructed frames for different videos. In figure 7 and 8 we can observe that a slightly higher bandwidth is required. For figure 8, we can observe that the poor quality of input video leads to poor perception of the reconstructed frames. This figure illustrates how we can distribute bandwidth based on available network resources 260

In case of instructional classroom lectures we have given high higher weights to black board region to ensure better perceptual reconstruction. Is can be observed that the drop of bandwidth \(frames 100-200\o a small value causes the transmission to almost limit itself to blackboard region  7  CONCLUSIONS  AND  FUTURE  WORK The advantages of content based video classification are used to develop a network aware coding scheme in this paper. We present the use of dynamic Network resource allocation scheme built over a wavelet based scalable encoder for a wide variety of videos and explains the working of bandwidth distribution scheme  Figure 12 : Bandwidth distribution amongst various VOs for instructional videos A future work in this direction can be the practical development and of such a system and incorporation of a robust bandwidth estimation module to the system. The proposed system can be developed and integrated in a reconfigurable platform to utilize the virtues of reconfigurable computing to achieve a cheap yet robust and fast implementation.

Leading ERP software vendors such as SAP and Oracle routinely claim that the processes that are embedded in the software are typically of best practice. The software vendors also claim that the continuous updates of the software released as versions incorporate improvements in the processes technology and other management issues. These large ERP software vendors reportedly investigated business processes across a wide variety of organizations and industries and then modeled the best of them into their software solutions [57, 58, 59  In fact, the term best practices is used as a marketing term and incorporated into various ERP products by large software vendors For example, SAP best practices ERP is a product trade mark and Oracle claims that the best practice processes are part of Oracle s application integration architecture and their software solutions. This view is questioned by the recent research which argues that the organizational politics and other factors influence the creation of best practice software and the practices embedded in the software are in fact compromises rather than best practices any  case, software vendors best practices mostly relate to standard processes such as procure to pay  order to cash and hire to retire and do not cater to some non-standard and unique processes such as product development which are now considered vital for gaining competitive edge The software vendors argue that the ERP software can be pre-configured to deal with a pre-determined flexible process and transactional options through the use of complex tables, parameters and switches. Once these options are decided by the company using the solution manager or some other tool provided by the software vendor, it is extremely difficult and expensive to change these options in future. While tools such as solution managers may help in reducing the long implementation times and training costs, and thereby the total cost of ownership, the system remains inflexible after implementation Changing the processes after the implementation is beyond the scope of many enterprises, while the current environment requires their processes to be dynamic and change continually in response to those needs. Thus, there is an inherent conflict between the flexibility of the business operations and the rigidity imposed by the ERP system Even though some of the latest developments such as web services and service oriented architecture are expected to offer process components/building blocks and allow easy and flexible configuration, it is still in nascent stage of implementation Implementing these best practice processes and discarding the existing processes is expected to contribute to improved performan th es e  best practice processes embedded in the software any variability in the process that is required for business reasons, may have to be handled as an exception expending considerable resources. Thus while best practices offer some benefits in terms of efficiencies, they may not really contribute to agility While periodic software upgrades may ensure continuous improvement of processes, the embedded best practices may have no influence on the ability of the firm to build agile processes Embracing the best practice view advocated by the ERP vendors, may reduce the autonomy eliminate competitive local practices and mandate higher order decisions. This may actually stifle creativity and process innovation and may limit the potential of organizational business processes to be agile and dynamic  3.6. Process orientation  Central to the notion of process, the term process orientation or transversality is defined as a set of activities that transform inputs into outputs for customers d re f e rs t o th e proces sorien ted  view of an ERP system. This definition emphasizes value adding activities, customer orientation and repetitiveness. Understanding their activities from a horizontal perspective would allow firms to get closer to their customers while simultaneously increasing the quality of their organization and their competitiveness  Use of common language, customer focus cooperation, holistic or big picture view, reduction of costs and delays, increasing learning, standardization and coordination are some of the manifestations of process-orientation a n E R P env i ronm ent  i t  becomes necessary for everyone in the organization to understand not only the process in which they work, but also their own specific task, along with the impact their work have on other aspects of business Implementation of enterprise systems do not guarantee the cross functionality of the organization It has to be built throughout the project s life cycle  T h e ex te n t o f t h e proces sorien tat i on accomplished may be restricted and dependent upon the implementation strategies d th e e x te n t o f  organizational integration and standardization achieved through ES implementation.

contribute to a firm s ability to build agile processes is uncertain  4. Research Methodology  4.1. Research objectives & methods  The objective of this research study is to analyse the influence of enterprise systems implementation on business process agility in an organizational context. Studying enterprise system as a system of processes may potentially reveal unanticipated synergies that can be created by exploiting interrelationships among its elements that exist in the new system, but did not exist in the old Characteristics of enterprise systems that include integration, standardization, best practices and process orientation are used as a framework in this study Using these characteristics as framework, this exploratory study focuses on the influence of each of the key characteristics on the ability of the firm to build agility in their processes. With this in mind, the research was undertaken in order to develop understandings of the impact by a case study method As Gummesson points out, the aim of case studies is not to establish a superficial cause-effect relationships and/or correlations, but to reach a fundamental understanding of structure and process  a s e s t u d y  m e th odol ogy ca n  f acilita te t h e development of understandings of the multiple interpretations of organisational life and can capture contextual richness and complexity Case study research thus offers deep insight into the impact of information systems on various organizational dimensions and attempts to understand the phenomena. Using semi-structured in-depth interviews of the key respondents that are actively involved in the adoption, implementation of the enterprise systems and post-implementation management of the company operations, primary data is collected. Given the nature of questions, in-depth interviews based on the perceptions, views and experience of the key individuals in the organization are considered more insightful. These interviews are recorded with prior permission and transcribed for further analysis. The data thus collected is coded and analyzed with reference to the characteristics discussed earlier Typical to case study research, this study had limitations including the lack of generalisability and subjective bias j ected by t h e res earch er a s  w e ll  as respondents. The extent of cooperation from different respondents in the organization was not uniform and the respondents may have either overrated or underrated the issues. These limitations however, are unlikely to have affected the validity and reliability of the outcomes significantly because the objective of the study was not to generalize, but to provide anecdotal evidence. The following section gives a brief background to the case study organization studied  4.2 Case study organization  The case study organization is a continuous process manufacturing company that makes chemical products. This is a typical make to stock company that also fulfils some specific orders of major customers. Started about a decade ago, it currently employs about 400 persons. This organisation has SAP for the past ten years starting from the earlier versions and is now running on ECC 5.0. It has Sales and distribution \(SD\, materials management \(MM Financials \(FI/CO\lant Maintenance \(PM\sset management \(AM\ and Production planning \(PP modules. The company had carried about 20 modifications \(customisation\ to the software at the time of initial implementation in 1997. With every new upgrade in the past ten years, however, the company was able to do away with those software customizations gradually and now is close to a vanilla implementation In addition to SAP, Lotus Notes, Novel networks systems, in business environment; it has a specialised manufacturing process control system and a laboratory information system. Interfaces with SAP were built for these applications. As mentioned in the literature review section, the scope of implementation would influence the effect of several ES characteristic such as integration and standardization and therefore their influence on the process agility By implementing most of the application modules the system is qualified as a good candidate for this investigation and therefore is selected for this study This company therefore has the potential to offer a rich organizational context for this research. The following section describes the research framework and presents analysis and findings  5. Analysis & Findings   Integration, standardization, best practices and process orientation are the four key characteristics of enterprise system s enabled environment. The following section evaluates their potential influence on agility and reports on the findings derived from the analysis  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


5.1. Standardization & agility  Standardization and integration of the processes information, business rules and technology platforms across the enterprise is expected to result in consistent execution of the processes and improved efficiencies. The benefits of such standardization and integration, however, depend on the scope and depth achieved in a typical enterprise system implementation. By implementing almost all the application modules that too with least amount of customization, this organization has standardized and integrated all the major processes and information across the major enterprise functions. As suggested by one respondent, simplification and standardization of repetitive processes such as procurement have helped this case study organization better and agility is not an issue there. In fact, as pointed out by another respondent, there is no need for these standard repetitive processes to be agile at all as they are not expected to change significantly In case of other non-standard processes, however the firm has implemented its old processes that have grown out of the organization that does not exist now. In certain accounting processes and information, the organization has simply converted their old paper-based \(inefficient\ses into an electronic system in ES environment. Assuming those old processes as standard has placed the organization into a tight corner with no discernable performance gains. This together with the organisational culture that has overemphasised on control in the past had made the processes so complex that it is too hard to contemplate any changes Therefore, standardization of repetitive processes that were efficient before ES implementation may have contributed to agility, but for other processes standardising them and linking with technology in ES environment made those processes very rigid and inflexible. The company therefore, is now hoping to slowly change their processes by adopting the processes embedded in the ES version in every upgrade and thereby achieve efficiencies and agility As pointed out by one respondent, standardization is good and leads to simplified processes. But, where ES is implemented without improving the process first, it has simply locked the inefficient business processes and restricted their agility  5.2. Integration & agility  Given the size of the investment and its commercial off-the shelf nature, it is necessary for an enterprise system to be adaptable to organizational conditions and structures. Once the system is configured and embedded integrating the information and processes across the enterprise horizontally, the flexibility it offers may be limited and may depend upon the scope of ES implementation. With the implementation of most of the application modules this organization has achieved full integration of its processes and information both horizontally and vertically As pointed out by one respondent, integration has enhanced their speed of execution and consistency of execution. In fact, the company s slowest processes are the ones that don t use integration of features of the enterprise system. From flexibility point of view however, integration of processes has made them less flexible. Thus, while the speed has improved, the flexibility is compromised as a result of horizontal integration of processes in this firm Integration of information and processes vertically, however, has contributed to improved decision making in this firm. Improved managerial decision making, facilitated by the standardization and integration of the information as well as processes, have contributed to agility in this organization. As noted by one respondent, if all the processes and all of the data definitions are different it is very difficult to make sense out of the reports produced by the system. In areas such as plant maintenance where there are lot of manual nonstandardized processes and data, there is no potential for agility On the other hand, in procurement process where the information and processes are fully standardized and integrated, the process is very agile, especially because of the enhanced understanding and visibility of information and process both horizontally and vertically. The richness of the information that is available and accessible has not been affected and is not considered to be a limiting factor to agility.  This study suggests that the benefits of integration are likely to vary depending upon the type and nature of integration and thus confirms the previous research 70, 51, 14  W h i l e ho r i z o nt a l i n t e gr a t i o n ha s a  m i xe d  influence on the agility, vertical integration appears to have contributed to agility in this case study While increasing the speed of process, the full horizontal integration facilitated by the enterprise systems has actually reduced the process flexibility The technical integration in this organization is not complete, with a few legacy systems still supporting certain specific applications such as laboratory information system and plant maintenance operations. The organisation is planning implementation of SAP quality management module in future. Thus, the limited technical integration Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


achieved by the enterprise system, though not restricting the agility, at present appear to have no effect on the firm s ability to build agility in their processes  5.3. Best practice processes & agility  Enterprise systems offer best practice processes It is believed that the processes embedded in the software and implemented in this organization are truly the best practices. As pointed out by one respondent, it is safe to simply adopt what enterprise system software suggests rather than changing/customizing its processes by changing the code. With continuous upgrades, these best practices are continuously improved and made available to the case study organization On an economic front also, this firm views this as a cost effective and efficient option. In any case, as observed by another senior manager, the core of the main business processes such as procure-to-pay or order-to-cash don t often change in any enterprise system software. It is expected the software vendors will take into consideration the changes in technologies, education and skill levels of typical workforce as users learn about the software, and contribute to the evolving nature of business processes. Therefore, in this organization, there is a strong belief that the best practices are truly best practices and there is no need for them to be changed regularly Any improvement in the processes consequent to the evolution of technologies, skills and practices are generally incorporated in the upgrades and newer versions. In any case, taking the business processes outside the enterprise system s environment, and changing them to deal with external demand is a very rarity in this organization, especially in case of standard transaction based processes supported by enterprise systems. Changing the business processes involves significant changes to the information technology systems, their interfaces, and organizational structures, and is generally discouraged in this organization because of the significant costs, change management efforts and particularly because it may encourage proliferation of non-standard processes, practices, technologies and systems in the enterprise. Thus, the best practices embedded in the enterprise systems do not have any specific influence on the firm s ability to build agility in their business processes. It is expected that the best practices themselves will incorporate periodic changes necessary in the processes to deal with the dynamic business requirements \(both internal and external  5.4. Process orientation and agility  Imparting process orientation is not just the work of enterprise system. Even though, implementing an enterprise system has facilitated using a common language and cooperation among all users across the organization, there is no discernable improvement in customer focus and/or holistic view. As pointed out by one manager, process view is like a motherhood statement and everybody is happy to talk about it But when it comes to do something or change their ways, or demonstrating it in practice and action, it is always challenging. While there is an evidence of some process-oriented way in the organization especially at the higher management levels, it is very much influenced by the organizational culture and management policies and practices and individual capabilities and attitude Even though achieving process orientation is an ongoing process, its influence on process agility however, is not significant. While there is some reduction of turf wars or conflicts between various functional managers, and a better appreciation of the inter-dependencies by managers across the enterprise the impact of these developments on the ability of the firm to build agility into their processes is not clear. It is, however, believed that a better understanding of the processes by the senior management have made it relatively easy to change the process components and reconfigure them to deal with the external demands if necessary  6. Conclusions  Agility of business processes is now considered important. It is expected to improve a company s ability to exploit opportunities for innovation and competitive action. While enterprise systems in the past have contributed to simplification standardization, integration and automation, their influence on the firm s ability to build agility is ambiguous and varies. In this organization, horizontal integration of processes and information has contributed to the improvement in process speed while compromising the flexibility. Vertical integration, however, has resulted in improved visibility, centralization and improved decision making, which indirectly contributes to process agility Standardization of repetitive processes that were efficient before ES implementation may have is contributed to agility in this organization. But in case Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


of other processes, standardizing them and linking with technology in an ES-enabled environment made those processes very rigid and inflexible. The best practice processes embedded in the software are considered truly best practices in this organization With regular updates ensuring the incorporation of latest developments in practices and technologies, it is generally believed that the requisite agility is also part of the best practices. This study results suggest the influence of integration and standardization characteristics on the firm s ability to build agility in their processes. The effects, however, vary depending upon the type of integration and the extent of that integration achieved by the organization after the implementation of enterprise system. While the technical tight-coupling of the enterprise system infrastructure may limit the firm s ability to build agile processes, both vertical and horizontal integration, and standardization of the processes and information appears to be contributing positively While demanding their IT infrastructures to be tightly integrated for control and visibility purposes with the help of enterprise systems, firms are seeking to deliver agility with loosely coupled systems and technologies simultaneously. Though it is considered difficult to achieve both agility and control simultaneously in the past, today introduction of web services and service oriented architecture are expected to deliver both. Recognizing the weaknesses of enterprise systems, ES software vendors and business organizations are expending a significant proportion of their IT investment in Web services and business process management technologies The leading enterprise systems software vendors such as SAP and Oracle are now incorporating Web services standards into their next generation software solutions. For example, SAP has so far delivered 1000 Web service components and recently released the first Web services enabled ES suite.

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
