However, the problem of tuning dynamic resource allocation is a novelty. Managing heterogeneous workloads running within virtual machines is an interesting and challenging topic of server virtualization. This research applied associa tion rule discovery, which is one of the data mining techniques to predict level of user access. The results illustrate that performance of the predictive model for a proxy server is 86.86%.  The performance of the predictive model for a web server is 87.18%. Additionally, user behaviors for proxy and web servers are visualized The results suggest that user behaviors are different in term of workload, day and time usage.  This preliminary study may be an approach to improve management of data cente rs running heterogeneous workloads using server virtualization 1. Introduction  Nowadays, the trend towards green computing is increasing. Green computing is defined as the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently Server virtualization on user behavior is one of the approaches toward solutions Virtualization of server resources is a method of running multiple independent virtual operating systems on a single phy sical computer.  It is a way of maximizing physical resources to maximize the investment in hardware and also a way of achieving higher server density. The concept of server virtualization can reduce the number of physical machine servers When the number of servers is reduced, it reduces energy costs. The personnel cost will also be decreased. It is an easy-care system  In this paper, we propose to use association rules for  predicting user behavior of heterogeneous workloads. In addition user behaviors on proxy servers and web servers are visually compared The paper is structured as follows: related works Section 2.  Server virtualization with mining model Section 3.

3. Server Virtualization with Mining Model  The traditionally hete rogeneous workload management for server virtualization does not consider using in user behaviour. However, we believe that there are different both times and type of services in user behaviors               F i g u r e  1   S h o w s  t h e  f r a m e w o r k  o f   s y s t e m  The Figure 1 shows the server virtualization system using data mining to pre dict user behaviors in management of heterogeneous workload.  This paper proposes primary studying user behaviors in several types of services and also studying behaviors for each period of times. We introduce new concept to improve management heterogeneous workload system, using data mining technique to predict user behaviors 4. Framework  The study consists of 3 main steps. The Figure 2 shows the framework of our system. The first step is data storage and preparation. After collected server log file and process of clea ning data have done, the  number of user accesses is counted and defined level of the access. The second is creating a system model Finally, the last step is testing the model to verify the performance of the system 4.1 Data Storage and Preparation Data from  proxy servers and web servers are collected. The Figure 3 shows the example of proxy server data.  The Figure 4 shows the example of web server data.  Typically, these access log files contain millions of records. Each record refers to a visit by a user to a certain web page served by the web and proxy servers. The data set contains one month and 13 days  The log was collected from 00:00:00 November 1, 2008 through 23:59:59 December 13 2008                            F i g u r e  2   S h o w s  t h e  f r a m e w o r k  o f  s y s t e m         F i g u r e  3   E x a m p l e  l o g  f i l e  f r o m  p r o x y  s e r v e r        F i g u r e  4   E x a m p l e  l o g  f i l e  f r o m  w e b  s e r v e r The number of user accesses in proxy servers and web servers are counted. After that, the frequencies of both the day of the week and the time are calculated. Then, levels of access are categorized into 5 levels: ‘1’ for lo w level; ‘2’ for medium low level; ‘3’ for medium level; ‘4’ for medium high level; and ‘5’ for high level. Here, the levels of access are assumed to be uniformly distributed    Server Log file Cleaning Data Count Number of Access Define Level of Access Create Model Test Model 66.249.71.38 - - [30/Nov/2008:08:01:26 -08  G ET  search.php HTTP/1.1" 200 18676 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 \(compatible Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html 66.249.71.36 - - [30/Nov/2008:08:12:12 -08  G ET  articles.php HTTP/1.1" 200 18736 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 \(compatible Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html 66.249.71.37 - - [30/Nov/2008:08:53:31 -08 G ET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1" 404 327 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 \(compatible Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html  192.168.1.9 - - [07/Dec/2008:04:32:56 +0700  G ET http://89.202.157.137/eset_eval/update.ver HTTP/1.1" 200 595 TCP_CLIENT_REFRESH_MISS:DIRECT 192.168.1.241 - - [07/Dec/2008:04:37:34 +070  P OST http://uu1.orbitdownloader.com/orbit/report_status.php HTTP/1.0" 200 247 TCP_MISS:DIRECT 192.168.1.111 - - [07/Dec/2008:05:14:36 +0700  G ET http://u38.eset.com/eset_eval/update.ver HTTP/1.1" 200 592 TCP_CLIENT_REFRESH_MISS:DIRECT Q uer y Prox y  1    2     3     4      5      6 Q uer y Web 1    2     3     4      5      6 Q uer y DataBase 1     2      3      4     5       6 Manage  Data mining Server Virtualization 


4.2 Create a System Model The relationship in the form of RHS LHS is applied for extracting rules. The extracted rules for LHS are based on days of week and 1-hour period time Let D1, D2, …, D7 be days and T1,T2, …,T24 be time. However, we restrict the RHS as follows. Let L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 be the levels of user access for the RHS that can be predicted based on the term on the LHS. Therefore, a rule k j i L T D  is created Where k L occurs most frequen tly in the rows For each rule of the form RHS LHS we define the supp and conf as the support and confidence as follows            LHS count RHS LHS count RHS LHS conf  such as    level time day conf    time day count level and time day count   2         sup All count RHS LHS count RHS LHS 3  such as   sup level time day        All count level and time day count   T a b l e  1   E x a m p l e s  o f  T o t a l  A s s o c i a t i o n  R u l e s  rule Conf  Sup  Monday , 10:00 AM=> Low 50 0.28 Monday , 10:00 AM=>   Medium Low 25 0.14 Monday , 10:00 AM=>   Low 50 0.28 Monday , 10:00 AM=>   Medium 25 0.14 Tuesday , 10:00 AM=>   Medium Low 25 0.14 Tuesday,  10:00 AM=>   Medium 50 0.28 Tuesday,  10:00 AM=>   Low 25 0.14 Tuesday,  10:00 AM=>   Medium 50 0.28  Table 1 shows examples of rules for predicting the access levels on Monday and Tuesday at 10:00 AM  Confidence and support value are used for rule selections. Because plenty of rules are generated, some simple concerns in rule selections include    1 Select the rule with maximum confidence 2 Select the rule with maximum support if confidence value is equal 3 Select the rule that happens first when confidence and support values are equal  T a b l e  2   P r e d i c t i o n  m o d e l  o f  p r o x y  s e r v e r  w i t h  c o n f i d e n c e  a n d  s u p p o r t  v a l u e s    From Table 1, some prediction rules include level  of user access from the proxy server on Monday at 10:00 AM is “Low”. Level of user access on Tuesday at 10:00 AM is “Medium Table 2 shows total association prediction model for proxy server with confidence and support values  4.3 Test model  The performance of the model was tested. In general, the data is divided into a training data set and a test data set Data obtained in November for 30 days are used to train the model while data acquired for 13 days in December are used to test the performance of the model. Note that the ratio of the training set and testing set is 70:30 An example of Table 3: model prediction using association rules on Monday 12.00 AM – 08:00 AM, the level of user access for proxy server is Low”. The rule is verified by the test model using the same day and time. The level of the user access is “Low”, which is corresponding to our generated association rule.  Therefore, the accuracy is marked as “T” \(Testing model is accurate       No. rule Conf  Sup  1 Monday ,12:00 AM   =>   Low 100 0.56 2 Monday ,01:00 AM   =>   Low 100 0.56   10 Monday ,09:00 AM   =>   Medium Low 75 0.42 11 Monday ,10:00 AM   =>   Low 50 0.28 12 Monday ,11:00 AM   =>   Medium Low 100 0.56 13 Monday ,12:00 PM   =>   Medium Low 100 0.56 14 Monday ,13:00 PM   =>   Low 100 0.56 9 Monday ,14:00 PM   =>   Medium Low 50 0.28 10 Monday ,15:00 PM   =>   Medium Low 50 0.28   168 Sunday ,23:00 PM    =>   Low 100 0.69 1 4

The rule is validated by the test model using the same day and time Level of user access is “Medium High”, which does not correspond to our rules.  Therefore, the accuracy is marked as “F” \(Test model is inaccurate                      5. Results and Discussion  The performance of the predictive model for the proxy server is 86.86 Similarly, the performance of the predictive model for the web server is measured the same way as the proxy server. The results demonstrate that the accuracy prediction of the level of user access for the web server is 87.18 User behaviors corresponding to the workload and time are displayed as in Figure 5 and Figure 6 Figure 5 shows user access behavior for the proxy server. It can be seen that during 07.00 to 16.00, user accesses are more frequent than other times for each day of the week. Nevertheless, the accesses are lower on Saturday and Sunday than other days of the week Tuesday seems to have the highest access during 07.00-16.00 Figure 6 illustrates the user access behavior for the web server. It can be interpreted that during 08:00 to 16:00, there are less frequent accesses than others time. More accesses appear after 16.00. According the graph in Figure 6, the access is peak on Monday at 19.00 In general, behavior of user access for web server is opposite to the proxy server. For example, high access in proxy server but low access in web server This implies that the workload of user behaviors is different according to the time and type of servers Understanding in user behavior could be used for workload management process This technique can improve the performance of server virtualization and may reduce the number of machines running. For example, when the proxy server utilization is high, the web server utilization is low as in Figure 5 and Fi gure 6. It is possible to aggregate two types of these services to work together in the same machine. However, factors such as CPU load, memory, and other factors should also be considered            F i  g  u r e  5   A v e r a  g  e  u s e r  a c c e s s  t o  p r o x  y   s e r v e r  o v e r  a  2 4  h o u r  p e r i o d  


                  6. Conclusions and Future work   This research applied association rules, one of the data mining techniques to predict level of user access for proxy and web server. The performances of the predicting model for proxy and web server are 86.86% and 87.18%, respectively  Moreover, the visualization approach for the proxy and web server demonstrates that user behaviors are different by times and type of services. Understanding user behaviors may improve the efficiency of heterogeneous workload management More work remains to be done. In the immediate future, we plan to investigate user behaviors focusing on data size for each period time. We also plan to study CPU and memory loads   7. References    D. Ionescu, B Solomon, M.

6 Dimensions and Facts Identifier This is the first subcomponent of the schema generator In the generatio n process of schema the first important step is the identification of dimensions and facts from the clu stered data For this important purpose the data in the sc hema generator goes to the Dimension and facts identifie r, which identifies the dimensions and facts present in the clustered data. It also identifies the cluster hierarchy and the numeric type of data which are the facts or key performance  indicators of the data Dimensions and Facts Separator The identifier component just identifies the various dimension and facts pre sent in the clustered data But in real life the dimension and the facts are to be separated in order to build the schema F or this purpose the Dimension and facts separator splits the identified dimensions and facts to be used for diff erent types of schema generation Schema Type Selector At the stage when dimensions and facts are identified and separated the Schema type selector component handles the designing of a specific type of schema This selector allows the selection of a par ticular type of schema which can be a star, snowflake or ga laxy Warehouse Builder After determining the schema type to be generated the dimensions and facts along with th e specific schema type goes in to another major and c ore unit of schema builder which is called the warehouse bui lder The warehouse builder as its name implies builds a warehouse of a particular schema type and consists of the following main sub-components. The functionality of each of the component in the warehouse builder is descri bed below Dimensional hierarchy handler It is the first component of the warehouse builder and it serves the purpose of handling the hierarchy in the dimensions As the clustered d ata has its own hierarchy and the dimensional data identifi ed and separated previously have to be in some hierarchica l order within each dimension The dimensional hierarchy is  different for different type of schemas that is why  this handler component handles the hierarchy present wit hin each dimension Dimension and fact table creator Because the warehouse builder automatically creates a warehouse in the fo rm of a database so the creation of the dimension and fact table is a must For this reason the dimension and fact table creator takes dimensional hierarchy from the previous compo nent and the facts separated by the separator component and create the tables according to the specific schema type Within each table created for a dimension the hiera rchy structure is determined and created using the hiera rchy handler output, which is different for each type of schema Table relationship manager For each type of schema the referencing of dimension and fact table is differen t. For star schema the dimensions are connected directly In Snowflake schema there exists a normalized relation ship between the dimensions whereas for Galaxy both type s of relationships are being made. To handle this comple xity of relationship among dimension and fact tables create d by the warehouse builder for a specific schema type the t able relationship manager plays its part and manages all kind of relationships among the tables accordingly Data population unit When all the tables are created along with the hierarchy within each dimension and the relationship is being created among the dimensions and fact tables, the data population unit comes into play. T he role of this unit is to load the clustered data in the sche ma intelligently Therefore this unit picks the clust ered data and inserts it in specific columns of the dimension and fact tables so that this data can be used later for the OLAP operations Schema Viewer This component takes the generated schema from the schema generator and gives the view  of the automatically generated schema in the form of s chema diagram IV IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS In this section, based on our implementation, we di scuss in details the steps involved in the implementation of  the proposed model Some tools and technologies have be en used for the implementation of each layer of the pr oposed model. Each step of the implementation phase is dis cussed individually in the following sub sections with the  help of an experiment For the experimental purpose ForestCoverType 23 d a t a  set has been chosen. This data set has 581,012 numb ers of instances and 54 attributes. The attribute breakdow n shows that it has 12 measures or facts with 54 columns of data from which 10 are quantitative variables 4 are bin ary wilderness areas and 40 binary soil type variables  The main purpose of the experiment is to demonstrate th e ability of using the proposed model with a real life data s et A Hierarchical clustering of data The proposed model starts with the layer of data mi ning and the technique used for data mining is the hierarchi cal clustering The first step of the implementation is  the hierarchical clustering of data. To serve the purpo se of step 1, we used Hierarchal Clustering Explorer \(HCE\ too l [24  for generating the hierarchical clusters of data T his tool takes input data file and allows the hierarchical c lustering of given data based on different clustering paramet ers At this point user can select the parameters of his/h er choice to perform specific type of hierarchical clustering  on the data Upon the selection of clustering parameters the data as a result is hierarchically clustered and the hi erarchy details are shown in the HCE tool We fed the ForestCoverType data set to the Hierarchical Clustering Explorer \(HCE\ tool. Various parameters can be set at this stage A visualization map of the 40 


7 ForestCoverType  data is shown in Figure 6 Appendix as an example The tool takes this data as input and produces the hierarchical clusters of data by setting different clustering parameters With the help of this tool user can see  the generated hierarchy of the clusters along with the data present in each cluster. For the experiment we sele cted the row wise clustering option and the algorithm used f or this type of clustering was the Euclidean algorithm. The reason for this choice is that Euclidean distance is the m ost commonly used type of distance measure in cluster analysis It uses raw data instead of standardized data to compute the distances Using the complete linkage method the hierarchal clusters are produced, it can be seen from the Figu re 2 that 3 distinct clusters are produced where each one of them is having its specific hierarchy B Automatic Schema generation In this step the cluster results file which was ex ported using the HCE tool becomes the input of the automat ic schema builder. We developed a prototype to automat e the process of schema generation The prototype takes t he clustered data and generates the schema of any part icular type such as star snowflake or galaxy/constellatio n The prototype has been developed using the C sharp C  programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2005 Once the hierarchical clustering has been done, the  next step is to extract this hierarchical information in the form of cluster information tables which are fed into the d eveloped prototype called Automatic Schema Generator Figure  3 depicts the main interface of the Automatic Schema Generator having the clustered relationship data C luster names are the abbreviations which are formed using the first letters of each cover type for example clus ter name for C1 is PCD, which means cover types of Ponderosa pine Cottonwood and Douglas-fir PCD All other names are abbreviated by using the first alphabetical letters  After reading the cluster relationship file the bu tton of Create Schema as shown in the following diagram displays the schema selection window. Figure 4 show s the schema selection window of automatic schema builder  Using this selector window cluster name and type o f schema can be selected to build database in the dat abase server. User can select from star, snowflake and ga laxy or constellation options of schema type using the radi o button The “Generate” button on the bottom of schema selec tor window performs the following major functions 1\Generates automatic database in the database serv er 2\Creates dimension and fact tables for the schema type selected 3\Manage relationships among the tables 4\Upload data in the fact and dimension tables from the clustered file After performing the above mentioned functions the  control is passed to the schema visualization windo w which gives a glimpse of the schema created automatically  as shown in Figure 5  Fig 2: Hierarchical clusters generated by HCE tool Fig 3 User interface of automatic schema builder Fig 4 Schema Selector window 41 


Fig 5 Schema visualization window V CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we reviewed the literature regarding  the integration of OLAP with data mining and automatic generation of OLAP schema. Literature review reveal ed the fact that none of the previous works targeted at th e automatic schema generation from the mined data set  Furthermore the works in the past pose a number of limitations. The major limitation of the previous w ork was the absence of a model that can produce the three b asic types of OLAP schema star, snowflake and galaxy Based on these observations we presented the model for th e integration of data mining and OLAP along with the automatic generation of OLAP schema. We have develop ed a prototype for the automatic schema generation Th is developed prototype takes mined data and produces t he schema of user’s choice Finally we implemented the  proposed model and evaluated the results with the h elp of experiment It is evident from the result that the prototype system overcomes the manual schema design and implementation requirement in the data warehousing environment We are working on the enhancement of t he proposed model for automatic schema generation One  possible way of enhancement is the use of other dat a mining techniques along with OLAP for the schema generation. Further more, we are exploring how OLAP can be further extended and enhanced to meet the new challenges and to make it more effective efficient  and intelligent OLAP REFERENCES 1  S   C h a u d h u r i  a n d  U   D a y a l   A n  o v e r v i e w  o f  d a t a  warehousing and OLAP technology ACM SIGMOD Record  Vol 26 1997\, pp 6574 2  A   C u z z o c r e a   D   S a c c a  a n d  P   S e r a f i n o   A  h i e r a rchy driven compression technique for advanced OLAP visualizati on of multidimensional data cubes in Proc of 8th Int’l Conf on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery \(DaWak Springer Verlag 2006\, pp. 106-119 3  S   M a n s m a n n  a n d  M   S c h o l l   E x p l o r i n g  O L A P  a g g r e gates with hierarchical visualization techniques, in Proc. of ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 2007\, pp. 1067-1073 4  F a y y a d  U  M   P i a t e s k y S h a p i n o  G    S m y t h  P   a n d  U thurusany R From datamining to knowledge discovery: An overvie w,”in Proc. of Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery MIT Press, pp. 134 5   S   G o i l  a n d  A   C h o u d h a r y    H i g h  p e r f o r m a n c e  O L AP and data mining on parallel computers Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 391-417, Dec. 1997 6   S   A s g h a r   D   A l a h a k o o n  a n d  A   H s u    E n h a n c i n g  OLAP functionality using selforganizing neural networks  Neural, Parallel and Scientific Computations vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 1-20, March 2004 7   R   B   M e s s a o u d   O   B o u s s a i d  a n d  S   R a b a s e d a    A new OLAP aggregation based on the AHC technique,” in Proc. of the 7th ACM Int’l Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP DOLAP ACM New York, 2004, pp. 65-72 8   J   H a n    T o w a r d s  o n l i n e  a n a l y t i c a l  m i n i n g  i n  l arge databases ACM SIGMOD Record vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 97-107, March 1998 9   V   M a r k l   F   R a m a s a k  a n d  R   B a y e r    I m p r o v i n g  OLAP performance by multidimensional hierarchical clustering in Proc of the 1999 Int’l Symposium on Database Engineering and Applica tions IDEAS 1999, p. 165 10   V   M a r k l  a n d  R   B a y e r    P r o c e s s i n g  r e l a t i o n a l  OLAP queries with UB-trees and multidimensional hierarchical clusteri ng in Proc of the Int’l.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
