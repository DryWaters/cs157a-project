 We propose a benchmarking technique that is combined with customerês cognitive structures Customerês cognitive struct ures are determined using a multi-dimensional scaling tool that has been often used in marketing to analyze customerês behaviors In this paper, a unique multi-dimensional scaling method is used, not only to analyze customerês behaviors, but also to perform the proposing benchmarking analysis. To do this, a survey was conducted to obtain customerês cognitive data and the Galileo method was applied to this data to obtain customerês cognitive map. A benchmarking method was then proposed based on this cognitive map. The efficacy of the proposed benchmarking method is also 
discussed with another data set   1. Introduction  Successful e-business is dependent on a deep understanding of customer s cognitive structures [1 T h e cog n iti v e s t r u ctu re of cu s t o m ers  g i v e s  entrepreneurs or practitioners a solid foundation in decision-making and that s why e-companies have invested significant resources in gaining insight into customer s cognitive domain deed m a ny  
information systems success models include users  cognitive domain as a primary element of business success. It has been assumed that benchmarking is an effective way to enhance productivity and performance in e-business w e v e r, i m itati ng the most successful e-companies does not necessarily guarantee a successful outcome. Further, imprudent imitation might lead to worse results if it has not been for a deep understanding of customers The Galileo method may assist both in enhancing 
understanding of customers and in applying the insight into practice. The Galileo method is a form of multi-dimensional scaling \(MDS\at has been used in a variety of settings including marketing research One of the important features of Galileo is that it provides a visual cognitive map, using a concept called Galileo space. In addition it has an important feature that sets it apart from other approaches because it also identifies strategies that might be useful in decision and policy-making This study will investigate and illustrate the 
potential of the Galileo method as a decision support tool and benchmarking tool   2. Background  2.1 MDS \(Multi-dimensional Scaling Methods  MDS methods are widely-used tools in marketing research [7, 8   T h e abilit y to v i s u alize th e pattern of proximities among a set of objects makes this a powerful method for studying competitive market structures, product/service positioning, market segmentation, pricing, branding and image, and advertising.  Regarding product/market positioning for example, empirical data from brand-by-brand 
proximity judgments, brand-by-attributes ratings consumer-by-brand preferences, or relevant consumer characteristics are collected and visualized such that practitioners can use the visual output to assist in decision-making  MDS methods are distinct from other empirical methods in that the overall associations among objects are established by observing proximities rather than the relations between variables.  Figure 1 shows the differences between conventional statistical methods and MDS methods.  While the 
main purpose of conventional statistical methods is to figure out the causalities or functions between variables, the purpose of MDS methods is to provide a visual representation of the pattern of similarities among objects in multi-dimensional space.  While data in conventional statistical methods show each variable, data in MDS methods show proximities Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 
 


among objects.  In the area of behavioral research, for example, each item in a questionnaire for the conventional statistical methods represents each variable, X and Y as in Figure 1.  In the MDS method however, each question asks the subjects how they would rate the proximities among objects.  Thus, the MDS method is appropriate when the aim of a study is to establish customer preferences rather than finding the answer to a question    Figure 1. Conventional statistical methods versus MDS methods  2.2 Galileo Method  The Galileo method is a specific, very powerful variant of the MDS method.  The assumption of the Galileo method that differentiates it from other MDS methods is the existence of Galileo space Events in this Galileo space correspond to events of interest in experience. The meaning of any set of objects may be represented by an N ◊ N dissimilarity \(distance matrix  In order to measure individuals perceptions of similarities \(hereafter, mental distance\mong objects, a pair-wise comparison is employ   The pair-wise comparison is known for its efficacy at measuring patterns of proximities and is similar to the metric system because both measure lengths in units am ple w e c a n s a y  concept A and concept B are 20 Galileo units \(GAL as we say the length between point C and point D is 5 inches  Once Galileo data derived from the measurement of the mental distance is transformed to a dissimilarity matrix, the matrix is projected onto coordinates so as to visualize and facilitate the analysis.  Please refer to Figure 2 for an example of output in the form of 3-d coordinates   2.3 Exploring Customer Cognitive Structure in Relation to a Website Using the Galileo Method  In a neural network, a neuron is activated when it is stimulated and it sends signals to other neurons to which it is conn W h en an in di v i du al  perceives an object, neurons concerned with that type of perceptual information are activated with weight The network consisting of the weighted connections and nodes can be easily found in our everyday lives For example, once pizza pops up in one s mind associated words or images of objects such as coke  lunch  cheese delicious  hot and tomato  might also pop up in one s mind, either strongly or weakly.  Once the network is formed, it is referred to as a perceptual map, and a cognitive structure can be figured out through the perceptual mapping process Similarly, when a customer faces a commercial site, associated images such as price reasonability information appropriateness, secured privacy, and interface clarity will be activated, together with strong or weak ties.  If Galileo space is assumed for this network, and if the nodes and connections are expressed as a vector, such images \(objects\ be positioned in the Galileo space with visually depicted distances.  That is, a short distance means a strong connection to each other and a long distance means a weak one   Figure 2. Chrisê perceptual map about pizza  The Galileo method is a useful means of visually depicting the cognitive structure.  Figure 2 shows an example of a perceptual map containing pizza  coke  lunch  cheese delicious  hot and tomato From Figure 2, we can easily see that Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 
 


Chris thinks of delicious the most when he perceives pizza by observing the shortest distance between them.  In the map, the distance between two small cubes labeled by object names is the mental distance within an individual s perceptual map  3. Research Methods  3.1 Object, attributes, and their perceptual distances  A cognitive structure about a commercial website and its attributes is represented in a network of associations between the website and its attributes Figure 3a shows an example of simple associations consisting of one object and two attributes.  For example, assume that the object corresponds to a commercial website attribute 1 corresponds to delicious and attribute 2 corresponds to sale    Figure 3a. Commercial website and its attributes   Figure 3b. Comparing distances between an attribute and two different commercial sites Then, the lengths of the lines tell us that there is a stronger association between the commercial website and attribute 1 and the commercial website and attribute 2 Attributes can be any concept that practitioners want to research e.g interface clarity, trust, and information quality  Figure 3b shows the concept applied to more than one object where the second object is the target commercial website  3.2 Data split in the Galileo method  Group differences such as gender and age within subjects can result in different patterns of dissimilarity among a set of objects in a cognitive network structure. For example, while a male group may prefer blue shirts to pink shirts, a female group may prefer pink shirts to blue shirts. As a more complex example, a group preferring site A to site B may think the fast loading speed of a commercial website is a more plausible reason to revisit it than the security of the site Data split is enabled by a categorical variable.  In addition to the mental distance measurement in the Galileo method, a conventional rating scale such as Likert might also be useful if needed.  If data in a column is categorical, Galileo data can be divided by the categories. Data split implies that the Galileo method and conventional statistical method can be combined  3.3 Strategy generation  The purpose of benchmarking is to shorten customer s mental distance from the target commercial websites in a perceptual map. Shortening the mental distance can sometimes be achieved by marketing strategies such as appropriate advertisements and benchmarking.  This section will discuss how such strategies can be generated The basic concept of strategy generation is to show how a point associated with other points can be repositioned in a method of vector analysis in a  Con c epts represen ted as  points in a Galileo space are interrelated to each other and any changes in their connections \(distances\ will affect associated connections  [1 u r e 4 s h o w s  the process of generating strategies to shorten the mental distance between two objects.  For clarity, the vectors/points in Figure 4 are depicted on a 2dimensional plane, instead of multi-dimensional space Points from A through H refer to each concept, and distances among those points represent Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 
 


 Figure 4a. Current state and a goal    Figure 4b. Finding the vector resultant closest to the target  Figure 4c. Generating strategies   Figure 4d. Expectant result   the mental distances drawn from measurements Note that the two big dots and small dots represent objects \(websites in this case\d attributes respectively and also that there are Me \(O to be repositioned and Target Figure 4a represents the current state and a goal.  Including O \(Me and Target each point is positioned with a certain amount of distance from other points As in Figure 4a, the first step of strategy generation is to set a target.  The goal is to shorten the distance between Me and Target represented with block arrows. The next step is to find the vector resultant closest to the target point.  The vector sum of two or more vectors will be compared to find the closest point.  Point R is set to the most appropriate vector resultant in this example, as in Figure 4b Once the resultant, magnitude of OR is found, it can be reduced by division. Block arrows in Figure 4c show the strategies. In Figure 4d  OR represents the reduced magnitude. In decision-making with respect to marketing strategy, persuasive messages dealing with the distances between Me and A  B and C can shorten customer s mental distance between Me and Target For example, it would be a good strategy for a company Me dvertise that Me  is good at A  B and C or simply show A  B  and C a lot.  Barnett et al s h o w ed th at v o ters  attitudes were changed by persuasive messages using this algorithm   4. Benchmarking Design, Results and Analysis  In this study, customer s cognitive structures regarding site K and site N are compared in various ways using the Galileo method. This is followed by a discussion of how this method can be used as a benchmarking technique Site K and site N are two leading farm product e-commerce sites in South Korea.  Both sites opened for business in the same year, 2001, and deal with similar products on a similar scale and scope Site K and site N are to be objects in the cognitive structure network As a possible benchmarking analysis, e-business success factors were selected. It should be noted that the following is just an example that was applied using the proposed benchmarking method    Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 
 


Table 1. E-commerce success factors in this study and the literature This study McKinney et al   Garrity et al   Wang et al   Liu Amett 21  Ease of use Usability Interface satisfaction Ease of use System design Structured interface  Navigation Fast loading speed Access Timely information  Innovation information and service quality Accurate information Reliability  Information Contents Understan dability Assists in purchase decision Usefulness Decision Support Satisfaction  adequate customer service  Task Support Satisfaction Customer Support  information assurance   Security System use Transaction Payment  Like other MDS methods, the Galileo method doesn t take functionality into account. Thus, the independent and dependent variables are not distinguished, instead only the proximities among objects are considered. Eight attributes \(attributive objects\d two objects were measured using paired answers; that is, out of ten, subjects were required to choose two.  In addition to the 45 paired question items, questions asking for demographic information and preferences for two commercial websites on ebusiness success indices such as trust, intent to revisit and intent to purchase, were added to the questionnaire Data was collected from 70 participants. For 10 objects, more than 30 samples are necessary s  the sample size increases, the standard error measure will decrease and the reliability coefficients will increase positively because of the shrinkage in the variance about the mean in the population 7 0  samples were enough to produce reliable results Subjects had no purchase experience from either commercial website and thus there was no prior preference through familiarity  4.1 The first step: choosing attributes to consider in the analysis  In order to perform a benchmarking analysis using the MDS method, attributes needed to be chosen. In this study, eight elements were used as success factors. These were ease of use, structured interface, fast loading speed, timely information accurate information, assists in purchase decision adequate customer service, and information assurance. These factors were derived from literature on success factors; each factor is mutually exclusive The eight success factors used are shown in Table 1   4.2 The second step: creating a perceptual map  A graphical perceptual map helps the practitioner to understand how customers perceive the attributes of the designated the target e-commerce websites attributes at a glance. Data split was performed to achieve effective identification, the first stage of benchmarking. Several strategies to lessen the distance from the target will be suggested using the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 
 


Galileo algorithm.  In this study, the superior website in each comparison was assumed to be the target The most fundamental output of the Galileo method is a mean distance  matrix In th e m a trix   the means of distances are computed for every pair of objects based on responses. This matrix is projected onto coordinates to provide a visualized perceptual map. Figure 5 is a screen shot of the perceptual map depicting the K site the N site and the eight attributes representing e-commerce success factors Note that the perceptual distances between concepts are distances between small cubes The perceptual map projected onto the coordinates in Figure 5 was rotated from its initial state so as to be more easily viewed. Contrary to other MDS methods, it is possible to manipulate the map to achieve the best visual angle to work with when the Galileo method is used [23   According to the perceptual map depicted in Figure 5, customers perceive timely information and assists in purchase decision to be closely related Another notable finding is the close association between ease of use and structured interface therefore, it appears that customers believe that, if the interface of an e-commerce website is well-structured the website will be easy to use.  Timely information and assists in purchase decision are clustered in one group, and ease of use and structured interface are clustered in another group.  These groups can be used as criteria for decision-making.  Structured interface and adequate customer service are close to both the K site and the N site whereas fast loading speed and information assurance are far from both sites This means that both e-commercial websites have well-structured interfaces and provide adequate customer service but have weaknesses in loading speed and in security and protection of customer s privacy   4.3 The third step: comparing mental distances  4.3.1. Each success factor versus both e-commerce websites The first step in benchmarking is to identify one s own strengths or weaknesses against others T h e m e ntal di s t an ce s obs erv e d f r o m  customers provide information about the gap between one e-commerce website and another for each success factor. Table 2 shows the mean distances between each attribute and both the K site and the N site A t-test was applied to compare the mean distances.  Each bar refers to a distance; the shorter the bar, the stronger the association. The numbers next to each bar are the means of distances, and the numbers in parentheses are the standard deviations  In the t-test, the two sites showed significant difference for two attributes, ease of use and structured interface at 0.1. Thus, customers perceive that the N site is more usable and has better structure than the K site The websites were not significantly different in the other attributes i.e Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 
 


fast loading speed, timely information, relevant information, assists in purchase decision, adequate customer service, and information assurance. Thus the weaknesses of the N site against the K site  can be said to be usability and interface structure   4.3.2. Comparing various perceptual maps discerned by data split  A perceptual map is a visual representation of the mean matrix. Thus, it is possible for two different groups, such as male and female to have different cognitive structures when two mean matrices are different. Suppose that N site is more successful in revenues and all success factors attributes\er to the N site than to K site  Then, practitioners of the K site may decide to benchmark the N site After the data split, however if it is revealed that most customers of the K site  are women and those female customers perceive the K site as better in success factors; it might not be the best solution for the K site to benchmark the N site In this case, if the K site follows the N site  then the K site might lose its female customers  Splitting data by individual characteristics can help to find very different perceptual maps that otherwise cannot be found. In addition to the example of gender, moderating factors such as hours of internet usage, experience of TV home shopping, and experience of e-commerce shopping were used as criteria to split the Galileo data in this study Table 3 shows the results from the data split. Only significantly different pairs are presented. Table 3 is attached at the end of this paper By splitting the Galileo data, two groups for each criterion were determined.  Then, two distances, one between an attribute and an object K site and N site respectively\ by one split group and the other between the same attribute and the same object by another split group were compared using a t-test This data split and t-test comparison was performed for all eight attributes. The attribute-object pairs showing significant differences between two split groups are listed in Table 3 For the gender difference, female respondents showed a more favorable perception of the speed of both sites than male respondents. This implies that women care less about the loading speed of a commercial website than men do When the Galileo data is split by TV home shopping experience, customers with no experience perceived the security of both sites more favorably When the Galileo data was split by e-commerce shopping experience, customers with no experience perceived the ease of use of both sites more favorably Also, customers without e-commerce shopping experience perceived the information timeliness of K site more favorably than customers with experience Practitioners may not know why an e-commerce website is preferred by customers. In this study, for Cartesian pairs  K site  N site versus attributes the Galileo data  was split into two on the basis of the responses to the evaluative questions, such as usability, trust, purchase intent, and revisit intent For example, in order to know customer s preferences about trust, we asked Which site do you trust more, the K site or the N site  Then, we divided the respondents into two groups; K group and N group, according to their stated preference. Table 4 shows the results of the comparisons between the K group and N group. \(Table 4 is also attached at the end of this paper\ each pair - attribute and K site  N site the mental distances of the K group and N group were compared using a t-test. Also, for each of K group and N group, two distances, an attribute versus K site and N site were compared using a t-test.  No significant differences were found in the latter t-test. Thus, we can conclude that participants don t perceive a difference between the two sites in terms of the eight attributive characteristics when they are split based on usability Pairs, structured interface and K site timely information and K site relevant information and K site assists in purchase decision and K site  assists in purchase decision and N site adequate customer service and K site and adequate customer service and N site showed statistically significant differences by both K group and N group at the at 0.05 or 0.01 For the first pair, structural interface and K site  in Table 4, the K group and N group showed significantly different cognitive structure.  That is customers who think that the usability of the K site  is better than that of the N site and customers who think that the usability of the N site is better than that of the K site have quite different feelings about the interfaces of the two sites On the other hand, the K group and N groups showed no statistically significant difference for the pair, structural interface versus N site Therefore both groups perceive the interface of the N site in the same way The other pairs can be interpreted similarly. In usability, it was found that the two groups perceive the information timeliness, information relevancy, the degree of assist for purchase decision and the adequacy of customer service differently Information relevancy in particular, was very differently perceived by the two groups.  Therefore we can conclude that information relevancy is a key factor influencing customer s evaluations of usability Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 
 


A further interesting finding was that feelings about the K site for both the K and N groups varied more for all the attributes. Thus, there is a possibility that a certain amount of customers are locked in the K site   4.4 The fourth step: persuasive strategy generation  The purpose of benchmarking is to shorten customer s mental distance from the target commercial website in a perceptual map. As mentioned earlier, shortening the mental distance can sometimes be achieved by marketing strategies such as appropriate advertisements and benchmarking In this study, the result of the vector analysis is as follows Start concept:  K site Target concept: N site  INITIAL     =       34.460 MINIMUM =       16.100 25.583        fast loading speed 38.333        relevant information 36.083        information assurance The initial mental distance between the two sites was 34.46, and the distance can be shortened to 16.10 using a strategy of generating messages about fast loading speed, relevant information, and information assurance. In practice, the practitioners of the K site  need to focus on enhancing customer s perceived loading speed, information relevancy, and information assurance  5. Discussion  A benchmarking technique is not a panacea. The proposed benchmarking technique shows a very helpful guideline of not only how and what to benchmark but also whether to benchmark or not In order to intuitively verify the efficacy of the proposed benchmarking technique, we collected another data set for Google.com and Yahoo.com with the attributes of EQ model T h e attribu t able  concepts are accurate information  relevant information  complete information  structured layout  packaged layout  accessible layout  history of information  sequential delivery of information and current information  Figure 6 shows very close distance of Google and Yahoo even though characteristics of them are very different. This apparently tells us that neither of them needs to benchmark the other Besides the above implication, we can also imply that there should be very small lock-in effect. In other words, internet users use of search engine is versatile   Figure 6. Perceptual map on Google / Yahoo   6. Conclusion  This paper has explored customer s cognitive structure by generating a perceptual map using the Galileo method. The applicability of the Galileo method to benchmarking technique was demonstrated by identifying strengths and weakness against other commercial websites and generating strategic messages on the basis of customer s cognitive structure. Two leading farm product e-commerce sites were used A survey was conducted to obtain customer s perceptions. Several practical implications were found Firstly, the Galileo method provides a visual representation that helps decision-makers to identify the current state at the first site. The Galileo method was applied to the K site  N site and e-business success factors to explore how customers perceive them. The generated customer perceptual map illustrates the mental distances for how well a company is managing the e-commerce website in terms of attributes that customers think important When we want to know the physical distances between cities, we use a map.  Likewise, customer s perceptual relationships among objects/concepts can be observed much more efficiently with a visual representation Secondly, the Galileo method can be used as a tool for detailed benchmarking planning Benchmarking can be very costly. Thus, selective benchmarking is critical to a firm. The data splits Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 
 


shown in this paper offer guidelines for selective decision-making The Galileo method is one type of MDS tool. The functions and features of the Galileo are straightforward: visual representation of customer s cognitive structure. However, the applicable potential of the tool is infinite. Benchmarking techniques suggested by this paper are the first step in analyzing customer s small but never-trivial perceptions and feelings towards an e-business and in helping practitioners to make sound marketing decisions  6.

events, which leads to right censoring.  Similarly, there are left censoring, random censoring, and interval censoring Censoring creates significant challenges to traditional reliability analysis and PHM, nevertheless, much of the theoretic research on survival analysis has been focused on better addressing the censoring issues. Therefore, it can be said, when coming to dealing with censoring, survival analysis, including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis offer the best solutions  3 Hazards models and Accelerated Failure Models offer powerful techniques for modeling time and covariates dependent hazard and survivor \(reliability are much more flexible and powerful than those used in traditional reliability analysis  4 for both individual and population level modeling.

                                Box 3.1. Basics of Survival Analysis  A comprehensive discussion of this topic in the context of PHM can be found in Ma and Krings \(2008a Survival analysis, also known as failure time analysis, has become a de facto standard for analyzing time-to-event data in biomedical research in the last two decades Survival analysis studies positive random variables for describing times to events in concern, also known as survival time, failure time, or simply time-to-event  Survivor Function and Hazard Function  Survivor function and hazard function are two of the most fundamental definitions in survival analysis.

This forms the foundation of tactical level modeling in the three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008  3.2. Competing Risks Analysis  Competing risks analysis \(Box 3.2; Ma &amp; Krings 2008b for detailed discussion in the context of PHM and reliability subject of survival analysis. It has a history dating back to 1760 when Daniel Bernoulli studied the risks around the smallpox inoculation. However, modern competing risks analysis draw extensively on survival analysis, which was only initiated in late 1950s but the active research was not conducted until the1970s The application of competing risks analysis in reliability is quite earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 


earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 1967 controversies around the issues of identifiability, which shadows its value when multiple latent risks are dependent.  Three excellent monographs exist for competing risks analysis \(David &amp Moeschberger 1978, Crowder 2001, Pintilie 2006 perspective of survivability analysis, competing risks analysis can be used for analyzing the effects of unpredictable risks by treating the unpredictable events as censored or the effects of latent risks We use the term latent risks to refer to potential failure risks \(but only one of the risks ultimately causes the system failure survivability analysis; this usage of latent risks is totally consistent with the concept of latent risks in competing risks analysis, where these risks are modeled precisely  3.3.

Basics of the Competing Risks Analysis \(CRA  In competing risks analysis \(CRA experiences multiple risks simultaneously, but it may fail from one of the risks only and fail only once. The risk that leads to the failure becomes the cause of the failure Therefore, risk is often used before the failure occurs and the cause is preserved for the afterwards \(Crowder 2001 failure is the defining characteristic of competing risks analysis. It also implies that the system is multivariate from the perspective of risks, but univariate from the perspective of the single failure time and single cause  There are two sets of formulations for CRA in the literature. The first is described with a pair of vectors of random variables the latent \(theoretical David and Moeschberger 1978 used below well as sub-survival functions \(Crowder 2001  There is one and only one cause in the set of k causes for each failure observed.  The elements of C are called risks before failures and causes afterwards. The risks compete for the cause. In reliability analysis, C might be faulty components in a series system and T is the breakdown time of the system; or C might be the failure modes, such as asymmetric vs. symmetric  The sub-distribution function is defined as   tTjCtjF equivalently, the sub-survivor function is defined as   tTjCtjS &gt Obviously jptjFtjS   where   jSjFjCp j represents the marginal distribution of C

Similarly Pr\(cause j | time t specific age group 9 The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multi-state modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multi-state models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and PHM. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one reference in the form of monograph, i.e., by Hougaard 2000 analysis in the context of reliability and PHM can be found in Ma &amp; Krings \(2008c 2008d frailty and multi-state modeling, respectively. Given the complexity involved with multivariate survival analysis, any description of actual model is quite involved and hard to fit in a comment box. Box 3.3 only contains a few concepts  The previous univariate survival analysis and, to a lesser extent, the competing risks analysis have several significant limitations. The first limitation is the implicit assumption of single failure or single time-to-event transition. In Figure 2 multiple states and multiple transitions are the norm, rather than the exception. This is a multivariate survival system and multi-state modeling is obviously more appropriate than the univariate or competing risks analysis. Competing risks analysis can only address the multiple risks, but not multiple failures, which further can be dependent with each other. In more general terms, multiple failures with common-events modes represent the typical failure mechanisms in a multivariate system, but both univariate survival analysis and competing risks analysis can help little in modeling the dependences This constitutes the second limitation.  A third limitation is that not all covariates are observable, and some of the unobservable or unobserved may have critical influences on the 'survival' \(or transitions between states nodes. These unobservable covariate factors may create common-risks dependences, and the shared frailty model can capture these kinds of unobservable common-risks While the capability to capture the effects of unobserved or unobservable common-risks is critical for reliability modeling, its criticality to survivability modeling cannot be overemphasized because the quantitative study of this issue does not exist in the existing survivability research Therefore, shared frailty modeling is a critical tool for studying the influences of UUUR events in the tactical level modeling of survivability  Of course, the above limitations discussed equally apply to the traditional reliability theory because traditional reliability theory is based on the binary-state logic \(either failed or operational especially of computer networks, is often characterized by 


especially of computer networks, is often characterized by the multi-state performance degradations before reaching the complete failure. This multi-state nature of reliability has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and the most significant advances have been in the field of multistate reliability modeling \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003                                                 4. STRATEGIC MODELING AND DYNAMIC   Box 3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis  Dependence Mechanisms  Dependence is often the central focus of multivariate survival analysis, and together with censoring, they complicate survival analysis most significantly. Hougaard \(2000 three mechanisms of dependence: \(i ii iii Common events are equivalent to common mode failures in reliability analysis, for example, failure events due to accidents or natural disasters. The common risks mechanism describes the scenario that the individuals are dependent due to some common unobserved risks such as common genes in siblings or a bug in the operating system that may affect all software running on 


operating system that may affect all software running on it. The third mechanism, event-related mechanism refers to the phenomena that the actual event itself changes the risk, such as virus infection of a computer node Shared Frailty Modeling  Shared frailty theory occupies the central focus of multivariate survival analysis. The dominance is not accidental because frailty captures crucial but often directly unobservable \(latent random variables, which are attributable for dependence and variations. To some extent, dependence, variation randomness, and frailty all address some facets of multivariate failure events. The frailty theory provides a unique set of approaches to address the theoretical and practical issues related to those four concepts.  Similar to the fact that censoring is the trademark feature of survival analysis \(both univariate and multivariate frailty theory is the trademark of multivariate survival analysis. These two trademark properties, censoringhandling and frailty modeling, have made multivariate survival analysis a unique and indispensable mathematical tool for biomedical and public health research Multi-State Modeling  Multi-state has been developed concurrently in several fields in the last decade, including survival analysis \(Hougaard 2000 reliability \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003 Commenges 1999 Huzurbazar 2006 multi-state modeling has been adopted to solve the domain specific problems, and the flow graph modeling offers a flexible and powerful approach to analyze multi-state models in general. Multi-State model is often formulated as Markov Process models. The transition probabilities in multi-states modeling are well defined by survivor functions \(Hougaard 2000 multi-state model is to estimate the state transition probabilities from hazards functions. multivariate system. According to Lisnianski and Levitin's \(2003 any systems that can have a finite number of performance rates are multi-state systems. Furthermore a system may consists of components which themselves could be multi-state subsystems 10 4. STRATEGIC LEVEL MODELING AND DYNAMIC HYBRID FAULT MODELS  Hybrid fault models are derived from agreement algorithms Lynch 1997 redundancy management in fault tolerance.  Therefore, the choice of hybrid fault models directly affects reliability analysis and fault tolerance. Despite the close ties between reliability and fault tolerance fields, Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e Ma 2008a with regard to the quantitative relationship between reliability analysis and hybrid fault models. To address the unrealistic assumption, they proposed a new concept  dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF mathematical tools \(survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling we first briefly describe the issues involved and summarize some of their key findings in Box 4.1  Agreement algorithms started out with the introduction of the Byzantine general problem by Pease et al. \(1980 Lamport \(1982 system are abstracted as generals of an army.  Loyal generals \(non-faulty components algorithm e.g., to attack or retreat while traitors \(or bad components others by sending conflicting messages. Because the focus of agreement algorithms is to reach agreement in the presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the 


presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
