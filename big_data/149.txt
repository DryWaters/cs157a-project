Loparo, Fellow, IEEE \nAbstract-Today's power systems are undergoing an evolu­\ntionary transformation where novel sensors, organized as sensor \nnetworks are providing tremendous amounts of real-time data \nthat is useful for improving situational awareness. It is becoming \nincreasing evident in large-scale power systems, as in many other \napplications, that the associated big data is both an opportunity \nand a challenge. In this paper we describe an approach that \nmerges important concepts from information theory, applied \nto cyber-physical systems \(CPS modeling large-scale cyber-physical systems, referred to as \nSystem Structure. An important aspect of the proposal approach \nis the interpretation of a large-scale cyber-physical system as \nan information processing network, where System Structure \nprovides an approach for quantify interactions between nodes \nin the network through the computation of system measures. \nIndex Terms-hybrid dynamical system, power system, stabil­\nity nI. INTRODUCTION \nThe electric power system is a large-scale cyber-physical \nsystem with a diverse range of multi-scale dynamic system \nbehaviors. Of particular note is the dynamic interaction of the \nstate \(voltage current and frequency network \ntopology beginning to undergo a transformation, often referred to \nas "smart grid," that includes a proliferation of sensing, \ncommunications and processing systems that will increase the \nfunctionality and, thereby the complexity, of the system. In \nthese Systems of Systems \(SoS interactions between the constituent components \nand subsystems that render traditional reductionist approaches \ninadequate. \nIn this paper we present a framework where information \ntheory can be merged with a novel computational methods \nfor characterizing the behavior of complex cyber-physical \npower systems. with particular emphasis on using new sources \nof system data \(e.g., synchro-phasors nawareness. \nII. PRELIMINARIES \nA. Systems and Information Structure \nThe development of an information-theoretic architecture \nexploits the properties of information to deduce a useful struc-\nFig. 1 nInputs From \nEnvironment System r \nOutputs To \nEnvironment \nSystem Schematic and Organization of System Variables \nture for information flow and management. The properties of \ninformation provide a fundamental basis for the decomposition \nof systems [1] and hence a structure for the transmission and \ncombination of observations at desired levels of resolution that \nare not necessarily tied to the state of specific subsystems \nor sensors but rather to a more general notion of overall \nsystem state [2].. The basic idea is that the generalization \nof information theory to N -dimensions can be viewed as a \nstatistical analysis tool for understanding systems in terms of \nthe information geometry of its variables. \nMajor advantages of the information-theoretic approach \nover other statistical analysis techniques are; 1 and analysis of rates of constraints \(i.e., \nconditioned on history ndecomposition follows from the decomposition of constraints \nprovided by the axiomatic properties of information \(i.e., \nadditivity and branching nvariability of a system and relationships between its disparate \nvariables but must be modified for application to dynamical \nsystems to account for constraints on present values based \nupon past history of the system [1]. These constraints can \nbe described by the entropy rate, defined as the entropy \nof a variable X conditioned on all of its prior values. An \nalternative formulation is available by recognizing that the ntotal uncertainty of a long sequence \(Xl, X2, ... , Xn> is \nthen \(approximately length of the \nsequence.

Transactional Dynamics and System Structuring \nPower systems are large-scale complex CPS with power \nflows that are highly dependent on network topology of \nthe physical system and the relationship between electrical \npower angles and voltages throughout the system. Automated \nequipment monitors and adjusts the system to mitigate dis­\nturbances and provide protection on fast time scales, and \nhuman operators provide supervisory control on slower time \nscales Stochastic hybrid dynamical systems theory provides \nthe proper framework for the monitoring and control of power \nnetworks, but the direct application of such methods are \nlimited due to grid size and complexity [3 Current efforts \nseek to mitigate the limitations of analysis by combining \ninnovative data analytics for integrative analysis. \nWithin the context of an information-theoretic framework, \nthe purpose of the algorithms developed here is to deter­\nmine which data streams contain mutual information \(i.e." \ncommunicate similar information ninformation in the context of the application. The resulting \ninformation geometry illuminates which data streams are re­\nlated to the same phenomena or processes and thus provides a \nlevel of redundancy and robustness, which sets of data streams \ncan be examined in isolation and thus can be used as a basis \nfor partitioning, and the amount to which the disparate pro­\ncesses and phenomena communicate with one another either \nthrough the cyber, physical and/or communications networks. \nAn innovative aspect of the information-theoretic approach \nadopted in this work, is that information dependencies can \noccur as a result of both physical and cyber \(computation and \ncommunication ntraditional systems theoretic concepts of limited scope. \nOur approach relies on the concept of System Structure, a \nsystems analysis method that is computationally efficient, and \nthat scales well with size [4 System Structure is a novel \nset-theoretic model for complex systems that is based on the \nidea that systems are generated by a network of interactions \nbetween constituent system objects [4]-[ 10]. System Structure ndoes not assume a restrictive a priori network model or make \nspecific assumptions about the stochastic process underlying \nthe network formation and yet provides a systematic quan­\ntification of linear and nonlinear relations between system \nobjects. Set theoretic relations are defined based on first princi­\nples and are used, through an iterative computational schema, \nto compute potentials, respectively called node and arc system \nmeasures, for system objects and for their inter-relations [4]. \nThis weighted network, also referred to as System Structure, \nprovides an informative basis for inference about a complex \nsystem and about its substructures: Node system measures \nquantify the system wide influence of the system objects, and narc system measures quantify the system significance of the \nassociation between interacting system objects relative to all \nassociations in the entire network. These measures can be \nused, in conjunction with different post processing methods, \nfor the discovery of coherent groups, classification, time series nanalysis and for pathway analysis [4]-[10]. \nFor the analysis of large-scale CPS, System structure anal­\nysis can provide useful information about how the system is \norganized from analysis of observed data, for discovering how \npatterns of observed data can be used to improve situational \nawareness. The example given next, provides preliminary data \nin support of this objective. \nIII. IMPROV ING SITUATIONAL AWARENESS \nOur approach to improving situational awareness is illus­\ntrated using a simulated power system. \nA.

This npre-processing step ignores direction information, which is \nrestored at the end of Step 2. \n2 System Structure: A bipartite network is defined \nfor each time series, with one set of nodes representing the ntime epochs of the data and, another, the distinct set of angle \nmeasurements at buses Gl, G2, G3, and G4 System measures \nare obtained for each angle node, each time node, and for each \ncorresponding angle. \nAngle system measures gauge the global significance of \nepoch specific patterns. Direction information is retrieved by \nintroducing two types of angle nodes G+ and G-. A time \nepoch is connected to a G+ node if the corresponding angle \nis positive with the connecting arc weighted by the associated \nangle system measure Similarly, a time epoch is connected \nto a G- node if the corresponding angle is negative when \nweighted by the associated angle system measure. \nAngle \(Generator locations Gl, G2, G3, and G4 in the small signal \nstability case 1 are approximately 94.3, 94.5, 149.5, and 865 \nrespectively. This indicates that over the entire time series, G 1 \nand G2 are similar in significance Furthermore, since System \nStructure is a diffusion process and the underlying network is \nfully connected this implies Gland G2 are strongly related. In \ncontrast, the node system measures for transient stability case \n1 are 105.6, 119.2, 134.4, and 11030. Thus all four generators \nare expected to exhibit slightly different behavior with Gland \nG2 having somewhat similar behavior, G2 and G3 exhibiting \nsimilar behavior in subsequences, G4 having distinct behavior. \n". \n0> \n.. .. .. .. \nI j \n11llllllli I I I I \n"1 II Ii . , ?

Exploratory Analysis of System Measures as Indicators of Episodic \nSystem Behavior \nDuring time periods with oscillations, system measures are \nindicative of phase coupling. This pattern is illustrated in \nFig. 5, where the initial few epochs, up to 1 second, exhibit \nnear constant positive power angles for G 1 and G2, and near \nconstant negative values for G3 and G4. The associated system \nmeasures are dominated by angle system measures of negative \nangle values at location G4 \(G4 seconds, angle system measures \nassociated with G 1 + and G2+ are both significant indicating \nsynchrony between the two power angles at the measurement \nlocations G 1 and G2 in the positive direction. Over the same ntime period there is evidence of synchrony between the power \nangles at measurement locations G3 and G4 in the negative \ndirection. \nSignificant system measures associated with Gi+ and Gi­\npower angles over the same time period indicate phase cou­\npling between the pair. Thus significant measures of the pairs \nG 1 +, G2+ and G3-, G4- over the same time epochs imply \nthat the pairs of power angles at the Gl and G2 measurement nlocations swing with each in the positive direction, while \npower angle pair at measurement locations G3 and G4 swing \ntogether in the negative direction. There is a period of near \nzero oscillation around 2.558 seconds. This near constant \(am­\nbient ncoupling between power angles at the Gland G2 measurement \nlocations in the positive direction, and power angles at the \nmeasurement locations G3 and G4 in the negative direction. \nAngle system measures provide evidence of oscillation and \ncoupling in the angles measured for the transient stability case \nover a selected time period \(Fig. 5, Right panel Step \n4. \n3 measures provide a \nuseful representation of the time series, uncovering significant \nTABLE I \nINTER GENERATOR MEASURES FOR SMALL SIGNAL STABILITY CASE 1 \nTABLE II \nINTER GENERATOR MEASURES FOR TRANSIENT SIGNAL STABILITY nCASE 1 \npatterns in the temporal progress of the system. At the current \nstep, angle system measures are further analyzed in making \ninferences about inter-power angle relations based on the entire \ntime series nSystem Structure measures take values in [0, 1], and rela­\ntional values can be computed between each pair of power \nangles as a sum of the product of their respective system \nmeasures with specific time epoch nodes, and then processed \nto obtain associated system measures. These time epoch nodes \nmay correspond to selected subsequences or to the complete \ntime series. \nGlobal inter-power angle system measures, based on small nsignal stability case 1 confirm inferences drawn from angle \nsystem measures \(see table I system measure of \n0.6059 indicates that G 1 + and G2+ are coupled in the positive \ndimension, and G3- and G4are coupled in the negative \ndimension with an associated measure of 0.0422. Furthermore, \nG1+ and G2+ are coupled with G3- with 0.0175 and 0.0518 \nrelational system measures, respectively. Also G4- is coupled \nto G2 with stronger coupling G2- \(system measures of 0.0002 \nand 0.5527 respectively. \nAs expected, system structure based global analysis captures \ninter-power angle relations prevalent over the entire time series \nwith higher system measure values, and the inter-relations \nobserved only over shorter subsequences with lower values nThe measure values also gauge the degree of coupling and are \nnot dependent on the period of observation. For example, in the \ntransient stability case 1, see table II, G3- is coupled to G 1 + \nand G2+ with measure values 0.1539 and 0.2755 respectively; \nG3- is also coupled to G4- with 0.2245 system measure value. \nAlso G2- and G 1- are coupled at 0.5384. These patterns can \nbe observed over much of the time series \(See Fig. 5 Top \nLeft subsequences. The coupling \nbetween G 1 + and G2+ is intennittent over the time series and \nis accorded a lower measure value of 0.0023. Note that table I \nand table II essentially provide weighted connection matrices \nthat capture the information structure of the power system. \n4 Global analysis of the \nentire time series provides a good overview of patterns and \ninter-relations between power angles evidenced over a length \nof time. However it is useful to consider transitional analysis \nboth as a gauge of system health and as a basis for control \ninterventions. In this subsection some simple rules and tech­\nniques are developed for identification of atypical periods of \nsystem behavior, and for analysis of changing inter-relations \nbetween power angles over these periods. It is also conjectured \nthat an abrupt change, however slight, from a state of near \nconstant pattern in the system measures is indicative of a fault nor of an abrupt change in the dynamic behavior of the system, \ndue to episodic system behavior of load shifts and faults. \nI . \n nFig. 6. Transitional System Analysis \nHigher angle system measure values are observed across \nangle 


measurement locations during oscillatory activity in a \nperturbed system. It thus follows that mean system measures, \ncomputed independently for each epoch, and scaled by cor­\nresponding variability may provide a good indicator of the \nstate of the system. Abrupt changes are simply identified by \nlocating a sudden drop or increase in scaled mean system mea­\nsures following an extended period with near constant value. \nStatistical techniques such as change point detection can be \nvery useful for this task. Time periods of atypical activity are \nidentified as time epochs that exhibit higher values of scaled or \nstandardized system measures. Clearly this description is not \nunambiguous and requires arbitrary definitions. Future work \nwill involve development of more rigorous criteria. \nAbrupt changes: In this exemplar case study, any change \nin value of scaled system measures following a period of \nconstant value over at least 80 seconds is defined as an abrupt \nchange. For now, only the first abrupt change is evaluated. \nLonger time series will be required for a study of abrupt ndownstream changes in future development of this technology. \nFor the small signal stability case 1 the first abrupt change in \nscaled system measures occurs at time 1 second which is when \nthere is a sudden change in load at bus 7 by +50 MW. For \nthe transient stability case 1, the abrupt change also happens \nat 1 second, the time that a fault occurs in the system. But \nthis result can only be considered indicative. More rigorous nanalysis of different scenarios and networks is required for \nfurther development. \nSignificant Subsequences In order to identify periods of \noscillation, a threshold is defined for scaled system measures \nbased on their histogram, and periods of oscillatory activity \nare identified as subsequences of contiguous time epochs with \nhigher than threshold scaled system measures. A histogram \nof scaled mean measures for the small signal stability case \n1 \(Fig. 6, Top Right 0.55. With this threshold, \ntwenty-one subsequences of contiguous epochs are identified \n\(Fig. 6, Bottom Right system. \nThe histogram for transient stability case 1 shows a similar \ndistribution with a threshold also at 0.55 \(Fig. 6, Top Left subsequences of near constant values \nwith slight oscillations. In this case 28 subsequences are \nselected of variable length. Subsequences selected for small \nsignal stability case 1 and for transient stability case are shown \nrespectively on the bottom left, and right, in Fig. 6. \nTransition in inter-power angle measures over selected \nsubsequences: Relational measures are next computed between \npower angles based on selected subsequences and examined \nfor transition. The long-term objective of this analysis is to \ndevelop a real-time monitoring system for power networks \nthat will make an assessment of current system health and its \nprognosis based on an analysis of current data in conjunction \nwith historical data streams. \n". \n------\n,! I \nFig. 7 First Four Subsequences Selected for Small Signal Stability Case I \nFor this analysis only the first four non-trivial subsequences \n\(of length greater than one subsequences identified for small signal stability \ncase 1. The first subsequence is short with three selected nepochs, beginning at time 1.05 seconds and ending at 1.067 \nseconds. The second selected subsequence is long with 100 \ntime epochs, beginning at 1.175 seconds and ending at 2.08 \nseconds. The third subsequence covers the period 2.1670-\n2.275 seconds over 14 time epochs. The fourth subsequence \nis relatively longer starting at 3.1170, and ending at 3.833 \nseconds after 87 time epochs. Fig. 8 gives the corresponding \ninter-power angle relational measures. Note that the measures \nare not symmetrical in this case; this is because one of the ndimensions of comparison of power angle measures obtained \nacross time. The first subsequence of relational measures \nindicates that G4- is coupled to G 1 + and G2+ while G3- and \nG4- are coupled as are G2+ and G3-. It can be thus inferred \nthat Gl and G2 are coupled in the positive direction, and in \nasynchrony with G3 and G4 which are coupled in the negative \ndirection. This conclusion also holds true with the second \nsubsequence excepting in this case there is strong evidence of \ncoupling between Gl and G2 in the positive direction while \nboth generators are coupled to G3 in the negative direction. \nThe overall inference is unchanged with G2 and G4 being \nalso in asynchrony. The fourth and second subsequence system \nmeasures are almost identical while the third subsequence is \nclearly a transition point. \nFig. 8. Inter-Generator System Measures for Selected Subsequences for \nSmall Signal Stability Case 1 \nFig. 9 shows the first four subsequences identified for \ntransient stability case 1. The first and fourth subsequences \nare each of about 100 epochs long, the second subsequence \nis 9 epochs and third subsequence is 5 epochs in length. The \nstarting points for these epochs are marked with dashed lines in \nFig. 9. Fig. 10 gives the transitional measures associated with \nthese subsequences. As is clear from both figures, selected \nsubsequences 4 and 1 are similar. In both cases there is strong \nevidence of coupling between power angles at Gl and G2 in \nthe positive direction. There is also evidence that power angles \nat G3 and G4 are coupled in the negative direction, and that the \npower angle at G3 \(in the negative direction in the positive direction 


Inter­\npower angle system measures associated with subsequences 2 \nand 3 suggest that these are periods of transition with evidence \nof coupling between power angles at Gland G4 in the negative \ndirection during subsequence 2 epochs, and coupling between \nthe power angles at G2 and G4 in the negative direction during nsubsequence 3 epochs. \n-r ?

order to assess the benefit of\nthe whole architecture. The relative importance or weights\nfor the value aggregation rules must be known beforehand\nand are an input to the model.\nCost model\nThe goal of the cost model is to provide an estimate of the\nlifecycle cost of an architecture \(i.e., a set of constellations\nand ground stations particular differ-\nentiating between different contract modalities, \(procurement\nvs hosted payloads vs 100 commercial cost, operations cost, and\nprogram overhead. Some of these are further divided into\nnon-recurring and recurring costs, as illustrated in Fig. 3.\nPayload CostPayload cost is only incurred when the con-\ntract modality is procurement or hosted payloads. If a 100%\ncommercial approach is taken, payload cost is set to zero,\nas it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by the\nprovider. Payload cost is the sum of a non-recurring cost\nand a recurring cost. When these values are not provided by\nFigure 3. Lifecycle cost breakdown\nthe user, they are estimated using CERs that utilize payload\nmass m and number of channels n as independent variables.\nThe CERs are taken from the USCM8 model [23] and are\nprovided below. All values are in FY2010$k.\nCpayl,NR = 339m+ 5127n \(6 7 cost\nof fabricating a qualification unit and Cpayl,R is the cost of\nfabricating the first flight unit. The standard error of the\nestimate \(SEE SEE of Equation 7 inside\nthe domain 38-928kg is 28%. All SEEs are corrected for the\nnumber of degrees of freedom. Total cost for development\nand fabrication of N identical payloads is thus given by:\nCpayl = Cpayl,NR N\nbCpayl,R \(8 is only incurred when the contract\nmodality is procurement. If a 100% commercial approach\nor hosted payloads approach are taken, bus cost is set to zero,\nas it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by the\nprovider. Bus cost is the sum of a non-recurring cost and a\nrecurring cost. When these values are not provided by the\n10\nuser, they are estimated using CERs that utilize subsystem\nmass as the independent variable. The CERs are taken from\nthe USCM8 model [23] and are provided below. All values\nare in FY2010$k.\nCbus,NR = 110.2mdry \(9 10 is the devel-\nopment cost including the cost of fabricating a qualification\nunit and Cpayl,R is the cost of fabricating the first flight\nunit. The standard error of the estimate \(SEE 114-5127kg is 47%. The SEE of Equation\n10 inside the domain 288-7398kg is 21%. Total cost for\ndevelopment and fabrication of N identical buses is computed\nas illustrated in Equation 8, with a learning factor of 95%.\nNote that the computation of bus cost depends on the dry\nmass of the spacecraft. This can be provided by the user,\nor it can be estimated by the spacecraft design module, which\nis described later in this section.\nLaunch CostLaunch cost is only incurred when the contract\nmodality is procurement. If a 100% commercial approach\nor hosted payloads approach are taken, launch cost is set to\nzero, as it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by\nthe provider. Launch cost is given by the sum of the costs of\nlaunching all constellations in the architecture. Computation\nof launch cost for a constellation is based on the assumption\nthat, given a constellation of P planes and S satellites per\nplane, P < NL < PS launches are necessary to launch\nthe constellation, i.e., at least one launch per plane \(in\nother words, satellite engines are not sized to do inclination\nchanges after injection by taking into account both\nperformance and geometrical considerations.\nIn particular, a database of launchers is available to each\nconstellation. This database is shown in Table 5. Note that\nthe data concerning performance is provided in terms of the\n3 coefficients of a quadratic function of the orbit altitude.\nIn other words, if the entry of the table for a certain orbit\ntype \(e.g., LEO polar  then the\nperformance at altitude h can be computed as :\nperf\(h 11 computed as follows:\nNL = max{NL,mass, NL,vol, NL,dim} \(12 required\ngiven the total spacecraft mass and the performance of the\nlaunch vehicle to the desired orbit NL,vol is the minimum\nnumber of launches required given the total spacecraft vol-\nume and the volume of the launch vehicle; NL,dim is the\nminimum number of launches required given the sum of the\nmaximum dimension of all spacecraft and the height of the\nlaunch vehicle:\nNL,mass = d\n?NS/C\ni=1 mwet,i\nperf\(lv, orbit 13 14 15 spacecraft in the constella-\ntion, mwet,i, voli, and dmaxi are the wet mass, volume,\nand maximum dimension respectively of spacecraft i, and\nperf\(lv, orbit the volume, and the height respectively of\nthe launch vehicle. Once the number of launches has been\ncomputed launch cost is simply given by the product of\nnumber of launches and launch cost.\nGround segment costGround segment cost is the sum of a\nnon-recurring cost and a recurring cost. When these values\nare not provided by 


the user, they are estimated using CERs\nthat utilize location of the facility, the number of spacecraft,\nand spacecraft lifetime as independent variables. The CERs\nare taken from [23] and are provided below. All values are in\nFY2010$k.\nCground,R = Cground,NR + Cground,Rt\(yr loc n$\nm2\n m2 0.5\n$M\nS/C/yr\nNS/Ct\(yr 16 loc construction cost in different locations, A is\nthe floor area of the facility in m2, and t\(yr lifetime\nin years. The values of the adjustment factor are taken from\n[23].\nService fees Service fees are only applicable for hosted\npayloads and 100% commercial approaches. In these cases,\nthey can replace payload bus, launch, or ground segment\ncost. Service fees for the hosted payloads approach are\ncomputed as a fix quantity \(10$M resources such as volume, mass, power, data rate, or a\ncombination thereof. Service fees for the 100 commercial\napproach are computed as a fixed quantity \($2k spacecraft design module can be by-\npassed by choosing to assign a commercially available bus\ninstead of designing a bus. While the standard bus approach is\ncloser to reality, the spacecraft design module provides more\ndistinction in lifecycle cost between different architectures,\nand therefore it is chosen as the primary operating mode of\nthe tool. The spacecraft design module is an iterative module\nthat provides a subsystem-level design of the spacecraft bus\nincluding a very rough configuration of the spacecraft from\nthe payload requirements.Assumptions concerning the differ-\nent sub-modules in the spacecraft design module namely the\nbus selection module and the four steps of the process shown\n11\nTable 5.

The values shown in Table 6 were taken\nfrom 25]:\nThe ?VADCS required for ADCS depends on the ADCS\nconfiguration, as shown in Table 7. These values were\nadapted from [25].\nThe ?Vdeorbit is computed assuming that LEO spacecraft are\ndeorbited using atmospheric drag, and all other spacecraft\nare deorbited using solar radiation presure. For drag-based\ndeorbiting 


the?Vdeorbit is computed based on a change of\nsemimajor axis from the current circular orbit to an elliptical\norbit that has the perigee at 0km and the apogee at the orbit\naltitude:\n?Vdeorbit,drag = ?V \(r, r RE , r, r 23 semimajor axis from the\ncurrent circular orbit to an elliptical orbit that has the same\nperigee and a slightly higher apogee:\n?Vdeorbit,SRP = ?V \(r, r, r, r + ?h, r 24 are due to the GEO restricted zone, the\n35km are to allow for gravitational perturbations, and the\nremaining margin depends on the magnitude of the effect of\nsolar radiation pressure on the spacecraft \(the larger the ef-\nfect, the larger the margin the spacecraft.\nOnce the ?V has been calculated, it is possible to compute\nthe propellant mass required to satisfy this ?V budget. The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntemThe mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators. The mass\nof the sensors is driven by the attitude knowledge accuracy\nrequirement acc \(Equation 26 satisfy by the momentum storage h required \(Equation 27 26 27 that acc can vary depending on the architecture, as the\npointing requirements of a high gain antenna, or an optical\npayload, are very different from those of a low gain antenna.\nConcerning the momentum storage h, it is assumed to be\nsized to counter the different disturbance torques produced by\natmospheric drag, gravity gradient, solar radiation pressure,\nor the Earths magnetic field. Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystemsThe thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload. The\nconstans k that are used for each subsystem are summarized\nin Table 8.\nThe mass of the launch adapter mLA = 0.01mdry is added\nto the mass of the spacecraft.\nUpdate spacecraft mass and dimensionsAfter the first iter-\nation, the dry and wet mass of the spacecraft are updated.\nDimensions are estimated assuming a perfect cube of 100\nkg/m3. The mass and dimensions of the solar panels are\ntaken into account to update the inertial properties of the\nspacecraft, as illustrated in Equation 30:\nLA = 1.5s+ 0.5\n?\nAa\n2\nIz = 0.01mdry\nIx = Iy = Iz + L\n2\naMa \(30 design algorithm is\niterative because several feedback loops appear in the N2\nmatrix showing the dependences between different modules\nin the algorithm. For instance, the mass of the ADCS depends\non the mass of the spacecraft, which obviously depends on the\nmass of the ADCS. Thus, a set of convergence criteria need\nto be defined. The convergence criteria used by the tool are\ndescribed in Equation 31:\n|mdry,i+1 ?mdry,i| < 10kg 31 the current status of the MIT archi-\ntecture study for the SCaN system. The study consists of a\nstakeholder analysis to identify the primary stakeholders and\ntheir needs, and the development of a computational tool to\nexplore the architectural tradespace.\nSeveral interviews have been conducted with experts at\nNASA to elicit the potential requirements on SCaN from\ndifferent user communities.\nThe major architectural decisions to be made by the SCaN\nprogram have been identified and encoded in a mathematical\nmodel. A computational tool has been developed that can\nautomatically enumerate and evaluate thousands of different\nSCaN architectures. This tool contains both a performance\nand a cost model.\nNext Steps\nThe next steps include calibration of the optical link budget\ncalculations, comparisons of the network scheduling calcula-\ntions with historical TDRSS load data, and validation of the\nspacecraft sizing algorithm with real TDRS data. Following\nthe completion of the stakeholder analysis, the tool will be\nbe used to explore the architectural tradespace and identify\na subset of preferred architectures worth studying in more\ndetail. These architectures could then be analyzed in NASAs\nArchitecture Development Lab \(ADL NNX11AR70G.\nThe authors would also like to thank the Centre de Formacio\nInterdisciplina`ria Superior and the Cellex Foundation for\npartially funding this project.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
