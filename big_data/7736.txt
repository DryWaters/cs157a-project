Tianjin Key Lab for Advanced Signal Processing, Civil Aviation Univ of China. Tianjin 300300, China Abstract Automatic target recognition technique, based on the projections in the samples range space, can be availably used in SAR target recognition It requires that the relativity between the range spaces of different targets should be minimal. However, the relativity between the corresponding range spaces is very big if the different targets have similar appearance and structure, which 
will considerably reduce the recognition performance. So, it is essential to construct new projection spaces from the range spaces of similar targets, so as to enlarge projection difference. In this paper, an efficient method for constructing the optimal projection space is proposed. The proposed method can effectively enlarge the difference between similar targets by the projections in the optimal projection space. Experimental results show that the optimal projection space can greatly increase th e separability between different similar targets and is superior to other classical methods in both reco gnition performance and efficiency Keywords Automatic Target Recognition; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Projection Space 1. Introduction For its all-weather, all-time working capability and high 
resolution, synthetic aperture radar \(SAR\has been widely used in military reconnaissan ce, as well as civilian remote sensing of the Earth and many other areas of exploration SAR-based automatic targ et recognition \(ATR important technology to improve the utilization of SAR image Its particular application in battlefield sensing has become a hot research  SAR-based ATR technology is mainly divided into template matching method s and model reconstruction methods  4   5   I n tem p late m a tching m e thods standa rd templates are formed based on the training samples, and used to classify the test ones.

However, if the relation ship of the range subspaces is large, the perfo rmance of recognition will be poor In this paper, an effective method of projection space construction  is  proposed  for the  classification  of  different targets with similar range spaces. With the reasonable constructed projection space, the distinction between different targets is increased, which is h elpful to the classification and recognition. The experimental results show that this method has good performance on the recognition with small number 
of training samples and mu lti-type of similar targets 2. Problem Formulation Considering K types of SAR targets, the number of training samples of k th target is k N 1,2 kK  Each SAR image of the k th target is expanded to column vector 1,2 i kk iN  s and matrix 12   k N 
kkk k  Sss s  is formed Usually, the pixel number M of SAR images is much larger than the number k N of SAR training images. So, the rank of k S meets  kk rank N M  S   The eigenvalue decomposition is done to the covariance matrix of k S and the k th target’ s range space  k 
S is constructed with non-zero ei genvalue eigenvect  If there is little or no relativity between different targets’ range space, the samples projection in the range space can be directly used as their features for the classification and recognition However, there is often strong similarity in the appearance and structure of the targets. Their range spaces are not orthogonal, even have stro ng relativity. So, th e difference of different target’s projection in range space is weaken which will make it difficult for target recognition. Therefore it is necessary to transform the range spaces of similar targets to new projection spaces, so as to enlarge projection difference The optimal projection space  opt k P of the 
k th target should meet 1\ost similar with k th range space 2\rictly orthogonal with other range space This paper is to construct the optimal projection space  opt k P from strong correlative range spaces of different targets With projection in  opt k P the projection-value of k th target will be maximized, while other targets be minimized _______________ ______________ 978-1-4244-2732-1/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE 


3. Projection Space Construction Define  k G as the range space of all the targets except for the k th one, thus 12 1 1          kkkK   GSS SS S  1 According to the conditions to be met for the optimal projection spaces, th e solution of  opt k P can be expressed as follow     min   k HH kk kk F st  P SP I GP O 2 where F  stands for the Frobenius no rm of a matrix, and the column of the matrix is p N p k N N   I is a matrix with dimension kp N N  with the main diagonal elements being ones and others zeros Considering the whole range space  S of all the targets 12      K  SSS S  3 The rank of space  S still meets  rank N M  S  where 1 K N NN   the column number of matrix  S Obviously  S is a subspace of Euclid space  M R  According to equation \(1  k G is a subspace of  S  Let   kk   PG S  subspace  k P is orthogonal with  k G and   kk  PG S  4 According to matrix theory  k P is composed by the eigenvectors corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix 11           H HHH kkk k   SS S S G G G G 5 However, because  S is a subspace of Euclid space  M R  the computing complexity of direct eigen-decomposition method is about 4  OM which will fairly lower the processing efficiency. So, in this paper, a fast algorithm based on orthogonal complement space is proposed According to equation \(4  S and    kk GP stand for a same space, so there must be a unitary matrix N s  QR meeting    kk  SQ G P 6 Let 12  s  QQQ in which 1 Q and 2 Q are orthogonal complement space to each other, meeting 1  k  GSQ 7 2   k  PSQ 8 According to equation \(7 1 1     HH k   QSSSG 9 For 1 Q and 2 Q are orthogonal complement space to each other, thus 22 11 H H  QQ I QQ 10 Therefore 2 Q is composed of the eigenvectors corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues of 11 H  IQQ So incorporating 2 Q into equation \(8\can get  k P  Assume p Q is a unitary matrix and 1  kkp  PPQ thus 11      H HH kk kp kp kk  PP PQ PQ PP 11 So 1  k P and  k P stands for a sam o nsidering 1    HH kk k k p  GP G PQ O 12 1  k P also meets constraints of equa tion \(2\So, th e matrix form of  k G s orthogonal subspace is not unique.

Experimental Results In this paper, the SAR image database of U.S. MSTAR plan is employed. Three main types of the targets, BMP, BTR T72 with full-orientation SAR image data, are selected for the research. The data collected on the perspective 17  and 15  are respectively used as training samples and test ones. All the images are in 128 128  pixel size First, with MSTAR data, we study on the separability of projection data, which is gene rated by the proposed method In the range of 60  window, the range space  B MP S   B TR S  72  T S are calculated, and the optimal projection space  opt B MP P   opt B TR P  72  opt T P are constructed. The trai ning and testing samples of BMP and BTR are separately projected to  B MP S The results are shown in Fig 2. Where, horizontal axis stands for the eigenvectors of projection space, sorted by corresponding eigenvalues; vertical axis stands for samples’ projection length on each eigenvector of projection space Comparing each sub-figure in Fig 2, we can find that the projection of BMP and BTR are difficult to distinguish Correspondingly, the same data are projected to  opt B MP P shown 


in Fig 3. We can find that there is prodigious difference between the projection of BMP and BTR. Therefore, the projection space constructed in this paper can greatly enlarge the distinction of different targets  10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection  10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection a\                                                               \(b\amples    10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection  10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection c\ Training Samples                                                                 \(d\ Test Samples Fig 2 Projection of BMP and BTR Samples in BMP’s Range Space  B MP S 10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection  10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection a\P Training Samples                                                               \(b 10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection  10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection c\ BTR Training Samples                                                               \(d Testing Samples Fig 3 Projection of BMP and BTR Samples in BMP’s Optimal Projection Space  opt B MP P Then, we study the influence of different-size orientation window on the recognition performance. For each orientation division with width 30   60   90   180  and 360  the optimal projection space is constructed with training samples in current window. Projection matrix  L k P  1  kK  is composed with the first 5 L vector of the optimal projection space  k P Thus, the simplest classifier is defined: sample l x is classified to the type of the pr ojection matrix in which it has the largest projection norm The projection norm of sample l x in matrix  L k P is defined as   1,2 HL lk l k px k K  P 16 Based on the above method, the recognition rate of the three main types is shown in Fig 4. We can find that, this method has good recognition performance for all the three targets, especially for BTR and T72 being better than 95 Further, the recognition pe rformance of the proposed method is compared with other outstanding algorithms. With the same experimental conditions, the recognition performance of four methods in different orientation window is plotted in Fig 5. We can find that, this method is superior to 


other recognition methods in the overall performance Although it has a slight decrease for the window width 360   it’s still equal to KPCA+SVM method  30 60 90 180 360 80 85 90 95 100            Recognition Rate BMP   BTR   T72   Average Fig 4 Recognition Performance in Different Window Width 30 60 90 180 360 80 85 90 95 100               Recognition Rate SVM   PCA+SVM   KPCA+SVM   Proposed Fig 5 Performance Comparison of Different Recognition Methods Finally, this method is comp ared with other algorithms on the training and recognition efficiency, which is defined as the processed sample number per second. The efficiency comparison between the above four methods is shown in Fig 6. We can find that, the proposed method is 20% more than the best SVM method in trai ning efficiency, and 50% in recognition efficiency. Therefore the proposed method is far superior to other recognition methods in processing efficiency  Fig 6 Efficiency Comparison of Different Recognition Methods 5. Conclusions In this paper, a SAR-based ATR method of projection space construction is proposed. Keeping the strict orthogonal with other types of space, the con structed optimal projection space can get the largest approaching with target space. The space similarity between different targets is greatly eliminated Therefore, this method is more applicable to recognize the targets with similar pattern and structure. The experimental results show that this method is superior to other recognition methods in both recognition performance and processing efficiency 6 Acknowledgements This work is su pported in part by National Natural Science Foundations of China under grant 607 36009 and 60872110 References  Duan Rong , Chen Ling , M a n Hong . “Adaptive SAR ATR in  likelihood space”.

members without regard to what they receive, others with high EI may be more sensitive to the outcomes Despite the different findings in the context of union su ppos ed th at EI h a s a pos iti v e  moderating effect on the perceived benefit KS relationship in the GVT. EI is a dispositional orientation, referring to the favor of the trade of work effort for material and symbolic benefits a dd  and Henry e EI as h a v i ng a m oderating effect on the relationship between perceived organizational support and organizational citizenship behavior \(POS-OCB\. This finding helps us to examine the EI influences on the sharing behavior among team members. For example, given that a team expects economic or social benefits to affect KS among team members, individuals with high EI will be very concerned about these benefits, and therefore share knowledge beyond the group s normal expectations while individuals with low EI are less concerned about the benefits of sharing knowledge, and may further dampen the effects of benefits. Considering that the perception of extrinsic reward, reciprocity and image has similar influences on the KS, we propose hypotheses 2a, 2b and 2c as H2a \(EI moderate Reward-KS The relationship between reward and KS behavior will be more strongly positive with strong EI H2b \(EI moderate Reciprocity-KS The relationship between reciprocity and KS behavior will be more strongly positive with strong EI H2c \(EI moderate Image-KS The relationship between image and KS behavior will be more strongly positive with strong EI  4. Research Methodology 4.1. Operationalization of Constructs  A cross-sectional survey instrument was designed to get information about all of the variables. We adapted existing scales to enhance validity. Some questions were modified to match the background of this study All the constructs were measured through seven-point scales anchored from strongly disagree to strongly agree or never to very frequently A summary of constructs and items is listed in Table 1  4.2. Survey Administration  The field study was conducted in a global virtual project program among universities which conducted by City University of Hong Kong, called BOHKNet www.BOHKNet.com\. The period of data collection is over 3 months, from September to December in 2006. The goal of BOHKNet project is letting students actually work together in a virtual team for problembased collaborative learning. BOHKNet include several university from different countries, such as Beijing University of Technology \(China\, City University of Hong Kong \(Hong Kong\, Eindhoven Univesity of Technology \(Netherland\ and Tilburg University \(Netherland Several part-time postgraduate students in four universities with different background \(e.g. business and engineering\ applied to join in the teams of BOHKNet and work together for solving different research questions. The BOHKNet team consists of 10 to 12 students in 3 locations. Each team was assigned a software-related topic \(e.g policy programs for eservice rom different geographical perspectives. All the teams should discuss their topics from a European and Asian perspective, write the report in an integrated framework rather than simply connect different parts within the timeframe of 8 weeks. Members can upload and download documents, posted progress reports through electronic blackboard developed by City University of Hong Kong. BOHKNet also encourages members to communicate with each other in direct ways, such as using instant messengers \(e.g. MSN\ and VoIP technology \(e.g. Skype\. An incentive scheme for encouraging knowledge sharing was also introduced Team members can receive points and gifts based on the evaluation of their team performance on knowledge sharing process. For example, each team was encouraged to upload logs of their on-line meetings to the electronic blackboard. Teams contribution was monitored and instructor conferences were held weekly to provide consistent team feedback. In the end of project, instructors would reward 3 teams based on their performance on knowledge sharing 13 virtual project teams were willing to participate in the survey.

Data Analysis and Result 5.1. Measurement Analysis  The descriptive statistics of the variables in this study is presented in Table 1. The adapted existing scales ensure the content validity of constructs. We assessed reliabilities of all constructs by calculating Cronbach s alpha \(See Table 2\ All the Cronbach s alpha values were found to be greater than 0.7 The items were tested for validity using factor analysis with principle components analysis and varimax rotation \(See Table 3\. Convergent validity was assessed by checking loadings to see if items within the same construct correlated highly amongst themselves. Discriminant validity was assessed by examining the factor loadings to see if questions loaded more highly on their intended constructs than on other constructs a bach n i c k a n d F i del l 47 suggested that loadings should be at least 0.32, and loadings from 0.45 to 0.54 are considered fair, 0.55 to 0.62 are considered good, 0.63 to 0.70 are considered very good and above 0.71 are considered excellent Factor analysis yielded 5 components with eigenvalues above 1. These 5 components corresponded to the 5 constructs. One question for exchange ideology EI4\apped onto other constructs and was omitted. After omitting EI4, the reliability of the exchange ideology construct improved to 0.75 Table 3.

6. Discussion  Based on our findings, image did not significantly affect individual KS behavior. This may be due to the fact that the research project of surveying the virtual teams in this study was short-term. In a virtual team when members work on a short-term project, they might not have enough time to gather sufficient information about their co-workers to establish mutual trus h ere is an in terac tion eff ect o f i m ag e a n d  mutual trust in the social exchange relationshi the teams without mutual trust, high perception of image might not enhance individual KS behavior. In BOHKNet, each project lasted about 8 to 10 weeks Before the project, members of the virtual teams did not know each other; after the project, they might not meet each other again. Under such circumstances, if members share critical knowledge, they may be appraised. However, it requires a long time to establish mutual trust. In virtual teams with a timeframe of 8 weeks, the interaction time may be too short for establishing considerable mutual trust among members Moreover, the technology-based communication in virtual teams replaces the face-to-face communication in organizations which leads to a lack of mutual trust among team members and reduces the positive influence of image on peoples willingness to share knowledge [39, 40   One of the most interesting findings is about the negative moderating effects of EI. Many researchers have emphasized the positive moderating effects of EI in the relationships of perceived benefits and social exchange behavior, such as KS and organizational citizen behavior. From the perspective of social exchange theory, an individual with strong EI is more responsive to the perceived benefits, thus enhances the reciprocal effort \(e.g., sharing knowledge\or receiving benefits. However, contrary to the hypotheses, this study shows that EI negatively moderates the relationship between perceived benefits and KS in the GVTs. That is, members with strong EI show little or no KS behavior as the response to the economic or social benefits. A reasonable explanation for this negative moderating effect can be found in research on exchange natures of social exchange [41  R e dm a n et al. \(20 05 s u gg es t t h at th e eff ect s of EI vary according to the specific nature of the exchange in different types of organizations. In this study, the novel findings may be due to the characteristics of virtual teams in the BOHKNet The negative effects of EI can further be explained in two ways. First, the short-term exchange nature of virtual teams leads to members showing little response to longer-term benefits of reciprocity. EI is concerned with the extent to which individuals believe that their own reciprocating behavior \(e.g., knowledge sharing should be a function of the benefit they receive from the social exchange  in div i d u al w i th  s t rong EI  will calculate whole benefits from social exchange, and choose to share or withdraw other knowledg However, the factor of the timeframe should be considered in calculating the benefits of exchange. In social exchange, the benefits include not only the benefits of the current exchanges, but also some additional benefits of future exchange  Rational  individuals will compare the net benefits of all future exchanges with the cost. They may be willing to accept a less-than-hoped-for outcome in the short term because they believe that they will receive their desired outcomes over time. Thus, an individual with strong EI may show more work effort than the organization expected. In this condition, EI may have a positive influence on the relationship between social benefits and KS. However, in short-term teams, members will focus on the benefits from current exchange [17, 42 43 In th is st u d y  all v i rt u a l tea m s d i d s h o r tter m  projects in only 8 weeks. In contrast to a long term reciprocal relationship in the organization, members in BOHKNet could help others and receive help from others during the limited time of two months. Although members may perceive high levels of short-term reciprocity in the project rational individuals may also be concerned with the lack of future and additional benefits from longer-term exchanges. Based on the cost-benefit calculation, they will show a lower level of KS than the response to the benefits. In contrast individuals with weak EI have general expectations on the benefits. They will share the knowledge as a normal benefit of reciprocity. Thus, in this circumstance, EI has negative moderating effects Second, due to some other characteristics of BOHKNet teams \(e.g., group size, task nature and leadership\dividuals with strong EI may show a higher free-riding tendency to minimize effort on knowledge for a high benefit of reward, while individuals with weak EI may show a normal response to the incentives. Different from the long-term relationship in social exchange, economic exchange has been seen as the one-off exchange without a timeframe. However, our findings suggest that EI buffers the positive relationships between reward and KS in the virtual context. That is, individuals with strong EI may show little or no effort on sharing knowledge even when they perceive incentives, while individuals with weak EI may show a positive response to incentives. This requires further explanation. A possible explanation for this negative effect is found in the free-riding theory. In this theory, the basic freerider problem is that the individual will fail to participate in collectively profitable activities in the absence of coercion or individually appropriable Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


inducements  e d on th is t h eor y a ration a l  actor will have a free-riding tendency to gain outcomes of collective incentives with little or no effort on KS The free-riding tendency is related to several characteristics of work group, such as 1\roup size and 2\h e ch aracteris tic s of virtu a l  teams in BOHKNet may have led to the free-riding tendency of individuals with strong EI. A group member s decision to free ride results from a comparison of the net expected benefits of contributing to the group s common interest and the net expected benefits of free riding S o m e f actors accoun t f o r  the influence of group size on free riding: e.g noticeability. Previous studies have found that individuals in larger groups contribute less knowledge than those in small groups In  B OHKNet, th e  reward to encourage KS was team-based with each virtual team having 10 to 12 members; this is larger than most studies with work groups of no more than 8 people [19, 26, 38 More ov er, m o s t virtu a l tea m s i n  BOHKNet adopted video conferencing and instant messenger \(e.g., MSN\ for synchronous interaction and KS. These collaborative technologies support low additive capabilities \(e.g., tr acking\ where GVTs can track and notice if a member contributes knowledge to the whole team T h ere f ore, in th es e larg e an d  distributed teams, team members may not notice if a member contributes knowledge to the whole work Thus, individuals with strong EI may be prone to gaining benefits with sharing little or no knowledge One way to assure the provision of public goods is management control [3  A  gr o u p  m a na ge r c a n r e vi e w  the process of KS, give feedback to each member and distribute outcomes to individuals based on the evaluation of effort on sharing knowledge. Many studies indicate the importance of the role of a leader in virtual teams B O H KNet, v i rtu a l tea m s  w e re  not required to assign a leader in each team. Thus members with strong EI may free ride with lower effort for the same benefits with others  7. Implications and Limitations 7.1 Implications for Theory  This study contributes to the KS literature in two ways. First, it provides a more complete understanding of KS relationship in GVTs from the perspective of benefits. It also demonstrates that several economic and social benefits \(extrinsic reward, reciprocity\n influence the KS behavior in the context of virtual teams. Apart from identifying benefits influencing KS in virtual teams, this study fails to confirm that personal image appears to impact KS in short-term GVTs. Personal image is thought to be the motivator in encouraging KS. However, in our study, this is not a significant concern for members to share knowledge Future research should investigate further how perceived image influences KS dynamics in GVTs Second, this study shows that the impact of benefits on KS in GVTs appears to be moderated by individual differences \(i.e., exchange ideology\urther, this explorative study suggests that the effects of EI on KS may be different in different contexts. For example, the results of the study suggest that EI may have negative moderating effects on the relationship between reciprocity and KS in virtual teams with short-term projects. These results are contrary to hypotheses developed from social exchange theory in organizations with longer-term relationship. More research is needed to verify this  7.2 Implications for Practice  The findings of this study offer virtual teams some guidelines on how to promote KS in the virtual context. As significant findings for influences of some benefits on KS, several strategies could be considered First, an incentive scheme should be introduced to encourage individuals to share knowledge with the rules about different strokes for different folks A portfolio of incentives could be provided to different individuals for everyone favouring the outcomes of their sharing effort. Second, managers of virtual teams can raise the perceptions of the reciprocity benefit among team members by highlighting regular and frequent meetings for exchanging ideas and discussing new team-created solutions Further, the finding that strong EI as a moderator tends to block or suppress economic and social benefits is especially interesting as virtual teams consider strategies to encourage KS. Some functions, such as supporting user identity and sending notices of contributions should be applied in the formal KS process for helping to track whether a member contributes knowledge to the whole work or not. It is also surmised that the moderating effect of reciprocity is negative due to the short-term project. Management of virtual teams should encourage members to establish longer social relationships through informal ways, such as communicating and adding friends through software, such as instant messenger \(e.g., MSN and ICQ\d VoIP technology \(e.g., Skype\everal strategies could be considered to avoid the free-riding behavior in virtual teams: 1\ limiting the group size so that each member s work effort is noticeable; 2 emphasizing the role of the leader for evaluating each member s work effort and distributing team-created outcomes to members  7.3 Limitations and Future Studies  Our findings must be interpreted in light of the limitations of the studies. First, common method Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


variance may bias our findings to some degree However, findings concerning the direction of interaction effects may be less susceptible to common method bias than are those concerning the significance of main effects. Second, this study was based on a sample of 113 respondents, and although several significant results were obtained, a larger sample bringing more statistical power would have allowed more sophisticated statistical analysis. Third, this study collected data in a short-term virtual project in the universities. These samples may reduce the generalization of this study. Future studies should investigate virtual teams in the wider field \(e.g. longterm projects, and different tasks\, and compare results between short-term and long-term projects with more different tasks Future research could extend our study to account for the remaining inadequately explained effects of EI in several ways. First, future research might usefully examine the effect of EI in different contexts, including collocated projects and virt ual communities. Second followed with some additional research perspective such as free-riding theory, future studies could examine other unexplained variance in the relationship between perceptions of benefits and KS  8. Conclusion In GVTs, KS has been seen as the social exchange process whereby individual members share knowledge for material and symbolic benefits. Further, the individual differences whether members favour benefits obtained from KS or not, should be an important indicator in knowledge management practices in GVTs. In this study, we examined the individual EI as a moderator of the KS relationships Surprisingly, we found that people who favour the benefits strongly may withdraw knowledge. This finding is consistent with some studies showing a negative reaction to incentives from the perspective of free-riding behaviour. A possible explanation may be in the short term project and large group sizes in the teams that we surveyed. In these contexts rational  people may free ride with low opportunity cost. We believe that this finding contributes to theory by showing that individual differences may have a different influence on KS in different working contexts. In practice, we suggest that the management of virtual teams should be careful with incentives. This study poses interesting research questions for future investigation  References 1  M Al a v i a nd D E Lei dner   K nowl e dge Ma na ge ment  Systems: Issues, Challenges and Benefits Communications of AIS vol. 2, pp. 1-37, 1999 2  M Al a v i a nd A Ti wa na   K nowl e d g e I n t e gr a t i on i n Vi r t ua l Teams Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology vol. 53, pp. 1029-1037, 2002 3  R Al b a nes e a nd D D V Fl eet   R a t i ona l  B e ha v i or i n  Groups: The Free-Riding Tendency Academy of Mangement Review vol. 10, pp. 244-255, 1985 4 A  A r d ich v ili, V  P a g e an d T  We n tlin g  M o tiv atio n an d  Barriers to Participation in Virtual Knowledge Sharing Communities of Practice Journal of Knowledge Management vol. 7, pp. 64-77, 2003 5  S Ba J Sta l la er t  a nd A.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
