Service quality s impact on mobile satisfaction and intention to use 3G service  Yung-Ming Li National Chiao-Tung University yml@mail.nctu.edu.tw Yung-Shao Yeh National Chiao-Tung University dyyeh67@gmail.com   Abstract  Third generation of mobile technology \(3G\, being an instantaneous communication medium, is related to mobile commerce \(MC\ and this has grown rapidly and spread around the globe. IT researchers often place their focus on users acceptance and its 
antecedents. Yet factors that influence satisfaction in MC are rarely seen. Viewing 3G service as a mobile technology, this paper has applied technology acceptance model \(TAM\, coupled with other service quality factors in relation to 3G service from literature that play roles in influencing user s satisfaction, to empirically test users perceptions on using 3G service The proposed model was evaluated by using data collected from an online survey of 212 3G users. While the tests of internal consistency and validity indicate all scales being reliable and valid, results reveal that users behavioral intention to use 3G service is 
influenced by satisfaction and trust. Yet customization usefulness and ease-of-use were shown to have significant explanatory power in predicting users  satisfaction. This study offers a unique contribution to the mobile communication research by providing empirical evidence of users perception of service quality  1. Introduction  Second generation \(2G\ers to a cell-phone network and is a wireless mobile technology that is digital instead of analog \(1G\like 2G that can only transfer textual data and voice with limited bandwidth third generation \(3G\mobile technology provides a 
much faster speed for on-line and real-time information data transfer regardless of time and place. Users with 3G technology-embedded phone can send an electronic greeting card with images, have a live video communication connected from two places apart with their relatives, and stay active in on-line commerce activities with their phones. While these services are regarded as 3G service, this interactive feature may be one of the most appealing functions to mobile phone users and also creates a profit opportunity for mobile network operators. Researchers often refer this type of commerce as mobile commerce \(MC\ [32, 33, 59  
According to a Taiwan Economic News report in June 2003 55 the number of mobile phone subscribers in Taiwan had a penetration rate of 102.5%. Taking this phenomenon as an advantage, mobile network operators are putting effort into encouraging their customers to use 3G service. For mobile network operators, customer relationship management \(CRM is an important issue. What makes CRM difficult are that users are neither satisfied with 3G service nor aware of the utilities that can be gained by using 3G service. According to Lee and Benbasat 32 poor service quality can be one of the reasons contributing 
to the growth slower than predicted. Profitability for mobile network operators lies with the number of users. To maintain the users satisfaction is to provide the satisfactory service quality. Strategies must be based on 3G users behavior pattern and thus develop a profit-generating model accordingly Many researchers have widely explored the research topics in mobile commerce context 21, 22, 31, 33, 36   They tried to validate the antecedents that affect the users adoption of 3G service and to determine the 
loyalty and trust s formation process towards mobile commerce context. However, little attention has been put on what aspects could be utilized to comfort 3G users, to improve 3G users satisfaction, and, in turn, to influence their behavioral intention to use 3G service It seems intuitively logical that there should be a causal link between service quality, satisfaction, trust, and behavioral intention in 3G context. Thus, it becomes our primary concern to investigate service quality that plays a role in affecting 3G users satisfaction. We 
believe that with an increased customer satisfaction the behavioral intention to use 3G service as well as the trust towards using 3G service will also increase  2. Conceptual background &hypotheses development  The following literature review in the context of mobile commerce is to ensure that comprehensive measures are included. Relevant constructs and related measures in literature are identified and discussed followed by the proposed hypotheses Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


To examine the customers satisfaction in MC context, an exploratory study is conducted that involves five antecedents of satisfaction: interactivity customization, responsiveness, usefulness and ease-ofuse. These constructs will be individually discussed Behavioral intention to use 3G service in this framework is recognized as repeated use after the initial use. To understand how future repeated use of 3G service is influenced, we also discuss the roles of trust combined with satisfaction. Among these constructs, antecedents of satisfactions affects behavioral intention to use 3G service directly after the initial use, while trust affects behavioral intention in the absence of direct experience. Essentially, trusting belief can be enhanced from other users experience Interactivity has many definitions; depending on how it is looked and in what context it is measured Rice 49 defined interactivity as the information exchange behavior enabled by the computer-embedded communication system. McMillan and Hwang 38  categorized interactivity on features, process, or perception. To measure interactivity in online environment, Ha and James  suggested interactivity in the fulfillment of communication needs and should be 5-dimensional: playfulness, choice, connectedness information collection and reciprocal communication In mobile commerce environment, Lee 33 defined mobile interactivity as continuance of mobile commerce activities irrespective of users time and location and conceptualized mobile interactivity as 6 dimensional: user control, responsiveness personalization, connectedness, ubiquitous connectivity and contextual offer. Based on these review of literature, interactivity, which can be perceived as a quality dimension 62 will be primarily focused on ubiquitous connectivity and textual offer in this study because they fulfill the characteristics of mobile service. In the marketing field, the improved service quality positively influences the level of satisfaction 9  Thus, it is hypothesized that  H1. Interactivity directly and positively affects the satisfaction of using 3G service   Customization refers to tailoring ability enhanced by users mobile setting 32 and can be used to enhance the mobile interface design and to improve mobile usability 61   In e-commerce context, customization means to satisfy customers need and results in customer satisfaction. Thus, in a MC context, the existing evidence suggests that customization is associated with improvement of service quality. Thus it is hypothesized that  H2. Customization directly and positively affects the satisfaction of using 3G service   Responsiveness in the e-commerce context relates to speedy feedback 7 responsiveness to the user   and immediacy of feedback 30  In IS field responsiveness is one of dimensions in SERVQUAL proposed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry 43, 44 45   Based on Jiang, Klein and Crampton 24   SERVQUAL has drawn the attention from researchers and market practitioners not only as a measure but also as a diagnostic tool for uncovering uncovering areas of service quality strengths and shortfalls 26, 27, 28, 46, 58 59   Accordingly, responsiveness in this study refers to the willingness or readiness of employees to help customers and provide prompt service. Precisely, it is the response probability and speed. In general, the researchers above treat responsiveness in relation to service quality. In the marketing literature, service quality is long known as an antecedent of customer satisfaction 4   Thus, it is expected that  H3. Responsiveness directly and positively affects the satisfaction of using 3G service   Usefulness and ease-of-use are the two vital elements in technology acceptance model \(TAM 6   In TAM, behavioral intention to use is jointly influenced by attitude and usefulness, where the latter affects the former directly. Moreover, ease-of-use directly influences usefulness and attitude. In general TAM functions to explain and predict individual acceptance of IT According to Davis 6 these two factors influence the individual attitude towards using the system. It is closely related to the acceptance of computer technologies 6, 60  and is of great importance for new users 13   In the mobile service quality context, to measure the service quality, usefulness and ease-of-use are modified to include aspects such as effectiveness and immediateness of purpose fulfillment, skill of using 3G service and degree of easiness of utilizing 3G service. Based on the review of empirical evidence usefulness and ease-of-use can elicit positive impact on satisfaction   As customers encounter a welldesigned interface, the reduced effort will result in a higher satisfaction of using such service. Thus, it can be expected that  H4. Usefulness directly and positively affects the satisfaction of using 3G service H5.

H6. Ease-of-use directly and positively affects the usefulness  Variables of interactivity, customization responsiveness, usefulness and ease-of-use all together are treated as factors of service quality.   Among these factors, a modified TAM was included to test its extended influence on the level of satisfaction. In addition, responsiveness, derived from PZB s SERVQUAL model, was included to enhance our understanding of service users behaviour. Moreover to accommodate mobile characteristics such as ubiquitous connectivity and localization, interactivity was included. Finally, customization, playing a role in satisfying customers need, was included as a measure to test customers satisfaction Trust refers to the willingness to rely on an exchange partner in whom one has confidence 34  While trust s main goal is to create a stable relationship in all normal day-to-day business operations 54 trust is an essential element in e-business 11, 37 and is generally needed in every buyer-seller relationship to facilitate the business transaction 54   With trust, companies can increase the acceptance of newly marketed product 16  Moreover, trust has been validated to predict the attitude towards purchasing in an online environment In a MC environment, trust can be perceived as consumers perceptions of particular attributes of mvendors, including the ability, integrity and benevolence of the vendors when handling the consumers transactions 29   In accordance with Lee 33 we adopt the definition of trust in mobile environment as follows: trust is the belief that allows consumers to willingly become vulnerable to mobile Internet site after having taken the Internet site s characteristics into consideration. In analogy with these findings, it may be reflected that 3G-service users trust is expected to increase the behavioral intention to use the 3G service. Thus, it is hypothesized that  H7. Trust directly and positively affects the behavioral intention to use 3G service  Based on Casalo, Flavian and Guinaliu 3  satisfaction can be defined as an affective consumer condition that results from a global evaluation of all the aspects that make up the consumer relationship 53  According to Geyskens, Steenkamp and Kumar [14   satisfaction can be raised by economic conditions \(e.g monetary benefits\ or psychological factors \(e.g promises fulfillment or ease of relationships with retailers\ this study, satisfaction will concentrate on attitudinal psychological aspects that reflect satisfaction from using 3G service Researchers often refer customer satisfaction as the antecedent of trust    Past study validated a positive effect of satisfaction on trust in the on-line environment [42  I n ad d i t i on Ze i t ha ml  B e r r y a n d  Parasuraman u gg es ted t h e v a riable of beh a v i oral  intention is the best indication of customer satisfaction Thus, it can be expected that in a MC environment  H8. Satisfaction directly and positively affects the trust toward using 3G service H9. Satisfaction directly and positively affects the behavioral intention to use 3G service  Figure 1 summarizes the stated hypotheses. The research model attempts to understand two issues. One is to find the influential factors generated from the literature in relation to 3G users satisfaction and the other is to investigate the impact of mobile users  perceptions of task quality on their acceptance of use of 3G service. The model treats the trust as mediating factor of the relationship. It is expected that the components of service quality will affect the mobile users trust and satisfaction, and, in turn, influence the behavioral intention towards the use of 3G related services   Trust  Satisfaction  Behavioral intention Useful ness Responsiveness Customization Interactivity  Useful ness Responsiveness Customization Interactivity  Quality factors   H1 Ease-of-use H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 H9 H8 H7  Figure 1  Research model   3.

representativeness, same survey was also posed on mobile communication-related campus BBS boards in Taiwan during the same period. Online questionnaire has numerous advantages as suggested by Tan and Teo   stan ce, th e y ca n elicit f a ster respon se s  either geographically or demographically. According to Hsu and Lu u c h  m e t h od h a s been  w i del y  u s ed  in recent years.

Measure development  Previous literature was reviewed to ensure a comprehensive list of measures. Components of quality in MC were interactivity, customization responsiveness, usefulness and ease-of-use [33, 25, 48 6, 44, 45 T h e con s tru c ts for satisf actio n  tru s t, a n d  behavioral intention were adapted from Lin & Wang  u  Lu Hsu 22] an d Heij den  Verh ag e n   Creemers  The questionnaire, made up from the review of literature, consisted of 21 items measuring 8 latent variables \(See Appendix A\. Pilot test, involving 50 subjects, was conducted to ensure the clarity of content and the appropriateness of aspects. An item in the construct of responsiveness was deleted during the pilot test. In addition, the questionnaire had two parts The first recorded subjects demographic information while the second asked the subjects to indicate their degree of agreement with each item, which was measured on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree 1 strongly agree 5 An exploratory factor analysis with a varimax rotation \(using SPSS 13.0\as performed on eight factors that correspond to the 9 hypotheses. Table 2 in Appendix B shows the rotated factors with variables properly loaded onto their respective constructs Proportion of total variance explained by the 8 constructs is 78% and Kaiser s measure of sampling adequacy, 075, indicates that variables included in the analysis were reasonably correlated  3.3. Initial internal consistency  The internal consistency was determined by calculating Cronbach s alpha.

 To test the proposed hypotheses, data were collected and analyzed by using the structural equation modeling SEM\econd-generation multivariate technique that combines multiple regressions with confirmatory factor analysis to estimate simultaneously a series of interrelated dependence relationships. SEM has received its popularity in several fields including marketing, psychology, social science and information systems [23, 39   Results of SEM include two components: the measurement model and the structural model. The measurement model, giving relationships between the latent variables and observed variables, aims to provide the internal consistency and validity based on these variables. The structural model, on the other hand studies the path strengths and the direction of the relationships among the latent variables  4.2. The measurement model  A confirmatory factor analysis \(CFA\sing AMOS 5.0 was conducted to test the measurement model Seven model-fit measures were employed to assess the model s overall goodness of fit: the ratio of X 2 to degrees-of-freedom \(d.f.\oodness-of-fit index \(GFI adjusted goodness-of-fit index \(AGFI\mparative fit index \(CFI\orm fit index \(NFI\ot mean square error of approximation \(RMSEA\d root mean square residual \(RMR\ee Table 6 in Appendix B for detailed results. Overall, goodness-of-fit for the model was met, following the suggested cut-off value guideline except NFI. NFI was 0.88, which is slightly below the suggested cut-off value of 0.9. After the overall model was accepted, we proceed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the measurement model in terms of reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity Reliability and convergent validity were estimated by the composite reliability and average variance extracted, respectively \(See Table 4\ Composite reliability for all factors in our measurement model was well above 0.8. Average extracted variances were all above 0.5, which meant that more than one-half of the variances observed in the items were accounted for by their hypothesized factors. Both results satisfied the recommended values Moreov er, c o n v e rg e n t  validity can also be evaluated by examining the factor loadings. Following Hair, Anderson, and Tatham the factor loadings in our model were all above 0.7 indicating a convergent validity. After all, all factors in the measurement model revealed adequate reliability and convergent validity. Note that the following formula the calculation for the composite reliability     2 2  Var C i i i CR i       In words, the composite reliability equals the square of the summation of the factor loadings divided by the sum of the square of the summation of the factor loadings and the summation of error variances To examine discriminant validity, we compared the squared correlations between constructs and variance extracted for a construc T h e res u lts s h o w ed t h at  the square correlations for each construct is less than the average variance extracted \(AVE\ the indicators measuring that construct, as shown in Table 5. The formula for AVE is given by the following formula    2 2 i AVE  Var i V i i       Equally stated, AVE equals the summation of the square of the factor loadings divided by the sum of the summation of the square of the factor loadings and the summation of error variances   Table 4  Reliability  Construct Item Loadings CR AVE Interactivity I1 0.77 0.89 0.73 I2 0.82 I3 0.85 Responsiveness R1 0.75 0.82 0.69 R2 0.78 Customization C1 0.79 0.79 0.77 C2 0.81 C3 0.88 Usefulness U1 0.70 0.85 0.74 U2 0.88 Ease-of-use E1 0.75 0.86 0. 67 E2 0.74 E3 0.72 Satisfaction S1 0.91 0.87 0.77 S2 0.85 Trust T1 0.74 0.84 0.63 T2 0.70 T3 0.85 Behavioral intention BI1 0.76 0.89 0.68 BI2 0.74 BI3 0.84  4.4.

Figure 2 presents the results with non-significant path as a dotted line and the standardized path coefficients between the proposed constructs Hypothesis 1 to 8 but Hypothesis 9 was supported and statistically significant at different confident level Users satisfaction was significantly influenced by the proposed quality dimensions. The path coefficients from the quality factors all together explained approximately 33% of variance in the observed variance in satisfaction. Thus, Hypotheses 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were supported. Moreover, users behavioral intention to use 3G service was significantly influenced by satisfaction and trust. The path coefficients of satisfaction and trust accounted for approximately 22 of observed variance in behavioral intention to use 3G service. Thus, Hypotheses 7 and 8 were supported Note that Hypothesis 9 did not receive any significant statistical support Consistent with our expectations, the modified TAM fits well by the path coefficient of 0.49.

We rely on the bootstrap re-sampling method by setting the number of bootstraps equal to 1000 times and the confidence interval set at 95 The results are listed in the following table  Table 7 Effects on behavioral intention to use 3G service  Construct Direct effects Indirect effects Total effects Satisfaction 0.23 0.04 0.27  5. Discussion and implication  Motivated by the need to understand the formation of satisfaction, we conducted an online survey to empirically investigate proposed factors affecting user satisfaction of using 3G service with wireless handheld devices.  One of the main contributions was that we found that factors of interactivity, responsiveness customization, usefulness and ease-of-use significantly affected the satisfaction. While testing the variables of trust and satisfaction that influence behavioral intention to use 3G service, another contribution was to realize satisfaction having an existing casual relationship between trust and behavioral intention Most importantly, satisfaction was validated as the antecedent of behavioral intention to use 3G service Although satisfaction was shown to influence behavioral intention to use 3G service, satisfaction also exerts its influential power indirectly through the mediating variable, trust, impacting on a higher behavioral intention. Practically, this result implies that building a trust relationship between users and network operators may be as important as finding ways to improve users satisfaction. Moreover, trust was shown to be an important research issue in mobile commerce Previous research showed that trust building in mobile commerce can be enhanced through the factors of users perceptions of service quality such as site quality, business competence and security issues that arise from conducting business activi r model lent support to this trust building concept However, trust, in our observations, did not influence behavioral intention to use 3G service. This may be due to the reason that indirect experiences \(ex. wordof-mouth\were not treated as good way to determine the intention to use 3G service Several implications for market practitioners are raised. At first, understanding how satisfaction is built and improved is important for 3G operators because higher satisfaction with service provided may result in a greater customer base. Secondly, service quality factors such as interactivity, customization and responsiveness play keys to improve the satisfaction towards the use of 3G service. Thus, 3G operators should provide an interactive and customized mobile online environment for users especially for their first time use. Thirdly, service feedback is attention demanding. Users need the readily response from 3G service providers when they encounter usage problems A major practical implication of this study lies with verifying ease-of-use and usefulness to be another two important factors affecting users satisfaction. This finding implies that mobile software must be based on users needs. Interface design and the constraints of mobile devices are especially of great importance Furthermore, higher satisfaction refers to the attitude change, which may lead to the behavioral intention to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


use the service.  Thus, operators should concern more on the obstacles or barriers that may distract or degenerate users attitude towards the satisfaction level Lastly, satisfaction for the behavioral intention to use the service through trust has significant impact. Thus 3G service operators should concern on providing a trustable service that does exert a persuasive influence The implication for research suggests that an examination of proposed service quality measurement may provide insights into the causality relationship with satisfaction. This would be the case for explaining why the combined quality factors have statistically significant effect on satisfaction and behavioral use decisions One of limitations of this study lies with the source of the data. The statistically significant result of satisfaction s impact on behavioral intention to use 3G service may not be applicable to 3G service providers in other countries. Another limitation would be that we might have omitted other as important factors as ones that affect service satisfaction in this study. Thus, the proposed satisfaction measurement may not possess the sole right to reflect satisfaction For the future work, we may pay attention to improve R-square. This can be done by exploring and investigating hedonic factors. Factors that can improve the quality of service can be seen as hedonic such as mobile connectivity and mobile enjoyment. Besides, it is interesting to investigate cognitive factors. Factors of cognition refer to the mental process of viewing the service such as expectancy of satisfaction confirmation Furthermore, a slightly modified version of TAM was included in our framework. Despite being an important indicator of satisfaction, extensive research has shown the consequences induced by TAM. Thus, it remains interesting to investigate the antecedents of usefulness and ease-of-use in 3G service context. Future researchers may investigate very specific quality of 3G service and their impacts on usefulness and ease-of-use so as to complement the fundamentals in 3G research issues  6. Conclusion  Acceptance of 3G service is crucial for the growth of mobile commerce. This paper sheds light on the aspect of satisfaction that acts as a fundamental to influence the 3G service acceptance, thus suggesting service users be equally important to the business operation compared to the 3G technology integration. Although communication technology facilitates the transaction activities, to 3G service providers, a well-designed service plan to accommodate users need cannot be absent, which will be especially useful for the first time users as it affects their further service subscription After a satisfactory initial use, it becomes easy for service providers to promote further business service in mobile commerce In Taiwan, the mobile commerce is open to business opportunities for service providers. As more users subscribe the service and enter the market, the demand for the mobile service will continue to grow and take off. How to retain old users, attract new users and comfort existing users become important issues especially brand switching is a common practice in Taiwan. The results of this study suggest that by focusing and improving the service quality s factors service providers can achieve a better service satisfaction. In turn, higher satisfaction may help service providers either retain the old customers or attract new service subscribers  7.

departments on average\ignificant differences were found regarding the age of the applications. The variables for the coverage of the products and processes were not included in this test because the overlap was computed using these two variables implying that there is a significant relation between the respective variables\his lends some support to proposition P2.4 stating that involvement of more users leads to greater overlap of applications. The proposition that older applications also exhibit a higher degree of overlap was not supported \(P1.4  A.2. Results from analyzing impacts of AA complexity  Impacts of interdependency-related AA complexity A Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 4\ealed a statistically significant difference in operations cost as well as maintenance cost across the three different interdependency-groups of applications. The more interdependent group \(i.e. applications with 3-7 or with 8 or more interfaces\igher median of operations \(Md=119,000 and 363,000 EUR respectively\ and maintenance costs \(Md=326,000 and 506,000 EUR respectively\ than the less interdependent group \(fewer than 3 interfaces applications \(Md=52,000 EUR operations costs and 64,000 EUR maintenance costs\. This supports the proposition \(P3.1\ that more interdependent applications also incur higher IT \(operations and maintenance\ts  Impacts of diversity-related AA complexity   Regarding OS-related diversity, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 5\howed no significant difference between the operations costs of more \(Md=93,890 n=105\d less diverse applications \(Md=131,540 n=27\09.5, z=-1.174, p=.24. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=166,400; n=121 vs Md=116,900; n =31\782, z=-.43; p=.668 To measure DBMS-related diversity, a MannWhitney U test was conducted \(Table 5\d revealed no significance difference in operations costs of more Md=129,985; n=85\d less diverse applications Md=154,777; n=16\5, z=-.237, p=.813. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=210,500 n=98 vs. Md=245,700; n=19\36, z=-.704 p=.481. Hence, the proposition \(P3.2\ that diversityrelated AA complexity leads to higher IT costs is not supported  Impacts of deviation-related AA complexity   Regarding deviation from the standard OS, a MannWhitney U test \(Table 6\revealed no significant difference between the maintenance costs and operations costs for standard-compliant \(Md=83,581 n=94 for operations cost and Md=148,300; n=113 for maintenance cost\nd non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=38 for operations cost and Md=166,400; n=39 for maintenance cost z=-1.921, p=.055 for operations cost and U=2116 z=-.371, p=.711 for maintenance cost Concerning deviation from the standard DBMS, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 6\ealed a significant difference between maintenance costs for standardcompliant \(Md=373,100; n=59\d non-standardcompliant applications \(Md=170,200; n=58 U=1303, z=-2.231, p=.026. It is remarkable that the non-compliant applications had lower maintenance costs than the compliant applications. The difference between operations costs for compliant Md=109,978; n=51\d non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=50\s not significant, U=1196.5 z=-.533, p=.594 Thus, the proposition \(P3.3\at application that deviate from technology standards incur higher IT costs is not supported. In contrast, for DBMSstandard deviation, we observed significantly lower maintenance cost for non-compliant than for compliant applications  Impacts of overlap/redundancy-related AA complexity a Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 7\ showed significant differences in operations costs across the applications with a low \(less than 34 overlaps Md=90,442; n=37\edium \(35-79 overlaps Md=55,770; n=56\ and high level of overlap/redundancy \(more than 80 overlaps Md=129,985; n=61 6.862, p=.032. It is striking to see that the applications with medium overlaps have a lower median operations cost than those with a low or high-level of overlap, implying a non-linear U-shape relation between overlap and operations cost. Interestingly, the same holds true for maintenance cost. Applications with a low degree of overlap exhibited a median maintenance cost of 96,600 \(n=59\, those with a medium level of overlap incurred a median of 81,300 \(n=58\d highly overlapping applications a median of 248,700 \(n=67 9.791, p=.007. Hence, the proposition \(P3.4\at applications with a greater degree of overlap also exhibit higher IT costs is not supported  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 12

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
