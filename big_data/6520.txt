action and make informed decisions too Application performance management can help observe and manage the performance of the wide area network, and the business-critical applications that run over it, including Voice over Internet Protocol \(VoIP   V.  WAN OPTIMIZATION APPLIANCES DEVICES Supporting in this task of enhancing network performance around the well spread WAN and Internet are WAN Optimization Appliances related technology devices, WAN Optimization Controllers, and other such Optimization products Compression, Protocol Optimization, Caching Boosting Efficiency of Transmission Control Protocol \(TCP\orcing Quality of Service QoS\ethods are the techniques used by these appliances and devices  A. Benefits of WAN Optimization Appliances Devices    Advances the Transaction time between sites 90% or even more   Boost up  the usability experience for users   Occupies various techniques to reduce WAN traffic across WAN circuits, compress Internet Protocol \(IP\ traffic that is transmitted over the network, and eliminate Congestion in the path   Quicker response time for applications and database/resources access, and high throughput are the result of the presence of WAN optimizers at both ends of WAN links which fine tunes the IP traffic  B. WAN Optimization Controllers \(WOCs  They are committed devices that are normally used for enhancing the application response time They are deployed on a WAN link on either end. A WAN Optimization Controller is typically a Customer Premises Equipment \(CPE connected to WAN Routers on the Local Area Network \(LAN\ide. By purposefully deploying WOCs at data centers and remote locations application performance over WANs can be substantially improved. WOCs are focused on improving the response time of business-sensitive applications that are conducted across WAN links  a\ Complementing WAN optimization controller investment for Big dat a and bulk data transfer  17   Due to their nature WAN optimization controllers \(WOCs\no t accelerate big data and bulk data transfers typically needed for remote backup, disaster recovery, data migration demanding business intelligence applications. In order to accelerate also those data intensive transfers dedicated file tr ansfer acceleration \(FTA solutions can be deployed and thereby complement your WAN optimization strategy and leverage the overall investment A WAN optimization strategy that also addresses big data and bulk data transfers should comprise a mixture of standard WAN optimization controllers and dedicated file transfer acceleration solutions. It is crucial to identify the hot spots in this ecosystem and its corresponding processes and deploy carefully chosen FTA solutions accordingly to leverage the impact of the overall investment There are only a few vendors that provide FTA solutions, each with a different focus  b\  WAN optimization co ntroller comparison Evaluating vendors and products 18  IT organizations have a growing interest in deploying WAN optimization controllers \(WOCs as a way to implement network and application optimization on branch office networks. One of the factors driving this interest in WAN optimization vendors and products is the fact that many organizations have taken applications out of branch offices and consolidated them in centralized data centers. This, combined with the fact that only a minority of employees now work at a headquarters site, means that the vast majority of employees now access applications over a relatively low-speed high-latency WAN. In addition to low speed and high latency, the WAN also suffers from quality issues such as dropped packets or packets that are out of order The amount of application traffic that transits the WAN will only increase, as companies increase their use of Software as a Service and other forms of public and private cloud computing This will lead then to have more interest in deploying  WAN optimization and acceleration  WOCs benefit businesses by improving the performance of applications that run over the WAN and/or reducing WAN ba ndwidth expense These products improve performance by   Reducing the amount of data sent over the WAN by implementing functionality such as caching and compression    Mitigating the impact of inefficient network protocols such as TCP   Protecting traffic that is delay sensitive and business critical e.g., VoIP from being affected by other traffic types through the implementation of mechanisms like quality of service \(QoS classification and traffic shaping 282 282 282 282

  7 5  T RACKER SEQUENCE  The Tracker Sequence is the output file of the SRS/Timeliner-TLX TM file parser. This file will be compiled which generates an executable and a listing file The executable is then installed into the Timeliner-TLX TM Executor / Engine. Upon installation, the operator must start the Tracker Sequence. As soon as the Tracker Sequence becomes active, this sequence will run every second scanning for active bundles. The first check in the sequence will determine if a given bundle is active. The logic will then decide if the specified sequence in the current bundle is active. If the sequence is active, it will then check if the sequence statement is within a range of line numbers. If the active sequence lies between the sequence statement range a message will then be logged to the Timeliner-TLX TM  engine log file indicating a requirement has been encountered. Figure 10 depicts the Tracker Sequence code Figure 10 \226 Tracker Sequence Code Example  6  R EAL TIME EXECUTION  The Tracker Sequence must be started first in the execution order as installing the HAL_Main Bundle will begin autonomous operations for the AFTS Test-Bed. The Tracker Sequence monitors for the bundle installation of HAL_Main. When the bundle is installed, sequences within the bundle become \223active\224 automatically. Once the HAL_Main bundle installation is detected, the Tracker Sequence monitors for the individual sequences to become active. Once the sequences become active, Timeliner-TLX TM begins reporting execution line numbers. The Tracker Sequence monitors the reported line numbers for requirement ranges, matching a line number to the requirement line number ranges. When a match is found, a message statement is issued to the Timeliner-TLX TM  console. A log message is written to the log file. This same interaction is performed for each bundle and sequence that is installed and becomes \223active\224, as many times as the sequence is executed. After the test-plan is executed, the log is utilized for analysis of requirement coverage. For the AFTS Test-Bed, the log depicts the time of execution and the order of the test-plan as executed in real-time. If multiple test plans are to be executed, such as an autonomous plan of fluid transfers, the Tracker sequence can simply stay active as it continually scans for bundle installations and active sequences until manually stopped by the operator. There are occasions where a requirement is satisfied by only a few lines of code producing a line number range that is small. The AFTS Test-Bed had one requirement \(validate transfer quantity\ which  encompassed only one or two lines of code. During testing the team noticed the validation requirement was not being reported, although the validation code was executed. This meant that the Timeliner-TLX TM execution engine was executing these lines of code rapidly enough that the reported execution line was past the requirement bounded code. The TLX engine executes at a 1 Hz rate within the CPU, and the number of statements that the engine can execute is dependent upon the number of sequences that are currently active. The more sequences that are active, the less number of statements within each sequence are executed The solution to force reporting of bounded statements is to place a \223Wait 1\224 statement within the requirement range The WAIT statement provides a one second wait in execution and will force the sequence to give up its execution time slice within the TLX engine, and the current line number will be reported  7  L OG OUTPUT AND ANALYSIS  Figure 11 shows the log output produced by the Tracker Sequence. The time frame of this log file shows the initialization of the AFTS through three autonomous fluid transfers; one via the back-up leg with one of a quarter tank quantity, a second transfer where the crew selects the quantity transferred over the backup leg, and the third transfer which is a crew selectable quantity transferred over the primary leg. During initialization of the AFTS, the software system queries the crew on the status of manual valves which does not provide telemetry. If the manual valves are not in an operational state, or the query is not Sequence TRACKER Active We start our control loop to monitor every second  Every 1.0 then If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.BUNSTAT = BUN_ACTIVE Then -- Is the bundle active If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.Initialize.SEQSTAT = SEQ_ACTIVE Then -- Is the Initialize Sequence active If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.Initialize.SEQSTMT IN 25..38 then -- Current line within the req range Message "GAFTS-0001 Manual Valve Status Query Requirement End If If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.Initialize.SEQSTMT IN 39..54 then -- Current line within the req range Message "GAFTS-0006 Autonomous Procedure Installation Requirement End If End If End If 


  8 answered within one minute, the system inhibits the autonomous installation of auto-procedures preventing operation of the test bed in a non-operational state. The log traces the date and time, the requirement encountered and executed, the Timeliner-TLX TM Bundle Name that contained the requirement, the tracking tag of the bundle which is created at compilation time and utilized for configuration management of the software system, and the requirement ID including the text that was encountered during execution. The Tracking Tag is another unique feature of the Timeliner-TLX TM system as this internal identifier is also reported in telemetry during execution allowing operations to uniquely identify the procedures in execution. The Tracking Tag can be decoded as it is a date/time stamp, produced in binary coded decimal, after a successful compilation of the procedure. The log output shows that after the crew manual valve query, autonomous installation of the AFTS software occurred and that three fluid transfers of different types were directed by the crew The log is then used to determine which requirements were met during the current test plan. In this way, test plans can be tailored to include operations that were missed. Software Quality personnel can now scan the log for requirement and test plan analysis for anomalies encountered during testing Figure \226 11 Timeline-TLX Log Output Example  8  S UMMARY  The Command and control procedures developed utilizing the Timeliner-TLX TM within AFTS test-bed have been instrumental in proving the concept of automated and autonomous operations for a deep space mission. The testing has helped to pave the path for extended research and validating the transition from auto-procedure to flight software. The idea of moving command and control from ground control centers to th e crew on a manned deep space mission involves extended research of how to develop intelligent auto-procedures and how much of the operational environment will change. The early analysis of Autoprocedures has shown that there are 4 types of procedures Extensive testing and research will be needed to solidify this confidence and exactly detail the development requirements for auto-procedures to be an accepted norm for operations Further hardware software integration testing will lead to a more detailed concept of what an autonomous architecture will entail and how to qualify the software for flight. The Timeliner-TLX TM system\222s unique line reporting feature provides a process to verify and validate what requirements are met in real time to aid hardware and software designers in this endeavor. It is envisioned that on-board intelligent auto-procedures will be required on manned deep space missions due to the extreme communications delays, and auto-procedure updates will still be occurring with Earth based assets. A rapid verification and validation of autoprocedures will be needed for such \223on mission\224 vehicle updates   R EFERENCES  1  Stetson, H.K.; Haddock, A.T.; \223Automated Operations Development for Advanced Exploration Systems,\224 American Institute of Aerona utics and Astronautics, Space Ops 2012, Stockholm Sweden  TIME TAG            BUNDLE NAME                     TRACKING TAG      MESSAGE TEXT  07/16/13 09:22:18 REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151   GAFTS-0001 Manual Valve Requirement 07/16/13 09:22:24  REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151     GAFTS-0006 Autonomous Procedure Requirement 07/16/13 09:22:26  REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151     GAFTS-0006 Autonomous Procedure Requirement 07/16/13 09:22:27  REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151     GAFTS-0006 Autonomous Procedure requirement 07/16/13 09:27:58  REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151    AAFTS-0002 Quarter Tank Transfer Requirement 07/16/13 09:38:10 REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151  AAFTS-0008 Crew Transfer Requirement 07/16/13 09:39:37 REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151  AAFTS-0007 Crew Return Requirement

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
