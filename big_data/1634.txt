The traditional approach is based on the \nattributes or contexts of the objects, not using the information \nof some attribute which may propagate between the objects \nand the attributes. To this end we propose an approach which \nuses probabilistic topic model to improve the accuracy. We\nfirst model the attribute which has unstructured information \nand get its topics which may propagate to object as a new nattribute; and then calculate the similarity values of the \ncontext attributes of the two objects with identical names, then \nwe use these similarity values to build a decision tree model \nbased on the training set. For the problem of object distinction \nfor people, we combine the affiliation similarity with other ncontext attributes similarity to judge whether the two people \nwho share the same name correspond to the same people in \nreal life. Experiments show that our method using \nProbabilistic Topic Model can achieve high accuracy.\nKeywords- Latent Dirichlet Allocation; decision tree; context \nattribute; object distinction \nI INTRODUCTION\nThe explosive growth and popularity of the World Wide \nWeb results in a huge amount of data sources \(structured,\nsemi-unstructured and unstructured data entered the age of big data [1].\nIntegrating the large-scale, various and valuable web data \naccurately and efficiently is particularly important for \napplications such as market intelligence, public opinion \nanalysis business intelligence and has good application \neffect and broad prospects. In the traditional data integration, \nbased on the “garbage in, garbage out” rule, the quality of \nthe data which is needed to be integrated must be paid more \nattention. Object distinction [2] is a critical component of \ndata integration and data cleaning.  \nObject distinction can be used to judge whether a number \nof objects with identical names point to one entity in the real \nworld. Different people or objects may share identical names, \nwhich causes confusion in many applications . A typical \nexample is in DBLP, many authors have identical names, \nthen retrieval one time will get many unrelated records and \nthe user cannot distinguish them easily. For example there \nare 173 papers in DBLP written by at least 14 d ifferent “Wei \nWang”s.\nIn the big data, the unstructured data turn into the main  \nform, e.g. the textual documents, which have rich \ninformation. The tradit ional approach is based on the \nattributes or contexts of the objects  [2], not using the \ninformation of some attribute which may propagate between \nthe objects and the attributes through the information \nnetwork 19, 21]. \nTo this end, we propose an approach which uses \nprobabilistic topic model to improve the accuracy We first \nmodel the attribute which has unstructured information and \nget its topics which may propagate to object as new attribute; \nand then calculate the similarity values of the context \nattributes of the two objects with identical names, at last we \nuse these context attributes similarity values to build a \ndecision tree model based on the training set.  \nFor the problem of object distinction for people, we \ncombine the affiliation similarity with other context \nattributes similarity to judge whether the two people who \nshare the same name correspond to the same people in real \nlife. Experiments show that our method using probabilistic \ntopic model can achieve high accuracy.  \nThe remainder of the paper is organized  as follows We \nbegin with a discussion of related work in Section II. This is \nfollowed  by the problem description and modeling \ndocuments with topics  in Section III. Section IV gives the \nsimilarity calculated and the object distinction model, and \nthen Section V presents a description of the data used in \nexperiments and the results of experiments. Finally, Section \nVI presents the conclusions.\nII. RELATED WORKS \nIn recent years, methods of object distinction around \ndifferent data sources have attracted wide attention and \nresearch, and various technologies continue to be improved.\nEntity matching is a complex and ubiquitous problem \nthat appears in numerous  application domains \(including \nimage processing, information extraction and integration, \nand natural language processing e.g., coreference resolution [20], record linkage \n[3], and deduplication  unstructured data need to be \nappropriately structured by means of information extraction, \nand for some text with potential structure \(such as references, \naddress information, etc nThe documents are not certain format, which results to \nreduce of accuracy of the data processing. \nRecord linkage [3] is dedicated to merging similar \nrecords which are judged to be pointed to the same entity in \nthe real world, and it has always been referred to together \n2013 International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data\n978-1-4799-2829-3/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.61\n17730 9 4 31 4\nwith object distinction. Traditional work on record linkage \nexist the problem of efficiency on acquiring the object pairs nand accuracy on distinguishing or merging similar records \n[3,5,6 8,9]. Existed record linkage always gives 


different \nweights to each of this context attributes using machine \nlearning techniques such as SVM perception learn ing [8], \nand then use a regression equation to get the result similarity \nof objects \nThe traditional object distinction considers mainly  \nfocuses on the problem of distinguishing different objects nwith identical names. The methods are to use the context \ninformation linked with the objects[7], but they didn’t \nconsider the hierarchy relationship between the contexts \nattributes and  ignore the information of some attribute \nwhich may propagate between the objects and the \nattributes[10,22,23] . \nIII. PRELIMINARIES nIn the real world, there exist many objects with identical \nnames but pointing to different real world entities. Our goal  \nis to distinguish those objects correctly. In this section, we\ndescribe the problem of object distinction and topic model. \nWe assume that the data to be analyzed consists of both a \ncollection of text documents and associated objects. \nA.  Problem formulation \nLet A1, A2, A3…An be a series of objects with identical \nnames, all of them are in a set A, A= {A1, A2, A3…An}.For \neach given Ai, Ak?A \(i, k?[1,n problem of object \ndistinction is to give a class for the object pair \( Ai , Ak which means the two objects point to one \nentity in the real world, “no” means not.\nDue to the objects has rich context attributes linked,\nSuppose the context attributes set connected with the objects \nin set A is C.C= {c1, c2…cm}.For each Ai in A, there is a \nvector in which every element represents the value of Ai for nan attribute in C. So Ai = \(vi,1, vi,2…vi,m vx,y represents the \nvalue of Ax for the context attribute cy vectors into one, that is \n\(s1, s2,…sm an attribute in C. Then these similarity \nvalues will be used to construct a decision tree model to \nclassify more unseen object pairs. \nIn this paper, we calculate the maximum informat ion \ngain of different attributes at each node, the value of the\ninformat ion is based on class distributions at the node, then\nwe select the best attribute to put at the node to maximally\nreduce the impurity of the instances, this process will be\nrepeated until the node can classify the instances with good\npurity and then the node will be a terminal node, after that we \nprune the tree to get a more accurately and smaller model.\nB. Modeling documents with topics \nTextual documents are not only getting richer, but also \nubiquitously interconnected with users and other objects in \nvarious ways, and the interactions among multi-typed objects \nplay a key role at d isclosing the rich semantics of the \nnetwork. Taking bibliographic data as an example, as \nresearchers are regularly publishing papers in various venues \n\(e.g., journals, conferences, etc author title, organization, venue distribution of an object without \nexp licit text information \(e.g., Fig. 1 ndistribution of the documents it connects. The research area \n\(topic u by his/her \npublished papers \(d modeling document \ncontent are based upon the idea that the probability \ndistribution over words in a document can be expressed as a \nmixture of topics, where each topic is  a probability \ndistribution over words .We will describe one such model \nLatent Dirichlet Allocation \(LDA  probabilistic \nmodel for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. \nThe LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model \n\(Fig.2 an underlying set of topics.

Similarity Calculation\nObjects’ context attributes contain much information for\nobject distinction, and some of these attributes can classify \nobject pairs with fine performance. For the problem of object \ndistinction for 


people, the context attributes such as research, \ncoauthor and affiliation of the author have the specific ncharacteristic. We utilize this characteristic and the hierarchy \nrelationship between context attributes to build a decision \ntree model. \nIn order to distinguish objects with identical names, the \nsimilarity of the context of the two objects must be obtained. \nTherefore, we calculate the similarity of each context nattribute. \nObjects’ context attributes can be summed up following \nthree types: attributes with topics of document, attributes \nwith the value type of string and attributes with the value \ntype of numeral. We will respectively describe the methods \nof similarity calculat ion for both of the value types. \n1 similarity calculation: Owing to using \ntopics to describe the document, similarity of document can \nbe calculated through their topic probability distribution. As \na result of each topic is characterized by a d istribution over \nword, we use KL\(Kullabck-Leiber  Divergence is following: \n\n\b\n\b\nT\nj j\nj\njKL q\np\nlnpq,pD\n1\n??\n                                              \(3 nFor all given j, when pj=qj, DKL\(p, q p, q q, p the symmetric formula is often \nused. \n????????\n??\n 1p,qD-q-p,pD\nq,pD\nKLKL \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\b 11\n n\(4 proved\n???? p,qDq,pD\n\t\t\n\b\n                                         \(5 4 JS\(Jensen-Shannon  n\n\n\n\n\n\n\b ??????\n222\n1 qp,qDqp,pDq,pD KLKLJS\n     \(6 ncompute the similarity of document \n2 comparison can be used to calculate the similarity \nof string attributes. This paper uses TFIDF method and the nJaccard distance method. TFIDF weight is a statistical \nmeasure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a  \ndocument in a corpus. \nIn the TFIDF method, first, we build a string set which \ncontains all of the string values appear at this attribute; then,\nwe use a TFIDF object to train this string set; next, we\ncalculate a TFIDF score for the two strings, each string is \nregarded as a document; and lastly, we use the vector space nmodel together with cosine similarity to determine the \nsimilarity between two documents.  \nAffiliation information can be obtained easily through \nseveral approaches. We can obtain them from some available ndatabases connected with the objects, or we can get them \nfrom Internet. There are also some existing approaches \nwhich can be used to get the affiliation information of people \n[18]. Affiliation information of people is usually string. We \nchoose TFIDF method to compare the affiliation strings.  \n3 similarity calculation: For\nattributes with the value type of numeral, we can calculate \nthe similarity of the two values using the method based on\ncoefficient of variation [10,15].\nB. Building the Decision Tree Model\nIn this paper, some context attributes can be used to \nclassify instances with good performance and can split the nobject pairs into several branches and gain a good purity, so \nthe decision tree method is chosen to learn a model from the \ntraining set. The BF-tree [10] is the best-first decision tree,\nand it is used to work on the training set. The “best” node is \nthe node that maximally reduces impurity among all nodes \navailable for splitting. The impurity is the opposite of the \npurity; we can measure it by the information of the node. \nThe BF-tree works as the following: \n1. Select an attribute from all the context attributes , place \nat the root node and make some branches for this  attribute \nbased on some criteria. \n2. Split training object pairs into subsets, one for each \nbranch extending from the root node. \n3. Repeat step 1 and step 2 for a chosen branch until all  \nnodes are pure or a specific number of expansions are \nreached. \nIn each step we choose the “best node from all nodes \nwhich are availab le for expansions. \n179\nC. Algorithm Description\nOur works on object distinction can be summed up into \nthree parts: \n1. Document Modeling. In this process we use \nprobabilistic topic models to obtain the mixtures of \nprobability distributions \n2. Data preparation. We construct object pairs and \ncalculate similarity values for the corresponding attributes in \neach object pair. \n3. Model building. That is, using supervised machine \nlearning to get the decision tree model and test the model.  \nThe overall algorithms are as follows: \nAlgorithm: Object Distinction utilizing Probabilistic \nTopic Model\nInput:data document\nOutput: a class of “yes” or “no” for every object pair \nin database table\nBegin\nDocument Modeling\nbegin\nDocuments_read\nDo statistical probability distributions\nend\nData preparation\nbegin\nData_read\nCalculate_context_attributes_similarity\nend\nModel building\nbegin\nLearn_a_BF-tree_ model\nTest_the _model\nClassify_unknown_dataset\nend\nEnd\nV. EXPERIMENT\nA. Data \nWe experiment our method on DBLP database. We get a \ndblp document with the file  type of “xml”. A tool in SQL \nSERVER 2008 named “sqlxml” can help to import the xml \ndocument into database, We remove authors with no more \nthan 2 papers and obvious unmatched object pairs through \nthe Blocking algorithm.From all we choose 6172 pairs of \nobjects to construct a dataset as the training set, in which 723 \npapers and 32 topics. \nFor each author, the context attributes which we get \nthrough association rules are coauthor, the research area \(the \ntopic of paper 


affiliation. \nFor an object pair, we can get two strings of coauthors \ninformation of the two objects. We get a score of the \nsimilarity of the two strings by the Jaccard distance method.\nThe Jaccard value is a statistic used for comparing the \nsimilarity and diversity of sample sets, and then we use \nTFIDF method to calculate the affiliation similarity using the \nmethod described [18] and store into the relational table as \nthe affisim” attribute.\nBecause an author can be connected with several the \ntopics of paper \(the research area we use a LDA model \nobtain mixtures of probability distributions  of the topics and \nthen calculate the similarity of papers on topics, that is, the \nsimilarity of authors on research area. \nB. Main results \nIn this paper we use BF-tree to work on the training set \nwhich contains 6172 object pairs and learn a binary model \non the platform of weka and output a decision tree, then we \nuse the post pruning algorithm to prune the tree to get a more \naccurate and smaller model.

match ?ag of\neach vertex becomes true if its label matches the label\nof a vertex in Q. In this case, a local match set, called\nmatchSet, will be created to keep track of its potential\nmatches in the query graph. Each vertex, then, learns about\nthe matchSets of its children in the ?rst three supersteps\nand keeps them in a local list in order to evaluate graph\nsimulation conditions.

Summary of Distributed Graph Simulation algorithm\nits local matchSet that does not satisfy the simulation con-\nditions and then informs its parents about any changes in its\nmatchSet. Consequently, each vertex that receives changes\nin its childrens matchSets re?ects those changes in its list\nof match children and reevaluates its own matchSet. The\nalgorithm terminates after the third superstep if no vertex\nremoves any match from its matchSet. This procedure will\ncontinue in superstep four and beyond until no vertex makes\nany change in its matchSet. In order to make sure that\nthe algorithm will terminate, any active vertex without an\nincoming message votes to halt after the third superstep.\nAt the end of execution, the local matchSet of a vertex\ncontains the correct and complete set of matches between\nthat vertex and the vertices of the query graph.\nIn an example displayed in ?gure 5, all the vertices of\nthe data graph labeled A and B make their match ?ag\ntrue at the ?rst superstep, and then vertices 1, 2, 3 and 4\nsend messages to their children. At the second superstep\nvertices 1, 2, 3 and 4 will reply back to their parents. At\nthe third superstep, vertices 1, 2, and 3 can successfully\nvalidate their match set, but vertex 4 makes its ?ag false\nbecause it receives no message from any child. Therefore,\nvertex 4 sends a removal message to vertex 3. This message\nwill be received by vertex 3 at superstep four and will cause\nits ?ag to becomes false. Similarly, vertex 3 sends a removal\nmessage to vertex 2 which will be received at superstep ?ve.\nVertex 2 will successfully reevaluate its match set, and the\nalgorithm will ?nish at superstep six when every vertex has\nvoted to halt \(there is no further communication proposed distributed algorithm can\nbe derived from the following lemmas.\n407\nFigure 5. An example for distributed graph simulation\nLemma 1: The proposed distributed algorithm for graph\nsimulation will successfully terminate. \nLemma 2: At the end of the proposed algorithm, the\nmatchSet of each vertex contains the correct and complete\nset of matches for that vertex. \nFigure 5 demonstrates the number of supersteps in the\nworst case. One can verify that if the length of path 1,2,3,4\nis increased to lp in such a way that the label pattern of\nvertices 3 and 4 are repeated, the algorithm will need lp+1\nsupersteps to terminate. In general, the minimum number of\nsupersteps is 3, and its upper bound is O\(E Simulation\nThe distributed algorithm for dual simulation is a smart\nmodi?cation of the algorithm proposed for graph simulation\nin the previous subsection; hence, we just explain the dif-\nferences. Recalling the de?nition of dual simulation, each\nvertex needs to evaluate both child and parent relation-\nships; therefore, each vertex needs to keep one local set,\nmatchSet, and two local lists, one storing the list of match\nchildren, and the other storing the list of match parents.\nAt the ?rst superstep each vertex sends not only its ID,\nbut also its label to its children. At the second superstep\na vertex can infer the matchSets of its parents from the\nreceived labels and store them in the list of match parents.\nHaving this initial list at the second superstep allows each\nvertex to verify the parent relationships for each of the\ncandidate matches in its matchSet. Very similar to the idea\nexplained in the previous subsection for child relationships,\nremovals from matchSet caused by evaluating the parents\nrelationship must be reported to the children. The rest of the\nalgorithm remains more or less parallel to the algorithm for\ngraph simulation, with a few small modi?cations to account\nfor the evaluation of a vertex with respect to its parent\nrelationships.\nSimilar to graph simulation, the upper bound on the\nnumber of required supersteps for the distributed algorithm\nof dual simulation to be terminated is O\(|E distributed strong simulation is built\non top of the algorithm for distributed dual simulation.\nEach vertex that has successfully passed the ?lter of dual\nsimulation will create a ball around itself to compute strong\nsimulation. The main challenge, however, is the overhead\nthat arises from creating the balls. Recalling their de?nitions,\neach ball in strong simulation is an induced connected\nsubgraph of the data graph; whereas each ball in strict\nsimulation is an induced connected subgraph of the dual\nmatch graph.\nThe distributed algorithms that we have designed and\nimplemented for strong and strict simulation follow the\n?owcharts of 


gure 2, but in a distributed fashion. The\n?rst step for applying dual simulation is the same as the\ndistributed algorithm for dual simulation. As mentioned, at\nthe end of dual simulation each vertex of the data graph\nhas a matchSet that contains the IDs of vertices of the\nquery graph that match to that vertex. Each vertex with\na non-empty matchSet makes a ball centered at itself in\na breadth-?rst search \(BFS takes 2\(dQ ? 1 members of a ball. How-\never for strict simulation, only vertices with the member\n?ag set to true will answer the request for neighborhood\ninformation. Moreover, while the center vertex of the ball\nreceives neighborhood information, it adds a vertex to the\nball only if there is a corresponding edge in the pattern\ngraph Eventually, the center vertex of each ball will perform\nthe rest of the computation on that ball for either strong or\nstrict simulation in a sequential fashion. Because vertices are\ndistributed among workers, this phase can be considered an\nembarrassingly parallel workload.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY\nThe goal of this experimental study is to evaluate the\nfour proposed distributed algorithms and to learn about their\nbottlenecks and design trade-offs with respect to properties\nof the inputs. We have used GPS [10], which can be\nconsidered a free distribution of Pregel, to implement our\ndistributed algorithms. GPS is written in Java and has an\nextended API to provide a type of global communication\namong vertices.\nParameters that we consider for data graphs are the\nnumber of vertices, denoted by |V |, the density of the graph,\ndenoted by parameter ?, where |V |? equals the number of\nedges, and the number of distinct labels, denoted by l. In\nall experiments, l = 200, unless it is mentioned explicitly.\nThe only parameter considered for queries is the number of\nvertices, denoted by |Vq|. Moreover, the number of workers\nused in each experiment is another parameter, denoted by k.\nA. Experimental setting\nBoth real world and synthesized datasets were used in our\nexperiments. In terms of real world datasets, we used uk-\n2002 with 18,520,486 vertices and 298,113,762 edges; and\nljournal-2008 which has 5,363,260 vertices and 79,023,142\nedges1.\nWe used graph-tool [15] to synthesize small and medium\nsize randomly generated data graphs, but because of its\n1http://law.di.unimi.it/datasets.php\n408\nphysical memory limits we also implemented our own syn-\nthesizer to generate large semi-randomly generated graphs.\nThe input parameters of our graph synthesizer are the\nnumber of vertices n, the average number of outgoing edges\ndO, and the number of distinct labels l. It selects an integer\nbetween 0 and 2dO as the number of outgoing edges for\nevery vertex. Then, for each outgoing edge, the endpoint of\nthe edge is randomly selected. The label of each vertex is\nalso a randomly selected number between 0 and l.\nTo generate a pattern graph, we randomly extract a\nconnected subgraph from a given dataset. Our query gen-\nerator has two input parameters: the number of vertices\nand the desired average number of outgoing edges Unless\nmentioned otherwise, the average number of outgoing edges\nis set to such a value that ? = 1.2.\nThe experiments were conducted using GPS on a cluster\nof 12 machines. Each one has 128GB DDR3 RAM, two\n2GHz Intel Xeon E5-2620 CPUs, each with 6 cores. The\nintra-connection network is 1Gb Ethernet. One of the ma-\nchines plays the role of master.\nB. Experimental results\nThe most important results achieved from the experiments\nare categorized in the following groups. It is important to\nmention that distributed strong simulation is so slow on\nlarge datasets that we could not run most of the experiments\nwith that particular algorithm; therefore, in a separate set of\nexperiments we compare strong and strict simulation.\nExperiment 1: Running time\nWe examine the running time of the proposed algorithms\nwith different numbers of workers to study their performance\nand scalability \(?gure 6 machine\nbecause of memory limits.\nLike many other systems that are designed for processing\nlarge datasets, the BSP model scales very well on bigger\ndatasets. Moreover, all types of simulation exhibit a ?ltering\nbehavior meaning that they start by processing a large set\nand then re?ne it; this causes light workload at the nal\nsupersteps.\nExperiment 2: Impact of dataset\nIn the ?rst experiment of this group \(?gure 7a the running time of different pattern matching\nmodels to the number of vertices in the data graph As\nexpected, the running time increases with growth in the size\nof data graph. The ratio \(approximately twice between the\nrunning times of graph simulation and dual simulation shows\nthe difference between their computational complexity. The\nincreasing difference between the running times of strict and\ndual simulation can be explained by the fact that the number\nof balls increases proportionally to the number of vertices\nin the result of dual simulation. Figure 7b shows the impact\nof the density of a data graph on running time. An increase\nin running time is to be expected. The unchanged cost of\nball creation \(difference between dual and strict simulation have a big impact on the\ndensity of the dual match graph, the balls do not necessarily\nincrease in size as the density of the data graph increases.\nExperiment 3: Impact of pattern\nFigure 8 shows that running time increases as the size\nof the query becomes bigger, which is not surprising. The\nbehavior remains similar 


across datasets with different num-\nbers of vertices. It can be observed that with an increase in\nthe size of a query, the difference between graph simulation\nand dual simulation increases to a point, but then becomes\nunchanged. This is because, for big queries, it is very likely\nthat the results of graph simulation and dual simulation\nwill be the same. Although the growth in runtime of strict\nsimulation slows at this point its growth with respect to the\ngrowth of dual simulation increases due to an increase in\nball size.\nExperiment 4: Comparison of strong and strict simulation\nThe difference in behavior between the algorithms for\nstrong and strict simulation can be seen in 9. Because of the\nhigh cost of ball creation in distributed strong simulation, it\nwas only possible to test it on fairly small datasets.\nFigures 9a and 9b compare the running time of the two\nalgorithms on two different datasets and a range of query\nsizes. The differences are huge on both datasets, though they\nare small for |Vq| = 10.\nWe also performed a set of experiments to compare the\nquality of the results of strict and strong simulation based\non their closeness to the results of subgraph isomorphism.\nThough strict simulation in comparison to strong simulation\nhas theoretically the same or higher quality in its result,\nin practice our experiments have yet shown no signi?cant\ndifference between them. The closeness value to subgraph\nisomorphism that we found for both strict and strong simu-\nlation is very similar to the value reported in [7].\nFigure 9c shows the total size of the communication in\nthe system per superstep for strong and strict simulation. The\nchart shows three phases for the procedure. The ?rst phase\nis the dual simulation phase that occurs before superstep\n6. Then, ball creation occurs between supersteps 6 and\n19 Supersteps 20 and 21 correspond to processing balls\nand terminating the algorithms; therefore, no communication\nwas observed in these supersteps.\nThere is a difference in communication at the ?rst su-\nperstep because in strong simulation every vertex needs\nto learn about its neighborhood regardless of its matching\nstatus. The exponential increase of communication size in\nstrong simulation during creating balls is because of the\ninvolvement of all vertices in that process. The jagged shape\nof communication is because of our BFS-style algorithm for\ndiscovering balls, which contains requests at one superstep\nand responses at the next.\nFigure 9d displays the difference between the number\n409\n\(a V | = 108, ? = 1.2 b uk-2002-hc \(c simulation \(l = 200, |Vq | = 20 a 1.2 b V | = 108 size and density of G \(|Vq | = 20, l = 200, k = 11 simulation\nwhich indirectly indicates execution overhead of workers.\nAfter the dual simulation phase, though the number of active\nvertices in strict simulation does not experience a signi?cant\nchange, the number of active vertices in strong simulation\nincreases exponentially because inactive vertices become\nactive again during ball creation.\nVI. RELATED WORK\nWe surveyed related work in two categories: pattern\nmatching models and distributed algorithms for pattern\nmatching on massive graphs.\nMany matching models ?nd similarity between graphs\nbased on exact structural matching like subgraph isomor-\nphism and its approximate algorithms. On the other hand,\nsome matching models take into account the meaning of\nattributes of vertices and edges and their relationship in\naddition to graph structure. We are interested in the recent\ntype which is also called semantic graph matching [4].\nA few graph pattern matching models introduced during\nrecent years to ?nd a proper semantic graph match like p-\nhomomorphism [16] and bounded simulation [6]. In [7],\nwhich introduces dual and strong simulation, the idea of\na distributed algorithm is talked about in abstract, but is\nnot based on vertex-centric and thus varies greatly from\nour approach. There are also very interesting theoretical\ninvestigations of different types of simulation presented in\n[14], but it never comes close to a distributed algorithm for\nstrong simulation.\nIn [11] a distributed algorithm only for basic graph\nsimulation is proposed. They have implemented and tested\ntheir algorithm on a cluster of 16 machines; however neither\nthe algorithm nor its implementation is adapted to a widely-\nused cluster computing platform, but it is implemented all\nin Python. To best of our knowledge, our algorithms are the\n?rst distributed algorithms for dual and strong simulation.\nThere are also some proposed approaches based on index-\ning to increase ef?ciency of answering graph pattern match-\ning queries; for example [17] or [18]. However, creating and\nstoring indexes for massive data graphs is not feasible.\nIn [3] a distributed algorithm is introduced for ?nding\nisomorphic subgraph matches in a huge data graph. They\ndeploy graphs on Trinity [19] which is a commercial dis-\ntributed memory cloud environment. To avoid the construc-\ntion time and the storage capacity for complicated indices,\nthey only use a simple string index which maps node labels\nto node IDs. Conceptually similar to our approach, their\nmain idea is based on graph exploration, but they cannot\navoid expensive joins because of the intrinsic limits of\nsubgraph isomorphism.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThis paper discusses the development of \(1 new\ntechnique for graph pattern matching and \(2 techniques.\nThe implementations follow a vertex-centric BSP approach\nwhich has been successful in other areas 


of graph analytics,\nbut has not yet been used successfully in the area of graph\npattern matching. Our new technique for pattern matching,\nstrict simulation, has been shown to scale much better\nthan strong simulation in a vertex-centric framework. In the\nfuture, we will explore the ef?ciency of similar techniques\nfor graph pattern matching when the edges of the query and\ndata graph are also labeled. We will also adapt algorithms\nto use incremental graph pattern matching techniques.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nLakshmish Ramaswamy is partially supported by a grant\nfrom the NSF CSR program.\n410\n\(a V | = 108, ? = 1.2 b c ljournal-2008\nFigure 8.

Changes to lifestyle that eliminates the \nthreats that the hypothalamus/thalamus determines to be a \nthreat \nt nimproving the long-term relationship between the \nsubconscious and conscious mind and understanding how \nthey communicate. \ng thalamus/hypothalamus to \nits pre-damaged condition, must rely on the natural healing \nby the body. \nh Required work to recover: High. The many years of \ndamage to the thalamus and hypothalamus because of nexposure to the harmful chemicals released by the FOFR \nrequires some changes in lifestyle that are often severe for \nmost people to make. Thus, most people will live with \nanxiety and use the medications to relieve relief from the \nsymptoms rather than adopt the right lifestyle their FOFR \ndemands to stop the progression of the mental illness to \neven more severe behavior changes including suicide. \nX. THE SENSORY INPUT TO THE FOFR nThe sources of the known sensory inputs into the fight-or­\nfight response/thalamus are the ears \(sound light pressure/pain odor temperature, \npressure equivalent to a \nchannel of analog information. This means that if the \nanalog input data were converted to digital telemetry, the \nFOFRlthalamus is receiving about 1 00 GB/S of input data \nfrom each channel of information continuously during \nwaking hours. \nThe sensory input to the subconscious and conscious is far nless during sleep and so data processing decreases allowing \nthe brain to slow down and recover from the day's work \nduring sleep. The FOFR and thalamus and hypothalamus \narea of the brain continues to monitor all the data inputs for \nthreats and remains ready to initiate any action necessary for \nself-preservation. \n12 nXI. THE COMMUNICATIONS BANDWIDTH \nBETWEEN THE SUBCONSCIOUS AND THE \nCONSCIOUS \nUsing feelings, hunches and emotions to communicate from \nthe subconscious to the conscious mind, the information \ninput to the conscious mind from the subconscious mind is \nsignificantly less than the sensory input into the FOFR \nsubsystem. The conscious mind would be easily overloaded \nif it received all the information that the FOFR subsystem nreceived from a person's eyes, ears, nervous system and \nskin and nose. \nThe communications capability between the conscious and \nsubconscious mind is close to zero and this is the reason that \nthe external sensory inputs such as ears, eyes and nose, to \nthe subconscious mind must be used to communicate with \nthe subconscious mind by the conscious mind even though \nboth reside in the same brain. It is confusing to understand \nthat the conscious thoughts are not accessible to the \nsubconscious mind, but they are not. Data exists that the \ncommunications between the subconscious and conscious \nmind is one way thus forcing the conscious mind to use the \nsame communication channels that are used by the \nsubconscious for receiving all other information. \nXII. How PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS PROCESS \nINFORMATION FOR PREDICTING MENTAL ILLNESS \nFigure 21 is the prognostic analysis that was completed on \nthree NASA EUVE satellite rate-gyros used for attitude ncontrol, pointing and reorienting of the NASA Extreme \nUltra-Violet Explorer \(EUVE orbiting \nspace science satellite. The behavior in the data in Figure 2 1  \nfor Gyro B was missed by the engineering analysis that was \ncompleted by the gyro vendor's manufacturing engineers. \nThe duration of time that the equipment telemetry spanned \nin the prognostic analysis in Figure 2 1  is equivalent to that \nof a prelaunch readiness, launch and 30  days of on-orbit \nhistory for a human space flight program. The prognostic nanalysis used the NASA EUVE gyro motor current. All \nthree rate-gyros were operating simultaneously for nredundancy purposes, only two gyros were needed \nfunctionally. The NRTE \(accelerated aging nGyro B telemetry motor current was processed using \nproprietary predictive algorithms. [ 16] \nPredictive algorithms demodulate telemetry behavior from \nthe measurements in time, amplitude, frequency and phase. \nThe demodulation process illustrates the presence of non­\nrepeatable changes that are usually overlooked and nmisdiagnosed as systemic noise from completely normal \nappearing and normal behaving people or systems nFigure 2 1 .

WHAT IS A THREAT, STRESS, STRESSORS \nAND TRIGGERS \nThese terms need to be defined because they often used \nincorrectly. A threat to the FOFRIhypothalamus/thalamus is ndefined only by the a person's thalamus/hypothalamus and \nis believed to include such events as a dangerous animal \nready to strike, a person attempting to strike someone, a \nperson with a gun that may fire the gun to cause harm. \nStress is the response of the body when the FOFR is \nactivated when the thalamus/hypothalamus recognizes that a \nthreat as defined by the FOFR is present. Early indicators \nthat the FOFR has been activated include: hay \nfever/allergies, canker sores in and around the mouth and \ntongue, chapped lips heartburn, hemorrhoids \(inflamed \nrectum fellow employees, a bully at school, a failing grade \non a test, an angry fried, deadlines, homework, tests nmidterms and finals. \nTriggers are events, places, people, behavior or items that \nevoke a psychological behavior or reaction. Triggers are \nunique and identified only by a person's \nFOFRIthalamus/hypothalamus as a threat. The body \nresponds with a faster heartbeat, faster breathing, \nperspiration and increased blood pressure as well as \npsychological and/or emotional responses. \nXIV.

The Different Rates of Degradation for the \nBrains Subsystems caused by the Chemicals Released by \nthe FOFR Eventually Resulting in Mental Illness. \nThis different rate of degradation for the brain's subsystems \n\(see Figure 23 released by the FOFR long-term is the basis for \nthe application and usability of the prognostic and health nmanagement program to predict and prevent mental illness. \nAs the brain's subsystems degrade in perfonnance their \nfunctionality changes and this change in functionality is \nillustrated in telemetry, using predictive algorithms in a \nPHM \(see Figure 2 1 detennining if an offset \nor non-repeatable transient event \(a.k.a. accelerated aging personnel on board space exploration missions \nby comparing a person's baseline circadian and ultradian nrhythms behavior and real-time circadian and ultradian \nrhythms. If either or both exists, it means that the nFOFRIthalamus is degraded by the harsh chemicals of the \nFOFR and the thalamus will continue to degrade in nperformance enough to cause mental illness in the near \nfuture. \nPredictive algorithms require information from the inside of \nthe active part of a system. Fortunately, the part of the brain \nthat controls circadian rhythms resides next to the thalamus \nand hypothalamus and the behavior that is controlled by the \ncircadian rhythm proved the information to be processed \nusing predictive algorithms. So when the thalamus and nhypothalamus are damaged from the harsh chemicals from \nthe FOFR, the part of the brain that controls the circadian \nrhythms is also damaged due to its location near the \nthalamus and hypothalamus \(see Figure 25 the damage \nis identifiable by using predictive algorithms to process the \n14  \nmeasurements from the body that experience circadian \nrhythm. \nFigure 25. The Location in the Brain where Circadian \nand Ultranian Rhythms Originate Near the Thalamus \nand Hypothalamus that Create the FOFR that are \nDamaged from Long Term Exposure to Cortisol and \nAdrenaline. \n[191Almost every function in the human body exhibits a \ncircadian rhythm and major changes to these rhythms can be \nused to predict mental illness. In ambulatory conditions nenvironmental factors and physical exertion can obscure or \nenhance the expressed rhythms. The three most commonly \nmonitored vital signs are blood pressure \(systolic and \ndiastolic Because these \nvariables exhibit daily rhythms, their normal values vary \nwith the time of day. \nTable 3 shows the normative ranges for these variables. \nCircadian rhythms are produced by natural factors within \nthe body 


but they are also affected by signals from the \nenvironment. Light is the main cue that triggers circadian nrhythms, and turning light on or turning light off trigger the \ngenes that control an organism's internal clocks. Circadian \nrhythms are physical, mental and behavioral changes that \nfollow an approximate 24-hour cycle, responding primarily \nto the light and darkness in a person's immediate \nenvironment. They are found in people, most living things, \nincluding animals, plants and many tiny microbes. \nCircadian rhythms change sleep-wake cycles, hormone \nrelease, body temperature and other important bodily \nfunctions. Researchers have already identified the genes that \ndirect circadian rhythms in people, fruit flies, mice, fungi \nand several other model organisms. \nCircadian rhythms determine many human behavioral \npatterns.[201 The body's master clock controls the production \nof melatonin, a honnone for sleep. The area of the brain that \ncreates circadian rhythms is located just above the optic \nnerves, which relay infonnation about the incoming light to nthe eyes. When there is less light-like at night-the area \ntells the brain to make more melatonin so a person gets \ndrowsy. Ultradian rhythms are events in the body that are \nrepeated throughout a 24-hour circadian day In contrast, \ninfradian rhythms, are events such as the human menstrual \ncycle, have period longer than a day nTable 3.

A continuum exists from the \nmolecular genetics, through the cellular and neuroendocrine \nto the behavioral and psychosocial levels. The ultradian \nrhythms have far-reaching consequences for our \nunderstanding of human physiological and mental health \nand disease.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
