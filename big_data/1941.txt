INTRODUCTION System-level discrimination performance for missile defense relies on how well data can be associated between participating sensors.  Under the existing architecture, there may be a handover of tracks between a forward based sensor \(e.g., AN/TPY-2\(FB e.g SBX 1 1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1164, Version 5, Updated January 9, 2009 midcourse radar and an interceptor, known as an electronic kill vehicle \(EKV nearest pattern matching \(GNPM Levedahl [6], is a mathematical programming formulation that has proven to be quite successful in both these scenarios at correctly correlating tracks from two sensors while simultaneously removing inter-sensor bias and accounting for false tracks and missed detections. A key assumption of the GNPM formulation is that track states follow a Gaussian distribution, which facilitates computations in algorithms used to solve the GNPM problem. However, when the track state is augmented to include one or more features associated with the track, this assumption becomes tenuous due to the fact that actual feature measurement errors are typically non-Gaussian The focus of this paper is to extend the GNPM formulation to improve correlation performance by properly accounting 


to improve correlation performance by properly accounting for feature observations whose measurement errors follow some arbitrary distribution. This is accomplished by augmenting the GNPM likelihood function to include a term representing the incremental likelihood of track-to-track assignments based solely on feature observations. These feature-based likelihoods can be computed numerically in real-time. At the same time, this augmented likelihood function must also take into consideration the possibility that one or both of the sensors does not observe a particular feature for one or more objects.  We show how this issue can be addressed. We will refer to this extension as the feature-aided GNPM \(FA-GNPM existing GNPM formulation which uses only kinematic data as the metric only GNPM formulation The notion of performing feature-aided track-to-track association, i.e., incorporating feature \(or attribute measurements to improve track correlation, is not new Many researchers in the multi-target tracking community have considered the inclusion of continuous- and discretevalued features [1, 4, 5, 12]. However, there are still a number of open questions concerning how such featureaided associations should be made given realistic data and real-time processing constraints. The main contribution of this paper is to present computational results for a more realistic setting in which feature measurement errors are non-Gaussian 2 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section introduces the GNPM problem and the assumptions needed to perform joint bias estimation and track correlation. Section 3 describes a straightforward extension of the GNPM formulation to make use of feature measurements whose errors follow a Gaussian distribution while Section 4 outlines this extension for a non-Gaussian distribution.  In Section 5, we explain how existing algorithms for the GNPM problem can be modified to solve FA-GNPM problem instances.  Computational results are presented in Section 6 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT Consider two independent sensor systems  sensor A and sensor B  tracking an unknown number of targets in space Due to a host of factors, the number of tracks formed by sensor A and sensor B, denoted nA and nB, respectively, will differ from the true number of targets and from one another Without loss of generality, we assume throughout that A Bn n? . Accompanying each sensor A and B track is a state-covariance pair  for , ,1 Ai n  and , ,1 Bj n  and possibly featurerelated data or statistics.  In particular, iA  and jB  denote kinematic \(also called metric while iP  and jQ  denoted the error covariance matrix of the tracks. We assume that the track states and covariance matrices have been transformed to a common Ddimensional reference frame and are time aligned The GNPM formulation assumes that each track state is corrupted by a constant, but unknown, sensor bias [6, 7, 9 10]. Ideally, these individual sensor biases would be estimated and removed prior to performing track-to-track association, but this is not always possible [2, 8 Consequently, the GNPM formulation attempts to estimate the inter-sensor bias, or the relative bias, between the two sensors via maximum a posteriori \(MAP translational bias b is typically given a prior distribution that is Gaussian with mean 0 and covariance R A track-to-track association hypothesis, denoted by a, is a one-to-one mapping of sensor A tracks to sensor B tracks That is, for each , ,1 Ai n  the notation 1,{ , }Bj n  means that the i th sensor A track is associated with the jth sensor B track. For notational convenience, it is 


with the jth sensor B track. For notational convenience, it is also possible to have 0j =  in which case the ith sensor A track is not associated with any sensor B track The joint a posteriori probability distribution of a relative bias b and a track-to-track association a is given by the GNPM likelihood function   1   1 /2 2   2 1  2 if 2 if T T i a i i a i A i D n T AB D i NTA NTB i eL a eP a i a i           gt     b R b A B b S A B b b R S 1 where constants discussed in [2, 11]. It is often more convenient to work with a modified negative log likelihood function which after some algebra and the removal of unnecessary constants, is given by  1 2  1    if A T n i a i i 


i a i i i NLL a d a i g a i    gt    b b S R bb 2 where 2 1      T i a i i a i i i a id  b A B b S A B b  and 22 log \(2 T AB D NTA NTB Pg    is a so-called log likelihood gate value denoting the cost of a null assignment.  The GNPM problem, also known as the joint MAP bias estimate and track-to-track association problem, is to find the bias estimate b and the track-to-track association a that maximize the GNPM likelihood function 1 likelihood function \(2  mathematical programming formulations for this problem are presented in [3] and [11 The basic idea behind the FA-GNPM formulation is to augment the GNPM likelihood function to further weight bias-association likelihoods using available feature data.  As a result, the summation in Equation \(2  1 2   1    if A T n i a i i i a i fi NLL a d c a i g g a i    gt     Rb b S bb 3 where th sensor A 


th sensor A track being associated with the jth sensor B track, based solely on one or more features and gf is an additional term incurred for making a null assignment. Notice that, in current work, one typically assumes that feature measurements are not corrupted by the unknown bias term that we are also interested in estimating 3 3. FA-GNPM UNDER GAUSSIAN FEATURE MEASUREMENT ERRORS This section outlines how the GNPM formulation can be modified with minimal effort under the assumption that feature measurement errors follow a Gaussian distribution Under these circumstances, the state vectors and covariance matrices are simply augmented to include an additional state for each feature of interest. For example, assume that track state-covariance pairs  transformed to a common 6-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, where iA  and jB  have position and v e l o c i t y  c o m p o n e n t s              x  y  z  x  y  z         T h e n   a  G a u s s i a n  feature estimate can be appended to each state vector so that e a c h  s t a t e  v e c t o r  t a k e s  t h e  f o r m                x  y  z  x  y  z  f       Similarly, iP  and jQ , which were originally 6 6   covariance matrices, become 7 7  matrices. Feature measurements may or may not be correlated with other kinematic estimates.  Furthermore, this augmentation allows for a bias to be present in the additional feature dimensions The gate value is changed accordingly For a glimpse at the benefits of feature-aided track-to-track association and the metrics used to evaluate performance some preliminary test results follow. A common scenario of interest will be maintained for consistency.  Sensors A and B will both observe a common scene and form five tracks from their observations.  Through joint variation of the number of true targets in the scene and the probability of track for each sensor, the number of common tracks between the sensors, i.e., tracks originating from the same true target, will range from 1 to 5.  The number of common tracks is also referred to as the track overlap Two metrics will be presented to quantify association performance of the various formulations. The first is the probability of correct association \(PCA number of sensor A tracks that are correctly associated, with a 1 for a correct association and a 0 for an incorrect association.  The total is divided by the number of sensor A tracks \(nA objects.  Here only sensor A tracks which have a sensor B counterpart are included in the scoring Figure 1 demonstrates performance enhancements of FAGNPM over GNPM for two features with Gaussian measurement errors, one with a significantly smaller error variance than the other.  PCA is plotted against the nearest neighbor Mahalanobis distance \(NN/1 proportional to the scene density.  Feature measurements take on values over the normalized interval [0,1] with a standard deviation of 0.1 \(Figure 1 Figure 2 Even with a relatively low feature quality \(defined as 1/?f where ?f is the feature error standard deviation in the probability of correct association can be obtained.

This result is due to the scoring metric.  In the case of high density and small overlap between the two sensors, the GNPM formulation is likely to say that an optimal track-to-track association hypothesis is the  all zero  association hypothesis in which no tracks are assigned; no other association hypothesis yields a GNPM hypothesis likelihood greater than the one in which all sensor A tracks being unassociated.  Given a single track in common between the two sensors, the  all 4 zero  association hypothesis results in a PCA of 0.8.  As the tracks begin to disperse, sensor A tracks are associated with sensor B tracks and a decrease in PCA occurs 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 180 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 NN/1 PC A PCA for Tracks in Common

FA-GNPM UNDER NON-GAUSSIAN FEATURE MEASUREMENT ERRORS In the previous section, feature measurement errors were assumed to be Gaussian.  However, from studying realistic feature measurement algorithms, it is clear that actual estimation routines are likely to be highly non-Gaussian To understand the consequences of modeling feature measurements as Gaussian random variables, when, in reality, they are not, we begin this section by exploring what happens to the joint MAP bias estimate and track-to-track association hypothesis when actual feature estimate errors follow a bi-modal distribution.  The true feature value is uniformly distributed over [5, 20] and the estimate is distributed between two Gaussians, one centered and the true value and the second at two times the true value with each Gaussian having a standard deviation of 0.25, as shown in Figure 5, with 70% of the weight of the distribution is centered around the true value 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 180 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 x

Here we consider a scenario where sensors A and B observe the same five objects \(perfect overlap feature truth is uniformly distributed over [5, 20] for all objects.  The feature measurements are sampled from the bimodal PDF as in Figure 5 Figure 6 shows FA-GNPM performance for this nonGaussian feature measurement error. For a dense scene resulting in a poor metric correlation, FA-GNPM can achieve a greater probability of correct association with the correct choice of error variance. The optimal choice of ?f achieves an increase in PCA from 0.31 to 0.50. By considering this same scenario, but allowing track times to increase, we obtain a more dispersed scene \(Figure 7 5 same estimate of ?f is applied, the PCA significantly degrades from the metric correlation. As ?f is increased the FA-GNPM result eventually approaches GNPM, but never exceeds it  Figure 6  Gaussian FA-GNPM for a bi-modal feature measurement error   Figure 7  Gaussian FA-GNPM performance in a disperse metric scene with bi-modal feature measurement error  Feature Likelihoods for Non-Gaussian Measurement Errors In order to examine how performance improves if the Gaussian assumption is removed, feature likelihoods are calculated separately from the likelihoods used in the metric only GNPM likelihood function \(1 here is to solve for feature likelihoods in a maximum a posteriori framework [12].  It is initially assumed that perfect a priori knowledge of the feature measurement error distributions are known and feature truth is uniformly distributed over the interval [fL, fH].   For each object, there is a single underlying feature truth value x from which sensors A and B form observations fiA  and f jB respectively.  To maximize the likelihood that sensor A track i and sensor B track a\(i object, we compute the likelihood surface       where likelihoods   calculated using Bayes  rule, e.g      Pr Pr Pr Pr f if f i i f i  A x x A x x A A L 


L The likelihood surface, L , for the bi-modal feature estimation error is shown in Figure 8.  The main peak extending around the ff i a i=A B  line is the likelihood surface resulting from a Gaussian assumption as presented in Section 3.  By allowing the a priori estimate of the feature to deviate from this assumption, two additional areas provide high likelihood estimates corresponding to when sensor A measures twice or half of the value as sensor B When a Gaussian prior is used to form the likelihoods, these measured feature pairs would lead to a low likelihood due to their relatively large distances in feature space Ai f B a\(i  f Log10\(Aif,Ba\(i   0 10 20 30 40 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0  Figure 8  Likelihood surface for the given feature estimate distribution 5. NON-GAUSSIAN FA-GNPM IMPLEMENTATION Only unbiased feature measurements which are independent from their metric states will be considered, allowing the metric and feature likelihoods to be calculated independently without loss of generality 6 The scenario generation node constructs state vectors and covariance matrices from sensor measurements.  Once they are passed to the metric/feature fusion node, feature information is stripped and only metric data is passed to an algorithm, known as GNPP, that solves instances of the GNPM problem. For our scenarios, GNPP returns NBEST association hypotheses, bias estimates and log-likelihood ratios, where NBEST is the maximum number of possible association hypotheses for the problem of interest.  GNPP returns an association matrix a of dimension \(NBEST  nA along with their corresponding log-likelihood ratios.  The metric/feature likelihood fusion node will send all possible association hypotheses \(the matrix a corresponding log-likelihood ratios for metric states LLRm f jB , for all , ,1 Ai n  and , ,1 Bj n  to the feature likelihood computation engine.  As an input this node takes the precomputed likelihood surface L , based on a priori 


computed likelihood surface L , based on a priori information of feature measurement errors.  Feature loglikelihoods LLf, are computed for the NBEST association hypotheses where the metric/feature likelihood computation engine forms a complete log-likelihood ratio based on both metric and feature data and the hypothesis with the best score is returned for performance evaluation 6. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS The framework in Section 5 was implemented and the likelihoods shown in Figure 5 were used to evaluate performance.  First, the two metric scenes from Section 4 are considered.  Figure 9 shows performance of the nonGaussian prototype compared to metric and Gaussian FAGNPM formulations  Figure 9  Performance improvement of Non-Gaussian FA-GNPM for a dense metric scene  Figure 10 - Performance improvement of Non-Gaussian FA-GNPM for a dispersed metric scene The results here indicate that an improvement over the previously presented Gaussian FA-GNPM result can be achieved when the feature measurement error is characterized correctly.  For the dense metric scene a performance improvement from 0.31 to 0.89 is obtained This is significantly greater than the Gaussian FA-GNPP result with the optimal choice of error variance producing a PCA equal to 0.51.  Likewise, for the dispersed metric scene \(Figure 10 FA-GNPP does not lead to association performance below GNPP 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 180 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 NN/1 PC A PCA for Tracks in Common   1 overlap 2 overlap 3 overlap 4 overlap 5 overlap  Figure 11 - Performance improvement of Non-Gaussian FA-GNPM \(dotted solid feature measurement error The analysis is continued for the 5 on 5 metric scene over all possible track overlaps and nearest neighbor Mahalanobis distances ranging from 0.5 to 20 \(Figure 11 The results verify that with accurate characterization of feature measurement error, Non-Gaussian FA-GNPM performs well above GNPM for a wide range of scene densities and common tracks between the two sensors 7 7. SUMMARY The results in Section 6 indicate that when feature estimation error is well understood, non-Gaussian FAGNPM shows a significant performance improvement over metric only GNPM.  The alternate approach of attempting to characterize non-Gaussian feature measurement error 


distributions with a single Gaussian produces small performance gains over metric only GNPM for complex feature measurement errors.  Conversely, even as the quality of the a priori estimate of the feature measurement distribution degrades with non-Gaussian FA-GNPM performance is well above metric only GNPM These preliminary results are an initial step towards achieving performance improvement of track-to-track correlation for a handover scenario by augmenting metric data with feature measurements.  Synthetic data was used to demonstrate a proof-of-concept capability.  Issues such as how well features can be extracted from a closely spaced object scene were not addressed here.  Future plans include utilizing measured data to further explore the problem.  In this paper, we have shown improvement when accurate knowledge of the estimation error is present.  Techniques to mitigate the effect from incorrect feature measurement error characterization need to be further studied to be effective in a fielded system REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and H.
