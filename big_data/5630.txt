This is a reason of diffi culties to obtain accurate characterization despite of vari ety of techniques available. This report is devoted to the selectio n of proper waveguide method for specific cases of bulk or film materials investigation to obtain reliable data of their and tan  I  I NTRODUCTION  Main difference of ferroelect rics and related materials is their large dielectric constant 10 2 
226 10 4 metimes, this high is accompanied with big loss factor \(tan 0.01 \226 1 Related materials with tan 10 3 with 10 2 are also available, and quite different methods should be used to characterize them High materials are important for numerous applications in microwave components such as dielectric resonators 
dielectric substrates, decoupling capacitors, absorbent materials, phase shifters, etc Ferroelectrics are important obj ect in solid state physics as well because of their phase transitions. Lattice dynamics theory predicts strong anomalies in ferroelectric properties just at the microwaves. Ferroel ectric domain switching in thin films also takes place at microwaves. Therefore, accurate and reliable measuring of dielectric constant and loss in ferroelectrics and related materials remains an actual problem of material science as we ll as electronic industry Main microwave methods used for high 
materials study are classified in Fig. 1. At present, methods for microwave measurement of usual dielectrics with of about 2\226100 and low loss are well developed. Some of them use vector network  so me studies dedicated to ferr  Neve rthel e ss, this technique should be improved now using the vast possibilities of present-day microwave network analyzers Because of high permittivity, microwave measuring of ferroelectrics faces difficu lties. Open systems such as microstrip line suffer from approximations, while coaxial line 
is inconvenient to make ceramics or crystal samples of cylinder or disk form In some ferroelectric crystals dielectric properties are strongly anisotropic, and require investigation in the onedirectional electric field The major problem of high dielectric microwave study is a poor interaction of electromagnetic wave with studied specimen Due to the difference in the wave impedance, most part of electromagnetic energy reflects  from air-dielectric boundary and can not penetrate the specimen. That is why, short 
circuited waveguide method exhibit lack of sensitivity. If the loss of dielectric is also big, the sample of a few millimeters length looks like \223endless\224. For the same reason, in the transmission experiment, only a small part of electromagnetic Fig 1. Microwave methods of ferroelectrics` study   978-1-4244-2688-1/08/$25.00 \2512008 IEEE

Ho wever, reliable and accurate measurement of ferroelectric materials with extremely high permittivity and loss still remains an actual problem   Fig. 2.

Then, for the convenience, the network transmission matrices can be converted into scattering ma trices whose parameters are measured directly   Fig. 3. Measured data and processing. 1.51mm BaTiO 3 with 6.56mm teflon transformer, reflection experiment  Proper choice of weight is a function important for correct data processing. Among possible ways, there are weighted derivatives, and the modulus of reflection or transmission coefficients. These methods emphasize the influence of points near the minimum values of the reflection or transmission which just exactly have the highest sensitivity to properties of studied material The choice between short-circ uited line or transmission reflection methods depends on which method has better sensitivity, and should be applied individually Three common and easily available materials were used for experimental study \(Table I\. Samples were prepared in the rectangular shape that is adjusted to X-band waveguide cross section.

Introduced conception of partial filling of waveguide with studied material facilitates the examination of expensive or rare materials when big sample is difficult to prepare III  D IFFERENT METHODS OF FERROELECTRIC FILMS STUDY  Deposited on a substrate large ferroelectric film is one of microwave material of increasing technical interest. Such film is very promising for applications in the monolithic microwave integrated circuits \226 MMIC. Ferroelectric films are applied as by-pass on-chip capacitors, voltage tunable capacitors [3 freq u e n c y ag ile reso n a n t  filters 4 m i cro w av e phase shifters for steerable antenna  The calculation and design of mentioned devices need an exact value of the film parameters and tan obviously measured at microwaves. In-p rocess measurement of film dielectric parameters is important for experimental specification during film deposition and annealing The accurate measurement of fe rroelectric films dielectric properties is an actual problem for material science as well. A comparison of bulk-to-film change properties is an interesting question of ferroelectric physics. Ferroelectrics are highly sensitive to any influence. It is important to learn about what is changed when bulk ferroelectric crystal \(that is a threedimensional, 3-D\sforme d into a thin crystalline layer 2-D film\ous studies of ferroelectric films at low frequencies describe mostly ferroelectric domains and impurities behavior, while microwave investigation should characterize crystal lattice prope rties. So ferroelectric film  and tan parameters, obtained at microwaves, reflect fundamental polariza tion mechanism [6 Considerable change in bulk-to-film abilities could be either favorable or an adverse factor for microwave electronic devices. Good example is a ferroelectric solid solution of Ba,Sr\O 3 BST that is the most studied material for 


  MRRS-2008 Symposium Proceedings. Kiev, Ukraine, September 22-24, 2008  microwave applications. Tunability in film is weaker than in bulk ceramic. However, lucky for many microwave devices BST film dielectric permittivity film 10 2 10 3 any times less than dielectric constant of ceramics 10 3 10 4  that is very important for device matching with the microwave line. Temperature dependence of film is much smoothed comparing to bulk ceramics that provides more thermal stability of film based device [7  The problem is that ferr oelectric film microwave properties are difficult to measur e due to its large dielectric permittivity and very small thic kness. Moreover, ferroelectric film dielectric permittivity might be anisotropic parameter \(it is a second rank tensor\Its normal component n may be as greater so lesser than in-plane component  Many methods of ferroelectric film investigation at radiofrequencies and microwaves are possible [1 El a b o r at ed  methods can be divided on two groups: with and without electrodes, Fig. 2 A parallel plate miniature capacitor is formed with electrodes deposition and can be used to determine n 9 whereas a planar capacitor is suitable to measure 4 By similar way, the microstrip transmission line can be used to find the normal component n whereas coplanar transmission line allows to get tangential component Fig. 4 Without electrodes, employ ing microwave microscope 11 it is po ssi b l e t o esti m a te  n but only in a very little local area of the film. By scanning the average data might be obtained. Such data are required to study film imperfections However, the integral parameter of a whole film might be quite different form local valu es of dielectric permittivity Microwave devices mostly use in-plane component  Consequently, in-process of measurement of integral \(whole film\eters is important for experimental specification during film depositio n and annealing. Therefore film laboratory test should be a non-destructive one. In this case the same film, preliminarily studied at the microwaves might be used for device fabrication Microwave methods of ferroelectric film investigations are exam 8 wh ile r e v iew 9] car r ied  o u t th e analysis of films parameters obtained at microwaves. There are only solitary mentions as to electrode-less study of ferroelectric film. These data relates to a polycrystalline film only. Firstly, by the quasi-optical method, in the frequency range of 300-600 GHz, obtained by sol-gel technology, ~4 m thickness polycrystalline BaTiO3 and BST films, deposited onto MgO ceramic substrate, were investigated [6 nd ly polycrystalline ~1 m sol-gel SrTiO 3 film, deposited onto silica, was studied by the resonant cavity method near the frequency of 10 GHz [8   As to the epitaxial film \(that has the largest interest in MMIC applications\practically no contact-less measurements are reported. It is remarkable that listed in the review [9 all   published experimental data regarding to the epitaxial ferroelectric film are drawn with the use of electrodes. Using electrodes, it is difficult to distinguish between the loss in the film itself and loss in the metal/film interface The opposite-electrodes method, for instance, is employed to study system r e 0.1 m BST film is obtained by the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition Dielectric constant is not notified but too low tan 0.006 looks like an evidence that ferr oelectric properties of studied film are suppressed Sandwich configuration of electrodes is used for miniature SrTiO3 capacitors microwav e study in [1 O n l y  a capacitance but no data on diel ectric permittivity is reported because strong influence of elect rode onto film loss tangent is difficult to estimate Microwave investigation of mi crostrip line with the BST film situated between Pt and Ag electrodes shows  200 50 12  bu t au thors are no t ab le to d e term in e d ielectric lo ss d u e  to a large attenuation of microwave signal by metallic electrodes As it is shown in Fig. 2, electrode-less film is possible to obtain by the resonant methods 1 3   In bot h cases  t h e opened microwave systems are us ed for measurements that makes difficult to provide st rict electrodynamics analysis Moreover, ferroelectric film might have big loss \(on some stages of its deposition or a nnealing\reduce accuracy of resonant methods Common techniques for studying dielectric materials in the waveguide usually rely on the measurement of complex scattering parameters of the waveguide which is filled with Fig 4.

However, such an approach faces obvious difficulties with thin films. Simple estimation shows that 1 m thick film with 1000 and tan 0.05 placed in the X-band waveguide cross section induces phase perturbation of only about 0.4 and brings attenuation of about 0.002 dB. These values are obviously out of equipment resolution capabilities An additional complication is th at the electrodes, as a rule should be the multi-layered ones to provide good adhesion to film. Usually employed pre-coat is titanium \(or chromium that has much higher resistan ce than the upper gold electrode Due to this reason, and because of very thin skin-layer, and electrode roughness, it is difficult to take proper account of the skin effect influence onto measured film tan  As a rule, epitaxial ferroel ectric film parameters are studied in the design of plan ar capacitor, with the use of interdigital electrodes deposited onto the opened surface of the film deposited onto dielectric substrate [3 is m e th o d  film parameters usually are obtained at the frequency of about 1 MHz, and next this informati on is applied to the microwave device elaboration. This assumption is not good grounded because of ferroelectrics show strong frequency dispersion in their dielectric properties Ferroelectric film placed between coplanar electrodes were investigated at microwaves as well, [5  1 2 an d 1 3 F i l m  parameters can be extracted from complex impedance of investigated phase shifter, whic h is a coplanar line. However any opened system is characteri zed by the radiation loss that has to be taken into account. This way of measurements usis rather complicated opened system, in which microwave propagation has to be assigned to three dielectrics: film itself substrate under film, and air above film, while electrodes influence should be considered as well That is why, as in case th at planar capacitor so for coplanar line, the calculation of dielectric permittivity and especially loss tangent looks quite approximate. Moreover, in the most of metering methods, mentioned in the review [9 microwave and tan of a \223natural film\224 remain unknown because a complex system of \223electrode-film electrode\224 with substrate and radiation influence are investigated To improve film deposition technology as well as to elaborate calculated microw ave device based on film parameters, \223natural film\224 electr ical properties are urgent, just before electrode deposition, and, certainly, at microwaves IV  N ON RESONANT METHOD OF FILM INVESTIGATION  To force microwave to propagate along film, the metallic electrodes are usually used. However, ferroelectric-metal interface\222s loss shades film\222s natural properties. Film surface metallization should be avoided because it characterizes mainly the interface loss. Another problem is strong anisotropy of thin films caused by surface stress. That is why field orientation during measurement should correspond its operation conditions in the MMIC   Fig. 5. Schematic representation of experiment   To improve film deposition technology as well as to elaborate device based on this film, its intrinsic electrical properties are urgent just before the electrode deposition, and certainly at microwaves. Moreover, accurate and reliable measuring of ferroelectric film s dielectric properties is an actual problem not only of electronic industry but for material science as well Taking into account all above mentioned, it is proposed to arrange film-on-substrate \223sandwich\224 along the waveguide as shown on Fig. 5. An important advantage of proposed scheme is the arrangement of measurem ent object in the area of the most strong electric field, that is in the center of waveguide for the basic mode. If film is arranged along the waveguide the interaction is performed on the whole length of the sample Waveguide is a closed system thus there is no radiation loss Like for the bulk material study, the frequency dependence of scattering parameters should be investigated here also Depending on sensitivity, the transmission in the 2-port system or the reflection in a shorted waveguide should be investigated. In both cases, complex transmission or reflection coefficient decreases according to film loss in the \223sandwich\224 while wavelength shortens acco rding to film permittivity To estimate the value of parameter and its sensitivity to the film\222s influence, a theoretical analysis was performed. Using a longitudinal wave representation, electromagnetic field problem was reduced to the nonlinear equation on propagation constant  cotatan  cotatan  tan tan       f f f ff s s s ss f f fss s d a d a d a d a a a 2 2 2 2 2 2  where  s  f 227 transverse wave numbers that can be found as 22  k  alone refers to the non-filled part of waveguide, where 1 d s 227 substrate thickness d f 227 film thickness Given equation was solved numerically to obtain the  propagation constant, which then was used to calculate the reflection coefficient using the transmission matrices approach  for the 2-port system, a tran smission coefficient has to be  calculated as well\. As a reference point, a 0.25mm substrate with S 10 was chosen, while film dielectric constant is supposed to be 1000 The second reference measurement was performed with pure MgO substrate \(without film\is measurement makes

For 20mm long 0.92mm thick MgO substrate we got permittivity 9.99 and loss tan 0.005. Relatively high loss caused by quality of metallization   Fig. 6. Thin film measurement processing The main experiment was with 0.8 m BST film deposited by laser ablation technique onto the 0.92mm MgO substrate Fig. 10 a,b illustrates measured data processing. It is seen note a very good agreement of simu lations with measurements especially in the Re/Im notati on.

In the paraelectric film \(used for tuned devices microwave loss is much lower than  that in the ferroelectric one, and microwave absorption of paraelectric is derived from the damping of soft lattice vibration mode as well from polar phase fluctuations above the Curie point \(polar clusters Partial filling of the waveguide section by a specimen is considered, so the proposed t echnique can be adapted to a small specimen study if big one is not available One of important application of waveguide partial filling is ferroelectric thin film study by the electrode-less technique Proposed microwave method of film investigation does not require electrodes deposition, so film dielectric constant  and film loss n be obtained and compared at various stages of film processing Microwave data are very sensitive to ferroelectric film properties because this film shows dielectric dispersion of  conditioned by the domain wall vibrations just at microwaves It means that domain switching possibility is tied with microwave and Namely, while film processing, the appearance of capable for switching ferroelectric domains corresponds to th e microwave loss  maximum V  R ESONANT METHODS FOR FILM STUDY  Nowadays technologies gradually go to deposit very thin films. At this, film permittivity decreases. Both causes make microwave metering more difficult: film 500 and thickness t 1 m change signal phase as substrate with 50 and t 500 m. Ordinary now film with 100 and t 0.1 m on the same substrate changes transparent microwave signal phase 50 times less than a substrate. Therefore, the thinner film, the less sensitivity will be for the non-resonant methods That is why we proposed and studied two resonant methods to investigate ferroelectric films in a waveguide In first resonant method film on substrate was inserted into thin longitudinal slot in the wide wall of rectangular waveguide [1  Usi n g Net w o r k Anal y s e r a res o nance o f  partially fold part of waveguide was studied and analysed [16  The quality factor and resona nt frequency were used to calculate film loss and Fig. 7.

  MRRS-2008 Symposium Proceedings. Kiev, Ukraine, September 22-24, 2008  However, in the case of thin DR use two effects can increase method sensitivity. First of all, the resonance of free substrate \(without film\ ve ry high quality, because as a substrate very low loss dielectric is used \(such as sapphire or magnesium oxide with tan 10 4 ubstrate should be relatively thin \(might be 50\226200 m\ to increase film influence to resonant frequency 0 and quality factor Q    Fig. 9. Square substrate with film in a waveguide; a little angle need to be used to excite resonances   Fig. 10.  Several resonances are exited fo r thin inclined DR used for thin DR measurements TE 01 mode is higher than \223parasite\224 HE111 mode. Mixed modes HEM cannot be used for calculations  Resonance with film is compar ed with resonance of empty substrate, and from the frequency change the film is extracted while film loss is obtained from the change in Q The problem need to be overcome is unusually very thin and low DR study. Many resonant modes appear in this system but the TE 01 has to be used for and loss calculations Problem of modes separation was solved as by calculation so by the experiments, Fig.10. In thinner substrate frequency resolution of modes becomes better. Different oblique angle DR arrangement in a waveguide was studied as well VI  C ONCLUSIONS  The goal of the report is to compare different methods of ferroelectric bulk and film mate rials microwave study in order to select appropriate method for any concrete situation of investigation          Presented research improves common techniques of ferroelectric and related di electric materials microwave examination in such a way that makes it possible to measure both high dielectric constant and loss R EFERENCES 1  J.

Clustering selects detection primitives and centroiding combines clustered primitive data into a measurement.  The model presented here makes certain assumptions about the process that created the detection primitives.  For example, the model assumes a rectangular shaped ambiguity function cut and an exact c 2 f BW sampling interval.  Even with this simple detection model, closel y-spaced targets, false alarms and missed detections, clustering can be a challenge The simple model of clustering used for the simulated results first thresholds detection primitives based on the observed SNR R o culated by \(24\ to a threshold 27 Detectio n p r im itiv es th at rem ain  are clu s tered  an d  centroided based the number of consecutive range-cell indices occupied.  The simple clustering model considers three cases: a detection primitive with no range-cell-index neighbors, a pair of detecti on primitives with no neighbors except each other, and three or more consecutive range-cell indices.  These three cluster classes are shown in Figure 6 where they are named isolated pair, and CSO, respectively Centroiding treats each of th ese three cases differently Isolated Pair CSO Isolated Pair CSO  Figure 6 - Cluster cases For isolated clusters, the assumption of no additional information is used to produce a centroided measurement with values identical to the detection primitive.  Intuition about the uncertainty of an isolated cell seems to be at odds with this approach.  For example, if the SNR is high, the likelihood of the target being near the center of the range cell should also be high.  Th e assumption of no additional information seems to hold only when the cell\222s SNR is low and close to the detection threshold.  It turns out that 2 3 k D  can be used to examine algorith ms for the isolated-cell case and one of the examples looks at this problem CSO clusters violate the model assumption that target energy will spread to at most two consecutive range cells Thus, the cluster must contai n two or more closely-spaced targets or one target and a false alarm.  CSO clusters produce the same number of measurements as the number of detection primitives in the cluster and use values identical to the corresponding detection primitives.  Measurements from a CSO cluster are flagge d so that the tracker can differentiate between measurements from single-target clusters and CSO clusters.  Different rules govern how these measurements are used by th e tracker.  For example, the tracker may be allowed to in itiate and update a so-called CSO track with a CSO-cluster measurement but it may not be allowed to update a non-CSO track with a CSO-cluster measurement For pair clusters, the data in both detection primitives are used to produce a single centroided measurement and measurement variance.  The centroided measurement is simply the SNR weighted centroid of the two detection primitives expressed by \(27   1 2,,2,1,,1 2,,2,1,1 2,2,1,1 2,1     10            12 2 1 2 1  2 1 2 1  2 1 2 1      212 212 212  r r r r r r r+\r  adpy,oadp,yo adp,xoadp,,xo adp,oadp,o oo amy amx am k k k k R R k k R 27 27 The centroided variance is more involved because the same instrumentation noise is used for all detection primitives Subtracting the instrumentation noise variances from the antenna-relative detection primitives results in the same beam-relative variances used in \(26\roided standard deviations are calculated in \(28\Finally, \(29 adds in the instrumentation noise  r+\r r r r+\r r r r+\r r r  2,1 2 1 2,1 2 1 2,1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1    2 oo ko ko oo ko ko oo ko ko k k R bdp,y bdp,y bdp,x bdp,x bdpx bdp,x bmy bmx bm  resykyi resxkxi resRi k k R k k R kn kn Rn bdp,y bdp,x bdp adp,y adp,x adp  resykyi resxkxi resRi k k R k k R kn kn Rn bmy bmx bm amy amx am   Ukn Ukn URn k k R k k R resykyi resxkxi resRi bdp,y bdp,x bdp adp,y adp,x adp 25   2  2  2  2  22  2 2 2 2 2 2     t t t t t t t t t 28   2  2  2  2  22  2 2 2 2 2 2       t t t t t t 29 29\ield values for apparent truth and apparent clustered and centroided measurements relative to the antenna and supports the calculation of 2 3 k D

Some of these investigations were inspired by algorithm errors detected a nd correct with this technique Other investigations are open ended in that they point out places where further algorithm improvements are needed The results presented in the examples only consider random effects that vary from pulse to pulse or dwell to dwell.  If covariance consistency cannot be obtained at this scale, then there is little hope of getting it right over an ensemble of Monte Carlo trials The scenario used in the examples consists of an ESR Xband radar tracking an incoming ballistic target.  The target range relative to the radar varies from ~380 km to ~25 km The target\222s RCS is large enough so that waveform control maintains an SNR close to the goal SNR of 25 dB.  The target\222s mean RCS and percent scintillation changes as the aspect angle varies from ~50\260 to ~0.6\260 over its trajectory The sine-space azimuth is n early constant varying from 0.70 to ~0.56 at apogee to ~0 66.  The sine-space elevation varies over a wider range from ~-0.40 to ~0.11 at apogee to 0.07.  Under these conditions tracking error is fairly small so that the target is track ed near beam center.  One exception to beam-center track ing occurs in the first example where different values for beam-steering offsets are added on purpose Targets Away from Beam Center Consider the difference in Fi gure 7 between measurements that occur on or near beam center where the monopulse response is approximately linear versus measurements that occur closer to the edge where the monopulse response is curved.  The monopulse response transforms uncertainty in y I into uncertainty in DOA Near beam center a Gaussian uncertainty in y I results in a Gaussian uncertainty in DOA Closer to the edge, the monopulse response distorts y I 222s uncertainty so that the DOA\222s un certainty is both biased and no longer Gaussi  Unless some compensation is applied, it is expected that the covariance consistency will be better near the beam\222s center compared to the edge.  Indeed, plots of consistency versus distance from beam center in Fi gure 8 match expectations The order of plots from top to bottom and the legend order are the same.  A value equal to 1 is consistent while a value greater than 1 implies that th e reported covariance is smaller than the uncertainty in the data.  To generate these curves constant beam-point offsets of 0, 1%, 5%, 10%, and 12.5 of the 3dB beamwidth were added to the elevation direction of the nominal beam point.  A sliding window of 50 points was used to calculate the average 2 1 k D values plotted in the curves     On Beam Center Gaussian Gaussian Gaussian Non-Gaussian and Biased Off Beam Center y I DOA     On Beam Center Gaussian Gaussian Gaussian Non-Gaussian and Biased Off Beam Center y I DOA  Figure 7 - Measurements on the monopulse curve One notable feature of Figure 8 is the sensitivity.

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
