A Logic of Attribute Containment Radim Belohlavek State University of New York at Binghamton Binghamton NY 13902 and Palacky University Olomouc 779 00 Olomouc Czech Republic Jan Konecny State University of New York at Binghamton Binghamton NY 13902 Abstract We present a logic of if-then rules such as if all attributes of an object are among those from A then they are among those from B  The attributes can either be yes/no attributes such as male and has all wheel drive or graded attributes such as red and good performance which apply to objects to certain grades We assume an abstract nonnumeric framework in which the grades form a particular bounded partially ordered set equipped with aggregation operators For such framework we provide basic syntactic and semantic notions describe complete non-redundant sets of the if-then rules and a logic for reasoning with such dependencies with its ordinary-style and graded-style completeness 1 Introduction 1.1 Problem setting Logical calculi for reasoning about binary yes-or-no attributes are one of the thoroughly studied areas which play a foundational role for acquisition elicitation and modeling of knowledge Various aspects such as extraction of various types of formulas from data or devising syntacticosemantically complete systems of deduction rules have been intensively studied in the past Particular attention has been paid to various types of if-then rules see e.g for logic of binary attributes and its connection to functional dependencies and 5 for description and algorithms for e xtraction of the smallest complete set of if-then dependencies from binary data for an o v ervie w of association rules  for related logical calculi and 11 for some what for gotten but a rather deep treatment of data dependencies of which association rules are a particular example Most of the previous work was done in the framework of binary attributes In practice numerous attributes are graded fuzzy rather than binary The present paper develops foundations of reasoning about data which contains graded fuzzy attributes i.e for attributes such as red or good performance which apply to objects to degrees The paper is a continuation of our previous work see e.g for an o v ervie w 3 for computational aspects In this paper we present a general logical calculus of if-then rules A  B for graded attributes which read if all attributes of an object are contained in A then they are contained in B  We assume that the scale of grades to which attributes apply to objects form a particular partially ordered set bounded by 0 and 1 equipped with truth functions of many-valued logical connectives An example of such scale is the unit interval 0   or a two-element chain f 0  1 g  but we neither assume numerical character of the grades nor that the grades are linearly ordered If 0 and 1 are the only grades our framework becomes a logic of containment of binary attributes For this framework we introduce basic syntactic and semantic notions covering two basic meanings of containment of graded attributes Section 2 describe complete non-redundant sets of if-then rules Section 3 and a logic for reasoning with such dependencies with its ordinarystyle and graded-style completeness Section 4 Due to the limited scope we omit proofs or include just sketches The next section provides preliminaries 1.2 Preliminaries We use complete residuated lattices as our structures of grades truth degrees These structures are well-known in mathematical fuzzy logic 2 8 to which we refer for further properties A reader familiar with these notions may skip this section A complete residuated lattice with a truth-stressing hedge shortly a hedge is an algebra L  h L   _  012    003  0  1 i such that h L   _  0  1 i is a complete lattice with 0 and 1 being the least and greatest ele

4 Completeness theorems In this section we introduce an axiomatic system for our logic and prove completeness theorems First we introduce deduction rules and a notion of a proof from a set T of FAIs Second we prove that A  B is provable from a set T of FAIs iff A  B semantically follows from T in degree 1 ordinary completeness Third we introduce a concept of a degree j A  B j  T of provability of A  B from a fuzzy set T of FAIs and show that j A  B j  T  jj A  B jj  T graded completeness 4.1 Deduction rules Our axiomatic system consists of the following deduction rules  Ax infer A  A  B  DCut from A  B and B  C  D infer A  C  D  Sh from A  B infer c 003  A  c 003  B for each A B C D 2 L Y  and c 2 L  Rules Sh are to be understood as usual deduction rules having FAIs which are of the form of FAIs in the input part the part preceding infer of a rule a rule allows us to infer in one step the corresponding FAI in the output part the part following infer of a rule Ax is a nullary rule axiom which says that each A  A  B  A B 2 L Y  is inferred in one step Rules Sh resemble Armstrong rules from database theory Remark 1 If 003 is globalization Sh can be omitted Indeed for c  1  we have c 003  1 and Sh becomes from A  B infer A  B  which is a trivial rule for c  1  we have c 003  0 and Sh becomes from A  B infer Y  Y  which can be omitted since Y  Y can be inferred by Ax A  B is called provable from a set T of FAIs using a set R of deduction rules written T  R A  B  if there is a sequence  1       n of fuzzy attribute implications such that  n is A  B and for each  i we either have  i 2 T or  i is inferred in one step from some of the preceding formulas i.e  1       i 000 1  using some deduction rule from R  If R consists of Sh we say just provable     instead of provable    using R  and write just T  A  B instead of T  R A  B  A deduction rule from  1       n infer     i   are fuzzy attribute implications is said to be derivable from a set R of deduction rules if f  1       n g  R   Again if R consists of Sh we omit R  We omit the proof of the next lemma Lemma 16 The following deduction rules are derivable from Ax and DCut Ref infer A  A  Wea from A  B infer A  C  B  Add from A  B and A  C infer A  B  C  Pro from A  B  C infer A  B  Tra from A  B and B  C infer A  C  for each A B C D 2 L Y  4.2 Ordinary completeness In this section we show that deduction rules Sh are sound and we prove their completeness A deduction rule from  1       n infer   is said to be sound if for each M 2 Mod f  1       n g  we have M 2 Mod f  g   i.e each model of all of  1       n is also a model of   The following lemmas are needed to prove our completeness theorems The proofs are technically involved and we omit them due to lack of space Lemma 17 Each of the deduction rules Sh is sound A set T of FAIs is called semantically closed if jj A  B jj  T  1 iff A  B 2 T  i.e if T  f A  B j jj A  B jj  T  1 g  syntactically closed if T  A  B iff A  B 2 T  i.e if T  f A  B j T  A  B g  The following lemma is almost immediate Lemma 18 A set T of fuzzy attribute implications is syntactically closed iff we have Ax A  A  B 2 T  DCut if A  B 2 T and B  C  D 2 T then A  C  D 2 T  Sh if A  B 2 T then c 003  A  c 003  B 2 T for each A B C D 2 L Y  and c 2 L  Lemma 19 Let T be a set of fuzzy attribute implications If T is semantically closed then T is syntactically closed Lemma 20 Let T be a set of fuzzy attribute implications let both Y and L be 002nite If T is syntactically closed then T is semantically closed Corollary 21 If L and Y are 002nite a set T of FAI T is syntactically closed iff T is semantically closed Theorem 22 ordinary completeness Let L and Y be 002nite Let T be a set of fuzzy attribute implications Then T  A  B iff jj A  B jj  T  1

Proof Sketch Denote by syn  T  the least syntactically closed set of fuzzy attribute implications which contains T  It can be shown that syn  T   f A  B j T  A  B g  Furthermore denote by sem  T  the least semantically closed set of fuzzy attribute implications which contains T  It can be shown that sem  T   f A  B j jj A  B jj  T  1 g  To prove the claim we need to show syn  T   sem  T   As syn  T  is syntactically closed it is also semantically closed by Corollary 21 which means sem  syn  T  022 syn  T   Therefore by T 022 syn  T  we get sem  T  022 sem  syn  T  022 syn  T   In a similar manner we get syn  T  022 sem  T   showing syn  T   sem  T   The proof is complete 003 4.3 Graded completeness We now turn to a graded version of the completeness theorem Note that Theorem 22 can be read as providing a syntactic characterization of entailment in degree 1  i.e of jj A  B jj  T  1  However entailment comes in degrees in general jj A  B jj  T is a degree not necessarily equal to 0 or 1  Our aim is to capture jj A  B jj  T syntactically For this purpose we introduce a notion of a degree j A  B j  T of provability of A  B from a fuzzy set T of FAIs Then we show that j A  B j  T  jj A  B jj  T  which can be understood as a graded completeness completeness in degrees Note that graded completeness was introduced by Pavelka see e.g 7 for detailed information For a fuzzy set T of FAIs and for A  B we de\002ne a degree j A  B j  T 2 L to which A  B is provable from T by j A  B j T  W f c 2 L j c T   A  c 012 B g  17 where c T  is de\002ned as in Lemma 5 This makes use of the reduction of general entailment from fuzzy sets of FAIs to entailment in degree 1 from crisp sets of FAIs established in Corollary 7 The we get Theorem 23 graded completeness Let L and Y be 002nite Then for every fuzzy set T of fuzzy attribute implications and A  B we have j A  B j  T  jj A  B jj  T  5 Further issues We provided several results regarding a logic of attribute containment for graded attributes Main results established in the paper are a description of non-redundant bases of data tables with fuzzy attributes and completeness theorems for such logic We omitted several issues which we plan to include in the full version Most importantly model-theoretic results related to an ef\002cient checking of entailment computation of non-redundant bases and illustrative as well as real-world examples References  S Abiteboul et al  The Lowell database research self-assessment Communications of ACM  48 pp 111118 2005  R Belohla v ek Fuzzy Relational Systems Foundations and Principles  New York Kluwer 2002  R Belohla v ek V  Vychodil Fuzzy attrib ute implications computing non-redundant bases using maximal independent sets in AI 2005 Arti\002cial Intelligence  S Zhang and R Jarvis Eds LNAI  3809 Berlin Springer-Verlag pp 11261129 2005  R Belohla v ek V  Vychodil  Attrib ute implications in a fuzzy setting in ICFCA 2006 International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis  R Missaoui and J Schmid Eds LNAI  3874 Berlin Springer-Verlag pp 4560 2006  B Ganter  R W ille Formal Concept Analysis Mathematical Foundations  Berlin Springer 1999  G Geor gescu A Popescu Non-dual fuzzy connections Archive for Mathematical Logic  43 pp 1009 1039 2004  G Gerla Fuzzy Logic Mathematical Tools for Approximate Reasoning  Dordrecht Kluwer 2001  J A Goguen The logic of ine xact concepts Synthese  18 pp 325373 1968  J.-L Guigues V  Duquenne F amilles minimales d'implications informatives resultant d'un tableau de donn  ees binaires Math Sci Humaines  95 pp 518 1986  P  H  ajek Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic  Dordrecht Kluwer 1998  P  H  ajek T Havr  anek Mechanizing Hypotheses Formation Mathematical Foundations for a General Theory  Berlin Springer 1978  D Maier  The Theory of Relational Databases  Rockville Computer Science Press 1983  J Rauch Logic of association rules Applied Intelligence  22 pp 928 2005  C Zhang C S Zhang Association Rule Mining Models and Algorithms  Berlin Springer-Verlag 2002

Time Complexity and Speed We now evaluate scalability and speed with large high dimensional data sets to only compute the models as shown in Figure 7 The plotted times include the time to store models on disk but exclude the time to mine frequent itemsets We experimentally prove 1 Time complexity to compute models is linear on data set size 2 Sparse vector and matrix computations yield efÞcient algorithms whose accuracy was studied before 3 Dimensionality has minimal impact on speed assuming average transaction size T is small Transactions are clu stered with Incremental Kmeans 26 introduced on Sectio n 3 Large transaction les were created with the IBM synthetic data generator 3 ha ving defaults n 1 M T=10 I=4 Figure 7 shows time complexity to compute the clustering model The rst plot on the left shows time growth to build the clustering with a data set with one million records T10I4D1M As can be seen times grow linearly as n increases highlighting the algorithms efÞciency On the other hand notice d has marginal impact on time when it is increased 10-fold on both models due to optimized sparse matrix computations The second plot on the right in Figure 7 shows time complexity to compute clustering models increasing k on T10I4D100k Remember k is the main parameter to control support estimation accuracy In a similar manner to the previous experiments times are plotted for two high dimensionalities d  100 and d 1  000 As can be seen time complexity is linear on k  whereas time is practically independent from d  Therefore our methods are competitive both on accuracy and time performance 4.5 Summary The clustering model provides several advantages It is a descriptive model of the data set It enables support estimation and it can be processed in main memory It requires the user to specify the number of clusters as main input parameter but it does not require support thresholds More importantly clusters can help discovering long itemsets appearing at very low support levels We now discuss accuracy In general the number of clusters is the most important model characteristic to improve accuracy A higher number of clusters generally produces tighter bounds and therefore more accurate support estimations The clustering model quality has a direct relationship to support estimation error We introduced a parameter to improve accuracy wh en mining frequent itemsets from the model this parameter eliminate spurious itemsets unlikely to be frequent The clustering model is reasonably accurate on a wide spectrum of support values but accuracy decreases as support decreases We conclude with a summary on time complexity and efÞciency When the clustering model is available it is a signiÞcantly faster mechanis m than the A-priori algorithm to search for

constrained frequent itemset search are NP-hard and they are at least P-hard meaning t hey will remain intractable even if P=NP This work gives evidence it is not a good idea to mine all frequent itemsets above a support threshold since the output size is combinatorial In 13 t h e a ut hors d eri v e a bound on the number of candidate itemsets given the current set of frequent itemsets when using a level-wise algorithm Covers and bases 37 21 a re an alternati v e t o s ummarize association rules using a comb inatorial approach instead of a model Clusters have some resemblance to bases in the sense that each cluster can be used to derive all subsets from a maximal itemset The model represents an approximate cover for all potential associations We now discuss closely related work on establishing relationships between association rules and other data mining techniques Preliminary results on using clusters to get lower and upper bounds for support is given in 27  I n g eneral there is a tradeoff between rules with high support and rules with high conÞdence 33 t h i s w o rk propos es an al gorithm that mines the best rules under a Bayesian model There has been work on clustering transactions from itemsets 41  H o w e v er  t hi s a pproach goes i n t he oppos i t e di rection it rst mines associations and from them tries to get clusters Clustering association rules rather than transactions once they are mined is analyzed in 22  T he out put is a summary of association rules The approach is different from ours since this proposal works with the original data set whereas ours produces a model of the data set In 42 the idea of mining frequent itemsets with error tolerance is introduced This approach is related to ours since the error is somewhat similar to the bounds we propose Their algorithm can be used as a means to cluster transactions or perform estimation of query selectivity In 39 t he aut hors explore the idea of building approximate models for associations to see how they change over time 6 Conclusions This article proposed to use clusters on binary data sets to bound and estimate association rule support and conÞdence The sufÞcient statistics for clustering binary data are simpler than those required for numeric data sets and consist only of the sum of binary points transactions Each cluster represents a long itemset from which shorter itemsets can be easily derived The clustering model on high dimensional binary data sets is computed with efÞcient operations on sparse matrices skipping zeroes We rst presented lower and upper bounds on support whose average estimates actual support Model-based support metrics obey the well-known downward closure property Experiments measured accuracy focusing on relative error in support estimations and efÞciency with real and synthetic data sets A clustering model is accurate to estimate support when using a sufÞciently high number of clusters When the number of clusters increases accuracy increases On the other hand as the minimum support threshold decreases accuracy also decreases but at a different rate depending on the data set The error on support estimation slowly increases as itemset length increases The model is fairly accurate to discover a large set of frequent itemsets at multiple support levels Clustering is faster than A-priori to mine frequent itemsets without considering the time to compute the model Adding the time to compute the model clustering is slower than Apriori at high support levels but faster at low support levels The clustering model can be built in linear time on data size Sparse matrix operations enable fast computation with high dimensional transaction data sets There exist important research issues We want to analytically understand the relationship between the clustering model and the error on support estimation We need to determine an optimal number of clusters given a maximum error level Correlation analysis and PCA represent a next step after the clustering model but the challenges are updating much larger matrices and dealing with numerical issues We plan to incorporate constraints based on domain knowledge into the search process Our algorithm can be optimized to discover and periodically refresh a set of association rules on streaming data sets References 1 C  A ggar w al and P  Y u F
