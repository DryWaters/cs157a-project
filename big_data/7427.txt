Without it, the IPv4 protocol\222s limited number of available addresses would be pushed to its limits. However, NAT poses a big problem for security and especially for networks protected by intrusion 
detection systems \(IDS\and intrusion prevention systems \(IPS The paper underlines the NAT\222s implications on IDS and IPS and proposes a solution that includes the NAT technique in this security infrastructure  Keywords 227 Network Address Translation, Intrusion Detection Systems, Intrusion Prevention Systems I  INTRODUCTION Internet is one of the fastest growing communication mediums ever. It is estimated that several thousand new hosts are connected every day. However, the vast growth rate had caused considerable problem, due to the fact that Intemet transport version 4 protocol \(IPv4\ not provide enough 
addresses for all the new hosts in its infrastructure. To resolve this limitation, the IANA \(Internet Assigned Number Authority\ has defined a set of IP addresses as private addresses \(non Internet-routable\be used freely in any intranet. But since these addresses are non Internet-routable IP addresses, a Network Address Translation \(NAT\nique is mandatory to interconnect a local network to Internet. In fact NAT assigns public addresses \(routable IP addresses\ to packets sent from private LAN. Generally, it operates on a router between a private network and outside \(Internet\and does a one-to-one or a many-to-one IP address translation There are also three NAT techniques: traditional NAT modifies the source addresses, Twice NAT modifies both the 
source and destination addresses for packets, and NAPT Network Address Port Translation\modifies the address and the port source. Without NAT, the IPv4 address space would have been exhausted a long time ago. However, the translation of address/port by NAT affects different other applications since applications behind the NAT have no way to know what the real address/port used by the hosts a m ple, t h e translation of the address/port in a packet across the NAT breaks mechanisms such as IPSec which verify the integrity of packets over network since the packet is modified. In [1 Shieh el al state \223By breaking the end to-end nature of Internet applications, NAT threatens Internet security\224. In this paper we are interested by the security implications of NAT in 
network protected by Intrusions Detection Systems \(IDS\ and Intrusions prevention Systems \(IPS\In fact, it is a problem for IDS and IPS to work with NAT since the host information IP address and port number\fected by NAT. If the IDS detects a suspicious incoming packet, the alert generated will contain the public IP address as victim\222s identifier; so the security operator cannot determine who is the really victim since all the incoming packets have the same destination IP address. If the IDS detects a suspicious outgoing packet, the alerts will contain the public IP address as attacker\222s identifier So, the security operator cannot identify the real attacker since all the outgoing packets contain the same public address as source IP address. Another problem is that NAT does not 
permit to extricate profit from the alerts correlation technique since the alerts have the same source or destination IP address Another problem is that if we have an IDS deployed below the NAT and another above the NAT, these two systems will refer the same occurrence of attack with different victim and attacker\222s identifiers whereas they mention the same entities and the same attack. The problem of NAT is more far serious in context of IPS. If the IPS assumes an incoming packet as malicious, it can block the traffic to the victim. But this action will cause self-inflicted denial of service to all the users in our private network since the IP address of the victim is common for all the others hosts. If it blocks the source address, no one 
from the entire remote network can reach our system; if this remote network is also managed by NAT. If the IPS assumes an outgoing packet as malicious, the IPS\222s active response can block the attacker. However this action will block the entire network since all the outgoing packets contains the same address IP source Although the NAT technology provides network benefits there are also a number of security problems that remain to be solved. So, in order to address these problems, the paper develops a solution that solves the NAT\222s security issues in local area network protected by IDS and IPS systems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follow. Related works 
are presented in section 2. Section 3 describes our IDS/IPS architecture. We present in section 4 the detail of the identification module. Section 5 illustrates the evaluation of the solution. Finally, in the last section we summarize the paper and outline future work II  R ELATED WORK  Network Address Translation is been the focus of much debate in the networks security community.

In fact, STUNT is defined as a global naming policy to make the server behind the NAT identifiable to Internet clients so that the clients can actively initiate connections to the server. Besides, STUNT does not modify communication data so that end-to-end security mechanisms can be guaranteed. Yuji et al os e a D y n a m i c P r oces s  Resolution Protocol \(DPRP\ that can traverse NAT and by which devices in the network learn changes in system configurations automatically, and maintain communication groups. NAT poses also a problem for the Internet Protocol Security \(IPSec\which is an increasingly popular way to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data while it\222s in transit over an IP network. The problem is that NAT changes the IP address of the internal computer to that of the NAT device. The Internet Key Exchange \(IKE\sed by IPSec embeds the sending computer\222s IP address in its payload, and this embedded address doesn\222t match the source address of the IKE packet \(which is that of the NAT device When these addresses don\222t match, the receiving computer will drop the packet. The IPSec working group of the IEEE has created standards for NAT-T that are defined in RFCs 3947 d R F C s 3948 [4 N A T T i s des i gn ed t o s o l v e t h e problems inherent in using IPSec with NAT. However Microsoft recently revealed that the way IPSec and NAT-T work can cause a security threat wherein IPSec traffic intended for one computer may be routed to the wrong computer, if certain criteria exist. These comments show that despite that NAT mitigates the problem of IPv4 address depletion in today's Internet; it poses problems for network security. So, existing security solutions must be re-examined in order to function correctly within the network environment  III  SOLVING THE NAT PROBLEM ON IPS AND IDS  To resolve this problem, we suggest that the IDS/IPS deployed in the network must be aware about the presence of a NAT device that changes the packets headers. So, we propose a new architecture of IDS/IPS that respects and integrates this network characteristic in its analysis process in order to correctly identify the entities implicated in security issues and take the best decision based on what is appropriate to these entities. Networks deployed NAT, IDS or IPS can be illustrated as in figure 1. This figure presents also our new IDS/IPS architecture which is composed of three components receiver module, analysis module and identification module   Receiver module: it collects network data and forwards the traffic to the analysis module  Analysis module: it analyses traffic to look for malicious or suspicious intents. The output of the analysis module is an alert composed of four attributes attacker  victim  attack and time The field attack identifies the malicious action. The field attacker identifies the entity source of attack The field victim  designs the entity destination of attack and the field time  determines when attack is detected. However, in the first hand, the alert generated does not identify the real hosts implicated in the security issue. In the second hand, if there are two IDSs/IPSs systems, one deployed above the NAT and another below the NAT, so these two systems will refer attacker and victim with different identities even if they alert the same attack, so these two alerts will be considered as two different alarms which increases the number of alerts and overwhelm the security operator. These requirements underline the need to add another module in the IDS/IPS architecture  Identification module: the out put of the analysis module is send to the identification module which determines the real hosts\222 identities that are implicated in the security issue based on the NAT table.  Once, the real hosts are identified, the IDS send an alert to the security operator with the appropriate information, so the operator can take the best decision based on the properties of these hosts. In case of IPS, the active response is applied only on the  concerned host, so neither the entire private network nor the entire remote network is involved  IV  IDENTIFICATION MODULE  Before explaining our identification module, we adopt the following NAT characteristics  NAPT: both the source addresses and ports are modified   NAT device INTERNET IDS/IPS Private N etwor k   Receiver module Identification module Analysis module Private Adress source  Port source Public Adress IP Assigned Port number NAT Table 2 


  Dynamic NAT: the mapping between private and public addresses and ports is not configured manually but dynamically by the NAT device. In fact, dynamic NAT is useful when the network topology changes frequently  Many-to-one IP address translation:  we suppose that the number of available public addresses in a network is N P The different private hosts can be divided into several sets.  The number N S of these sets should be inferior or equal to N P  The NAT device attributes for all the private hosts in each set S j 1 j N S a public address PA i 1 i N P  It is important to note that the identification module accesses to the information from only the local NAT but not remote NAT deployed in others private networks. In fact allowing local NAT information to others devices can have security implications since an attacker can access this information and use it maliciously There are two possible IPS/ID S\222s errors according to the traffic direction  Case 1: a suspicious outgoing packet \(figure 2 In this case, the address source is changed to the public address and the port source to the assigned port. So, the IDS/IPS cannot determine the malicious internal user\222s identity and the port number that initiates the intrusive connection since this information is hidden by the NAT device. As discussed in section 1, the IDS/IPS  reaction can have serious consequences on our network  Figure 2. case 1- suspicious outgoing packet  Figure 3. case 2- suspicious incoming packet   Case 2: a suspicious incoming packet \(figure 3 In this case, the IDS/IPS cannot determine the internal user\222s victim of the attack since the address destination contains a public address and the port destination is different from the port chosen by the private host. In this case, the reaction of the IDS/IPS  can have serious consequences on the network availability. In addition, identifying the real victim is helpful to be aware about the vulnerable hosts in our system since attacks are generally generated against hosts presenting vulnerabilities To resolve these problems, we propose that the identification module identifies not only the hosts implicated in the security issue but also the malicious connections. In fact, the identification module process is based on two phases During the initialisation phase, the identification module builds an 3 is completely identified by the 4-tuple a is the port destination  Definition 2 node N s  a D s  D  s D s  D We define the relation k k {1, 2} be two k  identities-graph figure 4, to discover the hosts\222 properties in the private network. As shown in figure 4 the identification module starts by sorting the public IP addresses in a linked list called Public-adr-chain Each node in Public-adr-chain contains a public address PA i 1 i N P and leads to a set of connections sharing PA i as a source or destination IP address \(in order to take into account the both traffic\222s directions\ fact, this set, called PA i tree is defined as an acyclic direct graph where each node PA i 1 i N P and the assigned port number AP k  V  k 0 AP k  1024}. In fact since the NAT device assigns different port numbers for connections initiated from private hosts AP k serves as an identifier of a node in PA i tree So, the couple PA i  identities-graph In addition, each node PA i tree contains a structure called P-Info containing information about the private address P r A, which initiates the connection and the initial port number IP, chosen by the private host. In fact, one host can initiates several simultaneous connections behind different ports numbers. All these ports are changed by the NAT to different port numbers AP k and each AP k will generate the creation of a new node. This permits to follow the connection and to differentiate between the intrusive connections and the legitimate ones within the same host  Figure 4 identities-graph   we define the relation PA i tree  V 1 i N P  C 1  205\205      D p s p  002 tre tree  AP 1  C 1  C 2  C 2      NAT router N etwork INTERNET IDS/IPS Suspicious packet NAT router N etwork INTERNET Suspicious packet IDS/IPS to express equality between two nodes Definition 4 \(relations   Let N C on N C is the IP Address source  2  a is presented as a couple Identities-graph structure  Definition 1 connection   N C is the IP Address destination  3  p we use a total order  C N C C P k P 1  P 1  A node corresponding to a connection PA  To order C     N C 2  iff    N C 2  iff A connection 2   Public-adr-chain  PA N P  is a Public Address IP assigned by the Nat device  is a decimal value, superior or equal to 1024 assigned by the Nat device For suitably organizing 002 between a connection C and a 002  Let 002 as N C In addition, we introduce the relation  A is the port source  4  p N P where 1    P e  1  1  a N j  V  j 0, represents a connection that is completely identified by the public address N in PA i tree  1 i N P as follow Definition 3 \(relation  AP 2  AP 1  AP 2 AP k  serves as a key of a connection in PA,AP PA AP C a connection, N C its corresponding node and T a PA i tree 1 i N P We denote by AS  C a AD C a PA i tree iff AS=PA i  or AD=PA i node in PA i tree  V 1 i N P We denote by AP We define the relations < and = as N C 1 P 2 N C 1 P 2   PA 1   PA 2  205\205 205

When a host initiates a connection the identification module needs to create a new node with the corresponding assigned port number and the couple \(private address, initial port\d when it puts an end to a connection our identification module should destroy the connection\222s node. This involves communication between the identification module and the NAT device. So, to update the identities-graph we start by defining a data structure graph update figure 5\This structure is exchanged between the identification module and the NAT device. As shown in figure 5 graph update contains a set of attributes identifying a connection: private address, port, public address and assigned port. When the NAT device effectuates a new modification in its table, it creates an instance of graph update with the appropriate information. In fact, it uses the different methods Set to can modify the values of the different attributes; after it sends this data structure to the identification module that can extract the needed information thanks to the different methods Get and updates the identities-graph To determine if the identification module should create or destroy a node, it consults the graph update   Attributes identities-graph The identification module starts by extracting from the alert the attacker and the victim IP addresses and verifying which of these addresses correspond to a PA i  address, 1 i N P In fact, if there is a match with the attacker, this corresponds to case 1 \(figure 2\d if there is a match with the victim, this corresponds to case 2 \(figure 3 Once, the PA i  address is found, the identification module goes over the linked list Public-adr-chain to find the corresponding node that leads to the appropriate PA i tree  After, to determine the real private host \(attacker or victim implicated into the security issue, the identification module is based on the port number assigned by the NAT device. So, it extracts from the alert the port source if PA i corresponds to the attacker\222s address and the port destination if PA i  corresponds to the victim\222s address. If the port number is determined, the identification module browses PA i tree to find the corresponding node. Once we reach the correct node we extract \(P r A, IP\ally, in case of IDS, our identification module constructs a new alert with the real values of address and port. In case of IPS, we can take the adequate active response action against the real address and port. So in both case, only the implicated host is concerned and the others hosts continue running normally V  E XPERIMENTAL RESULT  In order to validate the efficacy of our IDS/IPS system, we develop a test environment. We generate different TCP streams including FTP, HTTP, ICMP and different other types of traffic. We use several tools as ARP0c, APsend and Hunt permitting the simulation of attacks. We deploy our NAT device on a Cisco router \(model 2501, category 2500, RIP as routing algorithm\. We use 3 public addresses to access to the internet and each public address is shared between 8 hosts. In fact, in our test environment we use 3 PC and beside each one we create 8 virtual hosts using the vconfig utility. On each virtual interface, we attribute a private IP address. In fact private virtual hosts from 10.0.1.1 to 10.0.1.8 shared the public address 193.95.66.10 private addresses from 10.0.1.9 to 10.0.1.16 shared the public address 10.0.1.17  to 10.0.1.24 shared the public address 193.95.66.12  We chose the host 10.0.1.9 to run a HTTP server and we use the port forwarding technique in order to be accessible from out side. To deploy an IDS, we use Snort and to deploy an IPS, we use Snort-inline In both cases, we add the identification module and we implement the whole on a PC equipped with Intel Pentium 4 \(2 GB of RAM\ning Linux Redhat. The communication between the identification module and the Nat device is based on J2EE platform  The identification module implements Java RMI to invocate the remote object Java RMI can provoke a certain burden of response time during the initialisation phase. Our identification module presents a linear time complexity. Indeed, let Ai be a public address d the size of Public-adr-chain  Ni the dimension of graph update data structure  During the operational phase, the identification module confronts the alert generated by the analysis module with the Connection_state attribute that indicates if it is a new connection \(create a new node\e end of a connection \(destroy a node 193.95.66.11 and private addresses from graph update  The main goal of the first experiment is measuring the identification module\222s time taken to process packets. In this experiment, we are interested only by the operational phase\222time. But it is important to note that A i tree  Besides, we use o to compute a public address and int to compute a port number. Then the worse search time is

In this scenario, H 1 uses NMAP to detect whether FTP service is running on target hosts  Result  During the experiment, we observe that in scenario 1 \(figure 6 snort generates an alert with 193.95.66.10  as IP address of attacker and 2356 as port source; but this address corresponds to a router\222s extern interface. Whereas our IPS/IDS architecture does the correspondence between the two address 193.95.66.10 and 10.0.1.2 the two port numbers \(assigned port 2356 and 5987 nd formulates an alert with the appropriate value   Figure 6. Experimental result of scenario 1   Scenario 2 DoS attack launched by a remote host against our web server in order to interrupt the HTTP service running on the host \223 10.0.1.9 224. In this scenario, we emulate a DoS attack using an snort is incapable to determine the victim since its alert specifies 193.95.66.11  as victim\222s identifier. However, our identification module successfully determines that the attack is directed to the host 10.0.1.9 running the web server   Scenario 3 Attack using worm launched against different private hosts  Result In scenario 3 \(figure 8\e remark that not only snort but also our IPS/IDS architecture failed to identify the victims. In fact, this failure is not due to the identification module\222s performance decrease but due to the absence of the connections\222 characteristic in the NAT table. When a remote host launches connections containing worm, the NAT router cannot determine the target host since the port/address and their assigned values are undefined in the NAT table and the destination address in packet header corresponds to its interface address. In this case, the object graph update cannot be constructed. This scenario underlines the need to use not only IPS/IDS system but different security devices as antivirus and firewall in order to form a global security layer   Figure 8. Experimental result of scenario 3 VI  C ONCLUSION  NAT provide a way to handle IP address depletion incrementally. However, IDS/IPS must be re-examined to function correctly within NAT. In this paper, we have fully integrated the NAT\222s modification done on packets headers within the IDS/IPS analysis process in order to correctly identify the entities implicated in security issues. Our experiments have shown that utilizing a NAT-aware IDS/IPS system permits to identify the real attacker/victim, launch the adequate response actions with respect to the attacker/victim characteristics and improve the protection of the network Future work will include more interest at finding relationships among alerts generated by IDS/IPS systems deployed below and above the NAT device R EFERENCES  1  Shiuh-Pyng Shieh, Fu-Shen Ho, Yu-Lun Huang, And Jia-Ning Luo 223Network Address Translators: Effects on Security Protocols and Applications in the TCP/IP Stack\224.

The next step of this study is to develop a fault tolerant control algorithm in or der to automatically adjust the input of the drilling proce ss in case of bit dysfunction detection.

hospital is an example of a service that might be of interest to visitors as well Exercise tips is an example of a dynamic information object that can take parameters from a CitiScape and return specific information depending on the context of the CitiScape.  Here, different exercise information will be presented, depending on the role of the CitiScape, which in turn depends on the role of the user.  The time facet may be used to determine in which situations or times information is available; for instance, in case of a health emergency, users visiting any of the health CitiScapes may be redirected to a CitiScape dealing specifically with emergency services and information.  Thus, for example, the items from the table above could be dynamically assembled into the identified CitiScapes in Figure 4.  These CitiScapes cater to the interests of different users based on their context of interaction    Figure 4: Example CitiScapes associated with Health  4. Application Benefits of CitiScapes Architecture  In this section we explore the more strategic benefits of the CitiScape architecture further  Business Intelligence Mining  CitiScape architecture realizes that the knowledge of the services that the user needs is available only partially with the user while the Government itself holds a lot of that knowledge.   Hence, a symbiotic interaction is facilitated by CitiScapes between the user and the Government.  With every step in the interaction, the user reveals more of his interest and context of interaction and the system narrows these services and pushes them to the user.  The interaction sequence could be also monitored as follows 1  A user enters the system through a general CitiScape providing value for location and time  2  When a user is identified as a citizen, the system knows that the user could be interested in spaces like Citizen Finding Healthcare, Citizen Emergency, Citizen Staying Healthy, but they could also be interested in other spaces like job opportunities, community events, filing taxes etc They could even be interested in more specific spaces like Senior Health or Family Health.  This provides intelligence on populations and in certain areas  3  If the user indicates interest in finding healthcare the system narrows down the services that it will push to the user. So, the focus now will be on spaces related to healthcare as opposed to spaces related to employment or taxes, for example.  The user may then access an item like general exercise tips or finding a doctor.  Thus, the spaces of Citizen, Staying Healthy, Citizen Finding Healthcare and Citizen Emergency will be relevant for this level of interaction.  Now we have a significant understanding of the users interests The user may choose to stop at this level if their need has been met, or he may continue interacting with the system to get more services.  This type of telescoping can provide significant understanding of trends within populations as well 4  Next if this user is a senior citizen, they could enter the CitiScape for senior citizens and now access additional items or even view the same items from the perspective of a senior citizen.  So if they want to look at exercise tips, they could find those specific to senior citizens in this CitiScape.  They would also be able to find other information such as nutrition, common ailments and access services such as participation in community events for senior citizens.  They could access a general service like finding the nearest doctor or hospital but could also access a specific service such as finding a doctor specializing arthritis, since they are now a part of the Senior Health CitiScape.  Thus, they are now looking at not only those services that they initially thought they wanted, but also related services in which they would now be interested, even if they weren t aware of them initially.  Again, this provides insights into new needs   In summary, this sequence illustrates several aspects 1\he user has an intuitive and progressive interaction with the system that provides needed services, 2\e sharing and reuse of items like exercise tips across spaces and in contexts that are both general \(as in the Citizen Staying Healthy CitiScape\r more specific \(as in the Senior or Family Health CitiScapes\d finally, 3\ the dynamic population of the spaces based on citizen interaction to provides significant intelligence Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


Dynamically enhanced navigation and user experience In a traditionally organized website, the citizen might begin at the city homepage, and traverse links through a structure that is often organized by department.  We can think of the CitiScape architecture and navigation path as a continual narrowing down of the user s intent until the user arrives at a place where they can complete their intended interaction.  However, even this generalization is optimistic for many government web presences which have become cluttered and disorganized due to the rapid increase in demand for online services and the lack of time and/or experience necessary to keep all of the information contained in a web presence accurate, timely and organized.  In addition, the internal organization structure \(e.g departments\ is not an appropriate structure for navigability.   For instance, given a certain service need, how would a citizen know whether his or her request should go to the Public Service or the Public Safety department?  As shown in the previous section CitiScapes addresses these issues by providing views of services relevant to users, their roles and interests and the additional facets that account for their individual context for using the system  Improved reuse and searchability  The overall approach used at all levels is to dynamically populate the CitiScapes and the items within them with content.  The content objects themselves are all maintained in a self-contained and local fashion and used whenever and wherever they meet the criteria.  This occurs not only when populating the CitiScapes but also when developing content.  To illustrate the point, suppose a content provider role needed to add a new news story to Getting Health Care In the proposed layered CitiScapes architecture, the news story would be a specific independently maintained object with a collection of attributes, such as Title, Author, Date Created, Date of Expiration, Summary, Body, and Subject, along with additional attributes to define its position in an underlying taxonomy and its applicability to various CitiScapes.   Instead of creating all of the attributes values uniquely, the content role will have the opportunity to select from existing objects as values for attributes of the news story object Selecting an object and content that most likely already exists in the system enforces reuse of the existing information, avoids duplication, and specifies a dynamic relationship between the two objects Getting health care and news story.  Next a query can be easily constructed to find any news story releases related to a given subject Moving to such a dynamic approach also allows us to take advantage of semantic querying.  For example logic and ontology languages such as RDF and OWL can be used to express relationships between objects and facilitate flexible queries and searches, as well as inference  Improved services The role facet allows great flexibility of user access to objects in a CitiScape-based system.  It supports the integration of various services using data from the enterprise directory and CMS-based user registration as well as profiles gathered from user behavior and online transaction activity As the users in different roles narrow their intent by navigating and providing values for the different facets that the CitiScapes are built on; the system pulls appropriate service items based on accumulated knowledge about the particular user.  For instance, if there exists some profile or cookie information indicating that the given user has used the website many times to find information on public parks, the system might direct them to a CitiScape having a focus on parks or outdoor activities.  If we know that the user is a citizen of the city, the system will direct them to a citizen-centered CitiScape, as opposed to directing a visitor to a visitor-centered CitiScape. This two-way interaction will help us identify those services that are used often and in what context, those that are not used and even what CitiScapes are effective.  Thus the information can help the government strategically to develop services that are more specific to the citizens  Service Use and IT Traceability A CitiScapes implementation improves the ability to collect and mine relevant information about how when, and where services and information are used For example, we can now track for each object which CitiScapes are being used to access it, and thereby know which user groups and roles are associated with its use.  Combining this information with traditional web presence metrics such as length of time spent viewing information or completing a service navigation patterns, and frequency of access will allow more user-centric performance data to be gathered Deriving patterns from these observations will allow the government organization to truly understand the needs and habits of the citizenry, and incrementally improve the services and information it provides Additionally, we will be able to provide business-IT traceability, because we also know which back-end system each object is residing in, and therefore track the usage of these systems in order to provide better analysis of technology use  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


5  Conclusions  Structuring an eGovernment system around the concept of CitiScapes will provide significant benefits to users of the system as well as administrators and stakeholders.  The dynamic population of CitiScapes presents users with services chosen to match their roles and needs, thereby affording the opportunity to push  highly relevant services to a user in addition to retrieving information to satisfy a given need, while ensuring trustworthiness and security by only providing services that the user can access based on their role.  The organization of services by relevant facets gives users easy access to needed services without having to understand how the government organization is structured.  The support for underlying information objects and relationships provided by the CMS allows the connection to be made between the different dimensions of the portal environment; it is now possible to keep track of when, where, how and by whom services are being used, and gather this information to provide performance feedback to the system for future improvement. In addition, the reusability of information and service objects across multiple CitiScapes increases maintainability of the web presence by centralizing the change process away from pages toward services.  Finally, we envision that eventually the support for CitiScape-type features will be incorporated into CMS systems to enable better socio-technical interactions   6.

  11 to request, review, and propose changes to the current state of the science plan Distributed Operations 227 Cassini distributed all aspects of the instrument operations to the science teams. Science Teams were required to develop the spacecraft commanding for pointing the spacecraft. Th is significantly complicated the interfaces and coordination required by the JPL science and sequencing teams. The distribution of internal instrument commanding and monitoring instrument health and safety worked well. Dedicated full-time operations personnel were required at all instrument sites. The liaison between the distributed sites and JPL required definition of a strong JPL Investigation Scientist \(i.e., Experiment Representative\le Distributed operations is a two-edged sword. Scientists personally worked operations and were better able to optimize for their science objectives. Their insight provided the feedback necessary to quickly respond to science discoveries in the science selection and uplink processes This allowed the operations team to capitalize on truly extraordinary opportunities to a degree not thought possible However, this was at the cost of doing science analysis and publishing science results Software Development 227 The Cassini mission deferred most of its ground software development until post launch. In fact, considerable effort was spent accelerating the development of the tools required to plan the Jupiter flyby observations in 2001. For the start of the science integration for Cassini\222s prime mission, many of the ground software planning tools were immature or unavailable. To compensate, homegrown tool development occurred at the instrument sites and within science planning. System engineering of these types of ground software tools was lacking. A better paradigm would have been to develop the operations and ground system\222s architecture, requirements models, and software to a level sufficient to support operations pre-launch. Sufficient project resources needed to be applied to Phase B/C/D development. The science planning tools should be developed to a sufficient level during these phases such that th ey can be used as part of evaluating the ground and flight system requirements and capabilities. Based on this evaluation, refinements could be made during cruise and throughout the mission to the unified ground and flight system architecture and software requirements Programmatic  Project Science 227The orbiter consists of 8 Principal Investigator \(PI\struments and 4 Facility Instrument with corresponding Team Leads. In a ddition, there are 5 different science discipline teams: Rings, Saturn, Titan, Icy Satellites and Magnetosphere. The Project Science leader ship needed to be highly involved in the tactical and strategic science planning activities. The consensus building culture used on Cassini was time consuming. The Project Science support staff should be funded adequately to allow the Project Scientist to participate in the integration process. Clear Project Science guidelines are very helpful Instruments 227 Instrument Flight Rule development must be mature pre-launch. Instruments should be designed to minimize impacts on the operations of the other instruments, e.g., radiator placement. Data compression internal to instruments is vital. For Cassini, the science instruments had internal sequencing memory for storing instrument commanding for upcoming sequence. This allowed the science teams th e ability to send real-time noninteractive instrument commands that bypass the sequencing process by using the Automated Sequence Processor \(ASP  In-flight Testing 227 The targeted gravity assist flybys provided a unique opportunity to exercise the ground system on realistic science data acquisition scenarios that simulates the operational environment during the Tour phase of the prime mission. This also had the advantage of providing the science instrument teams an opportunity to acquire useful science data for the purposes of instrument checkout and science data analysis. The in-flight exercises should use the processes, procedures, software, and ground system capabilities in the same manner, to the extent possible, as will be used during Tour and Orbital operations The entire flight team \(mission planning, science planning sequencing, spacecraft, naviga tion, and science teams should be fully engaged to provide the maximum benefit to the Project 7  C ONCLUSION  Even though Cassini was a NASA flagship mission maximizing the science return was a challenge to science planning operations. Decisions aimed at saving both prelaunch and operations costs added considerable complexity to both the spacecraft and the ground system. Among the key ones were removing the scan platform, opting for distributed operations rather than co-location, and delaying development of some flight software and most of the ground system until after launch Understanding the operational challenges to maximizing Cassini science return and the successful techniques employed to overcome those challenges as presented in this paper should be of value to other deep space science missions.  Future missions should carefully consider the following advice 200  Pay careful attention to operational scenarios in development cost saving decisions, both spacecraft and ground. Additional, more sophisticated commanding constructs may be required in operations to compensate for lack of spacecraft capabilities. Ground management of stressed or

We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
