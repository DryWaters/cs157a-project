paper thus attempts to propose a new data-mining algorithm which takes the advantages of fuzzy sets theory to enhance the capability of exploring interesting sequential patterns from the databases with quantitative values The proposed algorithm integrates the concepts of fuzzy sets and the AprioriAll algorithm to find interesting sequential patterns and fuzzy association rules from transaction data 1 INTRODUCTION As useful databases have become public and pervasive the technology of data mining is urgently requested and developed in the recent years Data mining is the process to extract desirable knowledge with interesting patterns for a certain purpose from the existing databases Due to the 
importance of data mining many researchers in database and machine learning fields are primarily interested in this new research topic because it offers opportunities to discover useful information and important relevant patterns in large databases thus helping decision-makers easily analyze the data and make good decisions regarding the domains concerned Data-mining is most commonly used in attempts to induce association rules from transaction data Most previous studies have only shown, however how binary valued transaction data may be handled Transaction data in real-world applications usually consist of quantitative values so designing a sophisticated data-mining algorithm able to deal with various types of data presents 
a challenge to workers in this research field. Among the topics of data mining, finding useful sequential patterns is very interesting It is concerned with inter-transaction patterns which are ordered lists of items instead of unordered sets of items Fuzzy set theory is being used more and more frequently in intelligent systems because of its simplicity and similarity to human reasoning 9 The theory has been applied in fields such as manufacturing engineering diagnosis economics among others 6 9 10 121 The proposed algorithm in this paper integrates the concepts of fuzzy sets and the AprioriAll algorithm 
5 to find interesting sequential patterns and fuzzy association rules from transaction data It transforms quantitative values in transactions into linguistic terms then filters them to find association rules by modifying the AprioriAll mining algorithm 5 The proposed mining algorithm can predict the next plausible consequence underlying the generation of a given sequence of items For example the mined fuzzy rules can predict what products and quantities will be bought next for a customer if a sequence of products and quantities have been bought by him The rules mined out thus exhibit the sequential quantitative regularity in large databases and can be used to provide some 
suggestions to appropriate supervisors 2 REVIEW OF AGRAWAL ET AL.'S DATA-MINING ALGORITHMS The goal of data mining is to discover important associations among items such that the presence of some items in a transaction will imply the presence of some other items To achieve this purpose Agrawal and his co-workers proposed several mining algorithms based on the concept of large itemsets to find association rules in transaction data l 2 3 41 They divided the mining process into two phases In the first phase candidate itemsets were generated and counted by scanning the 
transaction data If the number of an itemset appearing in the transactions was larger than a pre-defined threshold value \(called minimum support the itemset was considered a large itemset Itemsets containing only one item were processed first Large itemsets containing only single items were then combined to form candidate itemsets containing two items This process was repeated until all large itemsets had been found In the second phase association rules were induced from the large itemsets found in the first phase All possible association combinations for each large itemset were formed and those with calculated confidence values larger than a predefined threshold called minimum confidence were output as association rules In addition to proposing methods 
for mining association rules from transactions of binary values, Agrawal et al also proposed a method ll for mining association rules from those with quantitative and categorical attributes Their proposed method first determines the number of partitions for each quantitative attribute, and then maps all possible values of each attribute into a set of consecutive integers It then finds large itemsets whose support values are greater than the user-specified minimum support levels These large itemsets are then processed to generate association rules and rules of interest to users are output 0-7803-5731-0/99/$10.00 01999 IEEE II-962 Agrawal and Srikant also proposed several mining algorithms 


for finding sequential patterns from transaction data Five phases including sort litemset transformation, sequence maximal are included in their algorithms In this paper we use fuzzy set concepts to mine interesting sequential patterns from transactions with quantitative attributes The mined rules are expressed in linguistic terms which are more natural and understandable for human beings 3 THE FUZZY DATA-MINING ALGORITHM FOR SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS In this paper the fuzzy concepts are used in the AprioriAll data mining algorithm 5 to discover interesting sequential patterns and fuzzy association rules from quantitative values Notation used in this paper is first stated as follows n the total number of transaction data m the total number of attributes D\(\222  the i-th transaction datum I l i 5 n A  the j-th attribute I l j I m I A I  the number of fuzzy regions for A R;k  the k-th fuzzy region of Aj  1 5 k 5 I A I  v  the quantitative value of Ai for D\(\222  fj the fizzy set convertedfrom Vy f;;\222  the membership value of Vy\222 in Region Rjk  count jk  the summation of f;;\222 for i=l to n a  the predefined minimum support level 2  the predefined minimum confidence value C the set of candidate itemsets with r attributes \(items L  the set of large itemsets with r attributes \(items The proposed fuzzy mining algorithm first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set with linguistic terms using membership functions It then calculates the scalar cardinality of each linguistic term on all the transaction data The linguistic terms with their scalar cardinalities larger than the minimum support value are kept as the large one-item set Different permutations of patterns with two items are then formed from the large one-item set Fuzzy operations are used to calculate the scalar cardinalities of these patterns The patterns with their scalar cardinalities larger than the minimum support value are thus kept as the large two-item set The same procedure is repeated to find large sets of other numbers of items The mining process based on fuzzy counts is then performed to find fuzzy association rules from these sequential patterns The detail of the proposed mining algorithm is described as follows The Fuzv Data Mining Algorithm for sequential patterns INPUT A body of n transaction data each with m attribute values a set of membership functions a predefine minimum support valuea and a predefined confidence value 1  OUTPUT A set of fuzzy association rules STEP 1 Transform the quantitative value vY of each transaction datum D i  i=l to n for each attribute A j=1 to m into a fuzzy set fy represented as membership functions where RI is the k-th fuzzy region of attribute A f,\(k is v fuzzy membership value in region R,k  and I  A  IS the number of fuzzy regions for A STEP 2 Calculate the scalar cardinality of each attribute region RI in the transaction data I I1 221 n count   fj\222 I STEP 3 For each R 15jlm and IIkllA,I check whether its count j is larger than or equal to the predefined minimum support value a  If R satisfies the above condition put it in the set of large I-itemsets LJ That is L   RJk I count j 2 a 1 ljlm and I I kl A STEP 4 Set FI where r is used to represent the number of items kept in the current large itemsets STEP 5 Generate the candidate set Cr from L except that two regions belonging to the same attribute cannot simultaneously exist in an itemset in Cr Restated, the algorithm first joins L and L under the condition that r-l items in the two itemsets are the same and with the same order of sequences, and the other one is different Different permutations represent different conditions The algorithm then keeps in Cr the itemsets which have all their sub-itemsets of r items existing in L and do not have two items R and RIy p  4 STEP 6 Do the following substeps for each newly formed I itemset s with items   s2  a Calculate the fuzzy value of each transaction data I JI\224 s  in C region sj and s s2  s is a subsequence of D i  If the minimum operator is used for the intersection then If more than one sequence exists find their maximum fuzzy value as the final result b the scalar cardinality of s on the transactions as count  f,\224\222  i=l c count,v is larger than or equal to the predefined STEP 7 IF L is null then do the next step otherwise set rtl and repeat STEPS 5 to 7 STEP 8 Construct the association rules for all large q-itemset s with items 6  s2   sq  422 using the following substeps a Form the possible association rule as follows b Calculate the confidence values of all association minimum support value a  put s in Lp s,As,A  AS 3 scl\221 rules using IJI 963

There are five kinds of products in this example The data set in Table 1 is then represented for each customer according to the occuring time Results are shown in Table 2 0.3/D.Low+0.7/D.Middle 0.5/A.Low+0.3/A.Middle O.3/D.Middle+0.4/D.High 0.3/A.Middle 0.4/A.Hieh Assume the fuzzy membership functions for the product quantities are shown in Figure 1 4 5 6 7 Table 2 The data set reoresented according to occuring time 0.5/B.Low+0.3/B.Middle  1 O/E.Low l.O/A.Middle 0.8/D.High 0.8/B.Low 0.8/E.High 0.7/D.MiddIe+O.Z/D.High O.8/D.Low 0.8/D.High l.O/B.Low 0.7/C.Middle+0.2/C.High   Transaction No I 1 Items bought and Quantities Membership Value Low Middle High Figure 1  The membership functions used in this example In this example the quantities purchased are divided into three fuzzy regions Low Middle and High Thus three fuzzy membership values are produced for each transaction according to the predefined membership functions. For the transaction data in Table 1 the proposed mining algorithm proceeds as follows STEP 1 Transform the quantitative values of each transaction datum into fuzzy sets. Take the B product bought by customer 1 as an example The quantity 2 is converted into a fuzzy set 0.8 0.0 0.0 using the given membership functions   1 Low Middle High This step is repeated for the other products and customers and the results are shown in Table 3 Table 3 The fuzzy sets transformed from the data in Table 2 Each linguistic term such as B.Low is then thought of as an item in the mining process STEP 2 Calculate the scalar cardinality of each item in the transactions as the count value Take the region A.Low as an example Its scalar cardinality  0.3  0.5  0.8 This step is repeated for the other regions, and the results are shown in Table IlI 964

Results for this example are shown in Table 8 C.High D.High E.High Table 8 The fuzzy counts of the itemsets in C A.Middle B.Low I 1.5 Itemset I support 2.0 3.6 3.0 D.High, A.Middle  E.High, D.High 0.0 Itemset D.Hiah E.Hinh D.High B.Low STEP 7 IF Lr is null then do the next step otherwise set r=r+l and repeat STEPs 5 to 7 Since L is not null in the example above r=r+l=2 STEPs 5 to 7 are then repeated to find L C is first generated from L and two itemsets D.High B.Low E.High and D.High E High B.Low are formed Since all their counts are smaller than 2 they are not put in L L is thus an empty set STEP 8 then begins support 2.2 2.4 STEP 8 Construct the association rules for each large itemset using the following substeps a Form all possible association rules The following two association rules are possible If D.High then B.Low, and If D.High then E.High b\Calculate the confidence factors for the above association rules Assume the given confidence threshold 1 is 0.6 Take the second association rule as an example The fuzzy count of D.High E.High is calculated as shown in Table 10 III 965 


Table 10 The fuzzy count of D.High, E.High The confidence factor for the association rule 223lfD High then E  High is then 10 i=l 2.4 3.6 C D.High n E.High  C D.High    0.67 IO i=l In the same way the confidence factor for the association rule 223If D=High, then B.Low\224 is 0.61 STEP 9 Check whether the confidence factors of the above association rules are larger than or equal to the predefined confidence threshold 1  Since the confidence 1 was set at 0.6 in this example the following one rule is thus output to users If a customer purchases high quantity of product D then he will next purchases high quantity of product E with a confidence factor of 0.67 If a customer purchases high quantity of product D then he will next purchases low quantity of product B, with a confidence factor of 0.61 The two rules above are thus output as meta-knowledge concerning the given transactions 5 CONCLUSION In this paper we have proposed a generalized data-mining algorithm which can process transaction data with quantitative values and discover interesting sequential patterns among them The rules can thus predict what products and quantities will be bought next for a customer and can be used to provide some suggestions to appropriate supervisors Although the proposed method works well in data mining for quantitative values it is just a beginning There is still much work to be done in this field Our method assumes that the membership functions are known in advance In 7 81 we also proposed some fuzzy learning methods to automatically derive the membership functions In the future we will attempt to dynamically adjust the membership functions in the proposed mining algorithm to avoid the bottleneck of membership function acquisition We will also attempt to design specific data-mining models for various problem domains REFERENCES I R Agrawal T Imielinksi and A Swami 223Mining Association Rules Between Sets of Items in Large Database,\223 The 1993 ACM SIGMOD Conference Washington DC, USA 1993 2 R.

Recommends that requirements be added to allow connection of power supplies either through isolating transformers for ungrounded secondary or through GFCIs Recommends additional requirement for the oil reservoir of a hydraulic pump to not be more than 35 feet vertically below the tool to guard against loss of insulating value due to partial vacuum in hose Live Line Tools i This section contains requirements for tests and materials handling and storage of live line tools hot sticks Included are the following requirements Specific design testing values for fiberglass and wood hot sticks Visual inspection before use each day and removal from service if a defect or contamination affecting insulating value is found Comments 2 APPA recommends that in accordance with industry practice specific allowance should be made for wiping contaminated tools or refurbishing defective tools and returning them to service after successfully passing specified test EEI states that electric retesting of live line tools is not required unless there is reason to suspect a problem and believes that its position is consistent with the applicable IEEE and ASTM standards EEI proposes rewording paragraph j 2 which addresses the condition of tools and which provides that if contamination exists the tool surface be cleaned before use Also if any defect or contamination is found which adversely affect the insulating qualities or mechanical integrity the tool should be removed from service EEI proposes that the live line tools be removed from service every two years cleaned and/or repaired by qualified personnel and that repaired tools be electrically tested Materials Handlinn and Storage k This section is to be in accordance with 1910 Subpart N and includes the following provisions Specifies distances to energized lines in areas where storage is accessible to unqualified persons \(ten feet plus adder over 50 kV For qualified employees, material may not be stored in working space according to the National Electric Safety Code NESC Unqualified employees may not bring material closer than distances specified in this section, which are based on ten feet for voltages up to 50 kV Comments k APPA recommends that the entire section be deleted and that their attachment be included which is essentially the EEI/IBEW proposal OSHA's proposed distances for qualified employees apparently refers to Table 124-1 of the 1987 NESC which is based on phase to phase clearances APPA recommends that these clearances be on a phase to ground basis in accordance with section \(l of the Rules Tables R-6 and R-7 A2-7 1

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
