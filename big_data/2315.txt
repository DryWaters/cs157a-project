INTRODUCTION\nDue to its overwhelming volume, explosive growth, and\ncontent diversity, image/video data constitutes a major part\nof Big Data, which features volume, velocity, variety, etc.\nand for which the US government launched a new research\nand development initiative in 2012 [2]. According to a Cisco\nreport [1], global mobile data traf?c reached 885 petabytes\nper month in 2012, among which 50% was video traf?c; by\n2017, the global mobile data traf?c would increase 13-fold and\nthe percentage of video traf?c would further increase to two-\nthird. For images, over 1 trillion photos are estimated online\nat any second, from web pages, social media, ad photos, etc.\nIt is expected that the wide availability of imaging and sensor\ndevices would further fuel the growth of image/video data.\nTo tap opportunities afforded by the phenomenal growth\nof image/video data, large scale image/video processing has\nattracted a lot of attentions from both academia and indus-\ntries [5]. For example, face recognition has been studied for\na long time and there are many face recognition systems\ndeployed around the world [6]. However, face recognition\nis still struggling to perform under certain conditions. E.g.,\nits application in the recent Boston bombing investigation\nThe authors are with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineer-\ning, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, N2L 3G1, Canada Emails:\nehyang@uwaterloo.ca; x23yu@uwaterloo.ca. This work was supported in part\nby the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada under\nGrant RGPIN203035-11 and the Canada Research Chairs Program.\nwas considered a failure.There are still many challenges in\nlarge scale image/video processing, which would become even\nharder to deal with as the volume, velocity, and diversity of\nimage/video data continue to grow rapidly and hence warrant\nnew methodologies and new ways of thinking in order to\nadvance the ?eld.\nAmong many challenges in the large-scale image/video data\nprocessing [2], two fundamental issues stand out theoretical\nmodeling for image/video and non-linear data reduction. Since\nthe DCT has been widely applied in image/video processing,\na lot of efforts in theoretic modeling went, in the past a few\ndecades, to understanding the statistical distribution of DCT\ncoef?cients in image/video \(e.g., [4], [9 accurate\nunderstanding of the distribution of DCT coef?cients would\nbe useful to quantization design [4 entropy coding [13],\nrate control, image understanding and enhancement [7], [4],\nand image/video analytics 16], [11] in general. On the other\nhand, linear and non-linear data reduction is of paramount\nimportance to the operability and scalability of large-scale\nimage/video data processing systems.\nWe believe that theoretical modeling for image/video and\nnon-linear data reduction are connected to each other and go\nhand-in-hand. In this paper, our purpose is to present a uni?ed\nway to tackle both. Speci?cally, we propose a new model\ndubbed transparent composite model \(TCM sequence of DCT\ncoef?cients into a tail part and main part. We then model the\ntail part by a uniform distribution and the main part by a\nparametric distribution such as truncated Laplacian or Gen-\neralized Gaussian \(GG use\nfor any given coef?cient; it is marked as transparent because\nthere is no ambiguity regarding which model the uniform or\nparametric boundary and other parameters\nof the TCM can be estimated via maximum likelihood \(ML propose ef?cient online algorithms with\nglobal exponential convergence to compute the ML estimates\nof these parameters.

Furthermore, it is demonstrated\nthat the LPTCM 


also exhibits a good capability of non-\nlinear data reduction. That is, on one hand, data in the heavy\ntail identi?ed by the LPTCM are truly outliers, and these\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 38\noutliers across all AC frequencies of an image represent an\noutlier image revealing some unique global features of the\nimage; on the other hand, the outlier image only contains\na statistically insigni?cant part \(around 1 reduction. This, together\nwith the simplicity of modeling and the fast convergence,\nmakes LPTCM a desirable choice for modeling large-scale\nimage/video data in real-world applications, as shown in a\nfew of our further studies on image/video coding in [12], [15],\nunderstanding in [11], and management in [16].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II\ndiscusses a heavy tail phenomenon in DCT coef?cients. The\nTCM is presented in Section III. Section IV shows the\nmodeling accuracy of TCMs, followed by the non-linear data\nreduction capability of TCMs in Section V. Finally, Section VI\nconcludes the paper.\nII. HEAVY TAIL IN IMAGE/VIDEO DATA\nAs shown in Figure 1, DCT coef?cients of image/video data\nusually possess a heavy tail [8 Figure 1 was obtained by\napplying the ?oating-point type-II 8 × 8 DCT to the well-\nknown Lenna image. It is evident that the histogram of the\nDCT coef?cients ?rst decays quite rapidly and then becomes\nrelatively ?at for the tail portion. Statistically, the tail portion\nis insigni?cant. However, it contains DCT coef?cients of large\nmagnitude, which usually have greater impacts on image\nquality, image features, quantization, etc than other coef?cients\nand hence deserve a better ?t in modeling.\nFigure 1 further zooms in the tail portion and compares the\nhistogram of DCT coef?cients against the GG and Laplacian\nmodels, where the yellow bars again represent the histogram\nof DCT coef?cients, and the red and black curves show\nresults from the GG and Laplacian models, respectively. For\nboth models, the ?2 tests were performed to evaluate their\nrespective modeling accuracy, as follows:\n?2 =\nI?\ni=1\n\(ni ? n · pi 2.1 which the sample space\nis partitioned, n is the total number of samples, ni denotes the\nnumber of samples in the ith interval, and pi is the probability\nunder the underlying theoretical model that a sample falls into\nthe interval i. Similar as in [7], this paper prefers the ?2 test\nover the Kolmogorov-Simrnov for measuring the modeling\naccuracy. Besides the justi?cation provided in [7] for using the\n?2 test, our preference also roots in the heavy-tail phenomena\nof DCT coef?cients.\nAccording to the ?2 test, the GG model signi?cantly out-\nperforms the Laplacian model. Furthermore, in Figure 1, the\nobtained shape parameter ? is much smaller than 1, meaning\nthat the resulting GG distribution possesses a tail heavier than\nthat of the Laplacian distribution. In comparison with the real\ndata histogram shown in Figure 1, however, the GG model\nstill suffers from an exponentially bounded tail, which is much\nlighter than that of the DCT coef?cients.\nThe heavy tail phenomenon in the Lenna image is widely\nobserved in other images as well. As shown in [7], the\n?200 ?150 ?100 ?50 0 50 100 150 200 250\n0\n5\n10\n15\nDCT coefficient magnitude interval with width being 1\nco\nu\nn\nts\nLenna,  Frequency Position \(1 0 magnitude interval with width being 1\nco\nu\nn\nts\nLenna,  Frequency Position \(1 0 GGD 2\(Laplace 0.47045 27.74683 shape parameter ? for the GG distribution for\nvarious images is less than 1 in most cases, indicating that\nthe data distribution possesses a tail heavier than that of the\nLaplacian distribution. Therefore, it is desirable to have a new\nmodel which can balance well the main portion and tail portion\nof DCT coef?cients while having both simplicity and superior\nmodeling accuracy.\nIII. TRANSPARENT COMPOSITE MODEL\nTo better handle the heavy tail phenomenon in DCT coef-\n?cients, we now separate the tail portion of DCT coef?cients\nfrom the main portion of DCT coef?cients and use a different\nmodel to model each of them. Since DCT coef?cients in the\ntail portion are insigni?cant statistically, each of them often\nappears once or a few times in the entire image or video\nframe. Hence it would make sense to model them separately\nby a uniform distribution while modeling the main portion by\na parametric distribution such as truncated Laplacian, or GG,\nyielding a model we call a transparent composite model. In\nthis section, we assume that DCT coef?cients are continuous\nand consider continuous TCMs. Extension to the discrete cases\ncan be found in [14].\nA. Description of general continuous TCMs\nConsider a probability density function \(pdf y and ? is the\nparameter space. Let F \(y y u that f\(y y region\n39\ny ? 0.

It shows that\nthe LPTCM ?ts the histogram of DCT coef?cients quite well\nand greatly improves upon the Laplacian model. In comparison\nwith the Laplacian model, it ?ts both the main and tail portions\nbetter. In terms of ?2 values, it matches up to the GG model.\nMore detailed comparisons will be presented in Section IV.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON MODELING ACCURACY\nThis section presents experimental results of applying\nTCMs to continuous DCT coef?cients and compare them with\nthose from the Laplacian and GG models. As discussed in\nSection II, modeling accuracy in this paper is measured by the\n?2 test, as de?ned in \(2.1 512×512 images are\nused to demonstrate the performance. They are referred to as\n‘bird’, ‘boat’, ‘?sh couple/Cp’, ‘hill’, ‘lenna’, ‘baboon/Bb’,\n‘mountain/Bt’, and ‘pepper/Pp’, respectively. \(Tests have also\nbeen conducted on hundreds of Jpeg images from various\ncameras and show consistence with the reported results They\nare not presented here due to the space limit model, GGTCM,\nand LPTCM.\nA. Overall comparisons for each image\nIn general, the GGTCM outperforms the GG model the\nLPTCM outperforms the Laplacian model, and the GG model\noutperforms the Laplacian model, as one would expect.

For example, for the image\n‘bird’, in terms of the ?2 metric, the LPTCM is better than\nthe GG model for 62 out of 63 frequencies; for the image\n‘lenna’, the LPTCM is better than the GG model for 42 out\nof 63 frequencies. Overall, it would be fair to state that the\nLPTCM and GG model behave similarly in terms of modeling\naccuracy. And yet, the LPTCM has much lower computation\ncomplexity than the GG model.\nB Comparisons of ?2 for individual frequencies\nWe have compared the ?2 results for individual frequencies\nfor all testing images. While detailed data are omitted here and\ncan be found in [14], the results are summarized as follows:\n1 LPTCM is better than\nthe GG model, ?2LPTCM is often much smaller, up to 1000 times\nsmaller, than ?2GGD; and 3 when the GG model is better than\nthe LPTCM, the difference between ?2LPTCM and ?2GGD is much\nsmaller than in Case 2 observations,\ntogether with the fact that Algorithm 2 converges exponentially\nfast and is analytically much simpler than a GG estimation\nalgorithm as in [7], show that LPTCM achieves the best trade-\noff between modeling accuracy and complexity.\n42\nV. NON-LINEAR DATA REDUCTION AND APPLICATIONS\nThis section brie?y discusses the non-linear data reduction\ncapability of TCMs and its application in various areas of\nimage/video processing in Big Data [11][12][15][16].\nA. Data reduction\nTCMs enable us to represent an image by TCM parameters\nand some outlier coef?cients, yielding a signi?cant data reduc-\ntion. Speci?cally, outlier coef?cients are identi?ed by a TCM\nparameter yc, which is the cutting point between a parametric\ndistribution for the main portion and the uniform distribution\nfor the heavy tail part. Statistically, outlier coef?cients i.e.,\nthose falling beyond yc, are not signi?cant—although the\nactual number of outliers varies from one frequency to another\nand from one image to another, it typically ranges in our\nexperiments from less than 0.1 of the total number of AC\ncoef?cients to 19% with an average around 1.2%. As a result,\noutliers achieve about 99% data reduction in the raw data\nformat \(i.e., without compression information rate for outliers\nwhen compression is applied, i.e., how many bits are needed\nto represent outliers. [15] presents a study of applying TCMs\nto enhance entropy coding design for DCT coef?cients where\noutliers are encoded separately from inliers. It is observed that\noutliers consume about 5% of the total bits after compression.\nIt is thus interesting to see how much information has\nbeen preserved in an outlier image from an image percep-\ntion perspective to validate the data reduction capability of\nTCMs for image/video applications. Figure 3 includes a high\nde?nition original image, a so-called inlier image, and an\noutlier image. An inlier image is generated by ?rst forcing\nall outlier coef?cients to zero and then performing the inverse\nDCT. An outlier image, on the other hand, is generated by\n?rst keeping only outliers, forcing all other DCT coef?cients\nto zero, and then performing the inverse DCT. As the inlier\nimage contains all DC components and inlier AC components,\na down-sizing operation would impact our perception on the\ndifference between the original image and the inlier image.\nHence, Figure 3 is presented here in a size as large as allowed\nby the column space. In Figure 3, the basketball net is well\nsketched in the outlier image, but is much blurred in the\ninlier image. It is shown that the tail portion is perceptually\nimportant. This, together with the statistical insigni?cance of\noutliers, makes the outlier image appealing to image applica-\ntions in Big Data. On one hand, compared with the original\nimage, the outlier image achieves dramatic data reduction.\nOn the other hand, due to the preservation of perceptually\nimportant global information of the original image in the\noutlier image, some aspects of image understanding can be\ncarried out from the outlier image with perhaps better accuracy\nbut less computation complexity.\nFinally, it is worth pointing out that outlier images are\nrelated to, but different from conventional edge detection. An\noutlier image captures some global uniqueness in an image,\nwhile edges are usually detected based on local irregularity in\nthe pixel domain.\nB. Image analytics\nOne application of DCT models is to measure the similarity\namong images by estimating the model parameters of different\nimages and calculating a distribution distance. Apparently,\nthis type of similarity measurement roots in data histograms.\nYet, in practice, histograms are not convenient to use, and\nrequire a heavy overhead. This is particularly problematic for\na large scale image management system On the other hand,\nmodel-based distribution distances use only a few parameters\nwith a negligible overhead thus providing a good similarity\nmeasurement between digital images particularly when the\nmodeling accuracy is high. Studies along this line to use the\nLPTCM for image similarity have been conducted in [16] and\nshow a promising performance.\nThe outlier concept discussed in Subsection V-A can be used\nto further enhance image similarity testing based on model-\nbased distribution distances. Since outliers are 


insigni?cant\nstatistically, their impact on model-based distribution distances\nmay not be signi?cant. And yet if two images look similar,\ntheir respective outlier images must look similar too. As such,\none can build other metrics based on outlier images to further\nenhance image similarity testing. In addition, an outlier image\ncan also be used to detect whether a given image is scenic\nand to help improving face detection [11 These and other\napplications using the LPTCM will be further studied.\nC. Data compression\n1 algorithm design: Entropy coding de-\nsign in image and video coding such as JPEG, H.264 and\nHEVC is closely related to understanding the DCT coef?cient\nstatistics, due to the wide application of DCT in image/video\ncompression. The superior modeling accuracy by TCM has\nbeen utilized to design an entropy coding scheme for discrete\nDCT coef?cients \(such as in JPEG images  rate saving when com-\npared with a standard JPEG entropy codec for high ?delity\nJPEG images \(with quantization step size being 1 for most\nlow frequency AC positions state-of-the-art lossless coding methods for DCT\ncoef?cients [13].\n2 Quantization design, as\nthe core of lossy coding, roots in the rate distortion theory,\nwhich generally requires a statistic model to provide guidance\nto practical designs. Quantization design in DCT-based image\nand video coding usually assumes a Laplacian distribution due\nto its simplicity and fair modeling accuracy. In [12] LPTCM\nis applied to design new quantizers for DCT coef?cients and\na new DCT-based non-predictive image compression system,\nwhich is signi?cantly better than JPEG and the state-of-the-art\nDCT-based non-predictive image codec in terms of compres-\nsion ef?ciency. It also compares favorably with the state-of-\nthe-art DCT-based predictive codecs such as H.264/AVC intra\ncoding and HEVC intra coding in high rate cases in terms of\nthe trade-off between compression ef?ciency and complexity.\nVI CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has proposed a new model dubbed transparent\ncomposite model \(TCM fundamental issues in\n43\ninliners image \noutliner image \nFig. 3.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration. This infonnation will be \nused to create a baseline behavior for comparison with \nactual data to discriminate between nonnal and abnormal nbehavior. \nTable 3 is a list of biological diagnostic measurements to be \nincluded in CCSDS telemetry available for ground \npersonnel to complete a prognostic analysis used to predict \nmental illness would be occurring in the near future. In the \nevent that the presence of accelerated aging is identified, \nindicating that mental illness will occur, changes to the \nenvironment to the environment can be made to prevent \nmental illness from occurring. \nTable 3 includes 3 5  measurements are from the circadian \nand ultranian rhythms including the value for the least \nsignificant bit \(LSB into telemetry in the CCSDS format and the \nexpected extreme range that the measurement will need to \nmeasure across and not be exceeded. The LSB value is \nimportant because it defines the smallest increment n\(resolution e.g. knowledge the \nmeasurement. The measurement range is important to defme \nthe 5th or 6th degree polynomial used to convert the 8-bit \ndigital words in telemetry back to analog telemetry so the \ntelemetry processing and display system can accurately \ndisplay the biological and engineering diagnostic \ninformation to ground personnel for analysis. \n1 7  \nTable 3 .

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
