maximize their existing infrastructure to avoid the traf\336c congestion Reliable analysis of the historical traf\336c data is an important part for traf\336c prediction system Therefore data mining is capable of analyzing the real-time traf\336c data to predict the traf\336c 337ow As one of the most popular data mining techniques association rule mining has been proposed by Agrawal et al in 1993 which aims to disco v er association relationships among a set of attributes in a database The form of association rules is represented as 323 002 X Y Y Student Member IEEE Genetic Network Programming with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for Class Association rule Mining in Traf\336c Prediction  Shingo Mabu  Huiyu Zhou Kaoru Shimada and Kotaro Hirasawa 321 As an extension of Genetic Algorithm GA and Genetic Programming GP a new approach named Genetic Network Programming GNP has been proposed in the evolutionary computation 336eld GNP uses multiple reusable nodes to construct directed-graph structures to represent its solutions Recently many research has clari\336ed that GNP can work well in data mining area In this paper a novel evolutionary paradigm named GNP with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms GNPEDAs is proposed and used to solve traf\336c prediction problems using class association rule mining In GNP-EDAs a probabilistic model is constructed by estimating the probability distribution from the selected elite individuals of the previous generation to replace the conventional genetic operators such as crossover and mutation The probabilistic model is capable of enhancing the evolution to achieve the ultimate objective In this paper two methods are proposed based on extracting the probabilistic information on the node connections and node transitions of GNP-EDAs to construct the probabilistic model A comparative study of the proposed paradigm and the conventional GNP is made to solve the traf\336c prediction problems using class association rule mining The simulation results showed that GNP-EDAs can extract the class association rules more effectively when the number of the candidate class association rules increases And the classi\336cation accuracy of the proposed method shows good results in traf\336c prediction systems X 323 which denotes that if antecedent part is satis\336ed then consequent part will occur As an extension Liu et al have proposed a method to integrate the classi\336cation and association rule mining in which the consequent part is restricted to a single classi\336cation class attribute In order to disco v er class association rules using evolutionary computation algorithms is effective to establish the space of candidate solutions and The authors are with the Graduate School of Information Production and

J H Holland proposed two kinds of methods Pittsburgh approach and Michigan approach based on Genetic Algorithm GA to deal with data mining problems  Ho we v er  Michig an approach represents an entire rule as an individual and Pittsburgh approach represents an entire rule a part of an individual which hardly give a complete picture of the underlying relationships in data Therefore it is not easy to extract enough number of association rules Genetic Programming GP 5 which evolves individuals as tree structures enables a more explicit representation of candidate rules Nevertheless when dealing with dynamic problems it may suffer from the problem of the loose structure and bloating As an extension of GA and GP a new evolutionary computation named Genetic Network Programming GNP  7 8 has been proposed recently  GNP uses directedgraph structures to represent its solutions which is capable of dealing with dynamic environments ef\336ciently and effectively The 336xed number of nodes is used to build the directed-graph structures which can avoid the bloating problem compared with GP Moreover a GNP-based association rule mining method has been proposed for s olving the traf\336c prediction problems in which GNP is used as a tool to extract candidate association rules The method can handle the databases to extract the time-related association rules which can tell not only what events happen together but also at what time the event will occur However as many other evolutionary computation techniques GNP adopts crossover and mutation to generate the offspring and the major drawback of GNP is the heavy computation required The interrelations called building blocks are kept implicitly between the different nodes in the individuals of GNP Generally speaking reproducing the building blocks is a very powerful principle to solve the decomposable problems But the crosso v er and mutation w ork just like a kind of random operators to explore the search space which might decompose the building blocks implicitly saved in the individuals of GNP One possible way for overcoming this problem is to prevent the breakage of building blocks to reduce the production of invalid individuals Therefore in this paper a novel evolutionary paradigm named GNP with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms GNP-EDAs has been proposed to improve the ef\336ciency for generating valid offspring which combines GNP and EDAs  12  13 to avoid the break down of building blocks and improve the ef\336ciency of evolution EDAs are population-based probabilistic search algorithms 978-1-4244-8126-2/10/$26.00

are a little worse When decreases the easier the rules could be extracted since the threshold of support con\336dence and decreases the number of potential candidate rules increases As a result the ef\336ciency of GNP-EDAs will be signi\336cantly improved in terms of extracting many rules by the effective probabilistic model which leads to the better rule extraction ef\336ciency of the proposed method than the conventional GNP In evolutionary algorithm based class association rule mining the strongly related attributes corresponding to judgment nodes in GNP and GNP-EDAs could be viewed as building blocks that could be recombined in the next generation The principle why GNP and GNP-EDAs could work for 336nding class association rules is decomposing the problems to 336nd strongly associated judgment nodes building blocks and recombine them by evolution Therefore the simulation results of rule extraction shows that GNP-EDAs could outperform the conventional GNP when dealing with the problems with a large number of building blocks scattered in the search space such as decomposable problems On the other hand the prediction accuracy is in an acceptable range even if the value of decreases from 0.9 to 0.8 but the rule extraction ef\336ciency of the proposed method will greatly increase comparing with the conventional GNP by reducing step traf\336c prediction can keep the same level as the conventional GNP Therefore considering the rule extraction ef\336ciency and prediction accuracy as a whole the proposed algorithm can provide a better trade-off between the

Memory Requirements Evaluation For evaluating the memory requirements of three algorithms, the experiments focus on two aspects 1 We verify the memory requirements of tree construction among three algorithms with different minimum supports in T10I4D100K database. The result is shown in Fig. 11 As shown in Fig. 11, the results are not influenced by different minimum supports because theses algorithms are minimum support value independent. Nevertheless, for constructing T10I4D100K data set, CATS tree spent 15,654KB 


GC tree spent 19,881KB, and SC tree only spent 13,030KB SC tree algorithm saves about 17% and 34% than CATS tree and GC tree Then, we evaluate the influences of different transaction sizes with a fixed minimum support 0.4%. As shown in Fig. 12 we can find that the average constructing space for SC tree saves about 16% and 34% than CATS tree and GC tree 2 In this part, we focus on memory requirements of mining process. Three algorithms will be verified with different minimum support under 500K transactions and different transaction sizes under fixed minimum support 0.2%.

CONCLUSION AND FURTURE WORKS In this paper, a new tree structure called SC tree and a mining algorithm for association rule are proposed. Advantages of several algorithms are combined in this algorithm, and experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm outperforms CATS tree and GC tree mining algorithms For the SC tree algorithm, the mining model \(tree structure does not need to be re-constructed while the minimum support is changed. This property enables users to adjust the minimum support dynamically to find out satisfied large itemsets Because the database is sorted before mining, the SC tree can be mined only from the bottom-up direction, which is quite different from the bi-directional mining in CATS tree and thus the mining time for SC tree is shorter than CATS tree Moreover, the arrangement of sorted transactions is consistent so it is unnecessary for SC tree to adjust the tree structure as in CATS tree. That further improves the efficiency of tree construction in SC tree In addition, the memory requirements for constructing and mining the tree structure of SC tree are also less than both the CATS tree algorithm and the GC tree algorithm. Experimental results show that SC tree algorithm saves 16%~ 34% of memory space Although SC tree algorithm is more efficient than the other approaches, there are still some aspects can be considered for further improvement. One is the process of pre-sorting. When 


the data set is updated, the whole database has to be re-sorted If only partial tree structure rather than the whole tree structure is to be adjusted, execution time can be reduced substantially Another aspect is the scalability. When applying the SC tree algorithm in a large database, employing the technique of parallel and distributed computing can not only lightens the loading of processers and the requirement memory space but also suits for the architecture of disturbed computing environment in enterprises REFFERENCE 1] Peng, Y., Kou, G., Shi, Y., and Chen, Z., A Descriptive Framework for the Field of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery , International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, Vol. 7, Issue: 4, Page 639 - 682, 2008 2] R.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
