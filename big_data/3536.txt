most concerned issues because processing large-scale privacy-sensitive data sets often requires computation power provided by public cloud services. Sub-tree data anonymization, achieving a good trade-off between data utility and distortion, is a widely adopted scheme to anonymize data sets for privacy preservation. Top-Down Specialization TDS\ and Bottom-Up Generalization BUG are two ways to fulfill sub-tree anonymization. However existing approaches for sub-tree anonymization fall short of parallelization capability, thereby lacking scalability in handling big data on cloud Still, both TDS and BUG suffer from poor performance for certain value of k anonymity

IT industry and research communities [1  C l o u d computing elastically provides massive computation power and storage capacity via utilizing a large number of commodity computers together, enabling users to deploy big data applications cost-effectively without heavy infrastructure investment.  To exploit the advantages offered by public cloud platforms, more and more big data applications have been moving into cloud, including a variety of privacy-sensitive applications like health care data and transactional data storing and processing Consequently, how to protect the privacy of these data sets is a big challenge. Indeed, numerous potential customers are still hesitant to take advantage of cloud due to privacy and security concerns [3  P r i v a c y i s o n e o f th e m o s t  
concerned issues in the big data applications that involve multiple parties, and the concern aggravates in the context of cloud computing although some privacy i ssues are not new [1  H e n c e  d a ta p r iv ac y is s u e s  n e e d to b e a d d r e s s e d  urgently before data sets are analyzed or shared on cloud Data anonymization extensively studied and widely adopted [4  is a n  e f f e c tiv e w a y f o r d at a p r iv ac y preservation Data anonymization refers to hiding identity and/or sensitive data for owners of data records. Then, the privacy of an individual can be effectively preserved while certain aggregate information is exposed to data users for diverse analysis and mining. Sub-tree anonymization scheme is widely adopted to anonymize data sets for privacy preservation, producing a good trade-off between data utility and distortion. There are two ways to 
accomplish sub-tree anonymization, i.e., Top-Down Specialization \(TDS and Bottom-Up Generalization BUG\. So far, a series of approaches have been proposed for TDS or BUG [5 6 7 8 H o w e ve r  da t a s e t s i n  bi g data applications on cloud have become so large that it is a big challenge for existing sub-tree anonymization algorithms to anonymize such data sets in a scalable fashion, due to their lack of parallelization capability. Still both TDS and BUG suffer from poor performance for certain value of k anonymity parameter if they are utilized individually where k anonymity privacy model  i s adopted. Specifically, TDS is preferred when 
k is large while BUG is favorable when k is small MapReduce [1   a l a rge s c a l e  d a t a p r o c e s s i n g  framework, have been integrated with cloud to provide powerful computation capability for applications, e.g Amazon Elastic MapReduce \(EMR\ service [11 We leverage MapReduce on cloud to address the scalability problem in our approach. As the MapReduce computation paradigm is relatively simple, it is still a challenge to design proper MapReduce jobs for TDS and BUG In this paper, we propose a highly scalable hybrid approach that combines TDS and BUG together for subtree anonymization over big data. The approach automatically determines which component is used to conduct the anonymization when a data set is given, by 
comparing the user-specified k anonymity parameter with a threshold derived from the data set Both components TDS and BUG are developed based on MapReduce to gain high scalability by exploiting powerful computation capability of cloud. Havi ng designed MapReduce based TDS in [12  w e o n l y p r es e n t th e M apR educ e a l go r ithm i c  design of BUG herein.

scalability and efficiency of sub-tree data anonymization via automatically choosing TDS or BUG. Secondly, a group of innovative MapReduce jobs are designed for BUG to concretely conduct the computation in a highly scalable fashion. Lastly, experimental evaluations demonstrate that the hybrid approach improves the scalability and efficiency of sub-tree anonymization scheme over existing approaches The remainder of this paper is organized as follows The next section reviews related work, and analyzes the problems in existing sub-tree anonymization approaches In Section III, we briefly present the preliminary concepts for our approach Section IV elaborates algorithmic details of MapReduce jobs for BUG, and Section V formulates the hybrid approach. We empirically evaluate our approach in Section VI. Finally, we conclude this paper and discuss future work in Section VII II R ELATED W ORK AND P ROBLEM A NALYSIS A Related Work Privacy preservation on data has been extensively investigated and fruitful progress has been made by research communities [4  W e b r ie f ly  r e v ie w t h e  r e la te d  work as follows A bulk of privacy models and anonymization approaches have been put forth to preserve the privacysensitive information in data sets k anonymity a nd l diversity  a r e  t w o b a s i c  a n d w i d el y a d op t e d p ri v a c y  models to measure the degree of privacy-sensitive information disclosure against record linkage attacks and attribute linkage attacks, respectively. Other privacy models like t closeness [1 a nd m invariance [15 ar e al s o  proposed for various privacy attack scenarios. Several anonymizing operations are leveraged to anonymize data sets, including generalization [5 16 17  ana t o mi zat i o n   s l i c i n g  1 9    d i s a s s o c i a t i o n 2 0   e t c  I n  t h i s  p a pe r w e  leverage generalization which replaces some domain values with a parent value in the taxonomy tree. Roughly there are four generalization schemes  n a m e l y  fu l l domain [21  s u b t r e e   5    m ul t id ime ns io na l  1 6   a n d c e ll  generalization [1    Our research herein concentrates on the sub-tree generalization scheme Unlike multidimensional or cell schemes, sub-tree scheme can produce consistent anonymous data that can be directly used by existing data mining and data analysis tools This scheme offers a good trade-off between data utility and data consistency. Thus this scheme has been extensively explored Top-Down Specialization TDS\ [5 6 7 12 a n d B o tto m U p Generalization BUG  a re two ways to fulfill the subtree scheme.  Most exiting algorithms exploit indexing data structure to assist the process of anonymization Specifically, TIPS \(Taxonomy Indexed PartitionS\ for TDS and TEA \(Taxonomy Encoded Anonymity\ index for BUG Although indexing data structures can speed up the process of data anonymization, these approaches often fail to work in parallel or distributed environments like cloud systems because the indexing structures are centralized Mohammed et al. [6 opo s e d a  T D S a p p r o a c h w h i c h   however, mainly concerns privacy protection against other parities rather than scalability issues. Still, this approach only employs information gains as the search metric resulting lower data utility than centralized ones.  Our previous work [12 l e v e r a ge s M apR educ e t o  a c co m p l i s h  the intensive computation required in big data anonymization via TDS But TDS probably performs slower than BUG when k anonymity parameter is small Scalability and efficiency of anonymization algorithms for privacy preservation has drawn attention of researchers R-tree indexing, scalable decision trees and sampling techniques are introduced to achieve high scalability and efficiency [22 23  H o w e v er th e p r o p o s e d ap p r o a c h es  aim at multidimensional scheme, thereby failing to work for sub-tree generalization MapReduce has been widely adopted in various data processing applications to boost scalability and efficiency [24 25 26  F o llo w i n g t hi s  li n e  we also leverage MapReduce to advance scalability and efficiency in our research on big data anonymization B Problem Analysis In this section, we analyze the problem of utilizing Top-Down Specialization TDS\ or Bottom-Up Generalization BUG alone for sub-tree generalization and the scalability problem of existing BUG approaches At present, existing TDS and BUG approaches are developed individually for sub-tree generalization scheme Both of them lack the awareness of the user-specified k anonymity parameter. In fact, the values of the k anonymity parameter can impact their performance Intuitively, if parameter k is large, TDS is more suitable while BUG will probably get bad performance. The case is reversed when k is small. A simple example is described below to demonstrate the above intuition Assume that a data set has 10 records with the attribute Education that needs generalization for privacy preservation. The taxonomy tree of this attribute and attribute value of records are depicted in Fig. 1. At one extreme, let k be set as 2. In this case, TDS has to specialize several domain values to achieve 2-anonymity while BUG will do nothing as the data set is alr eady 2anonymity. At other extreme, let k be set as 5. In such a case, TDS will do nothing to achieve 5-anonymity while BUG has to conduct generalization. It can be seen from the example that selecting TDS or BUG according to k significantly impacts the performance of the sub-tree anonymization scheme As such, it is promising to develop a hybrid approach that encompasses TDS and BUG as two components so Education of Recs Junior 2 Senior 2 Bachelors 3 Graduate 3 Any_Education Secondary University Junior Senior Bachelors Graduate Figure 1 Education taxonomy tree and records

that the high scalability and efficiency can be gained regardless of valuing of the k anonymity parameter. The key to the hybrid approach is how to design a user-friendly method to automatically determine which component should be chosen. Although a domain expert is able to determine which approach is preferred to conduct anonymization manually according to the value of parameter k ordinary users in the cloud probably fail to do this due to their lack of background knowledge As to BUG, the existing approach in [8 e xpl oi t s  indexing data structure to promote efficiency, thereby falling short of high scalability and parallelization in cloud environments. Thus, it is worthwhile investigating how to develop BUG algorithm with MapReduce in order to improve the scalability and efficiency. A promising way is to conduct generalization operations in parallel As MapReduce only provides primitive programming model how to develop MapReduce jobs to conduct the computation required by data anonymization is still critical in the whole design and needs intensive research Above all, the problem we attempt to address is how to design scalable and efficient BUG algorithm based on MapReduce and how to automatically select a component for the proposed hybrid approach according to parameter k  III P RELIMINARY A Sub-Tree Ge neralization Scheme To facilitate subsequent discussion, we briefly introduce the sub-tree generalization scheme as background knowledge. Table 1 lists some basic symbols and notations We assume there is one sensitive value in one record like medical diagnosis, as more sensitive values will not affect our discussion. The leaf node values of a taxonomy tree TT i are original attribute values of records in D We use QI as the acronym of quasi-identifier. The quasi-identifier group is abbreviated as QI-group [27   Without loss of generality, we adopt k anonymity [9 as  the privacy model in this paper, i.e., for any 002\003\004 005 006\007\010  the size of 006\007\011  002\003\004  must be zero or at least k so that a quasi-identifier will not be distinguished from other at least k 1 quasi-identifiers In sub-tree generalization scheme, all child values of a non-leaf node or none in a domain hierarchy are generalized to the node. Two operations can be employed to accomplish this scheme, i.e., generalization for BUG and specialization for TDS, respectively. A generalization operation is to replace a domain value with its parent in a taxonomy tree while a specialization operation is to replace a domain value with its all child values. Formally a generalization is represented as 012\013\014: \015\016\003\017\004\(\002 020 002 while a specialization is represented as 021\022\013\023 002 020 015\016\003\017\004\(\002 where 002 005 010\024\025 003 is a domain value and the set 015\016\003\017\004\(\002 consists of all child domain values of 002 We leverage the concept anonymization level [12  to c ap tu r e  the degree of anonymization Specifically, anonymization level, denoted as 026\027 is a vector of domain values sets i.e 026\027  030 015\031\032 1  015\031\032 2  033  015\031\032 034 035 where 015\031\032 003  1\036\003\036\034 is the cut of 037\037 003  A cut of a tree is a subset of values in the tree that contains exactly one value on each root-to-leaf path [4  To guide the selection of the best operations in the anonymization process, the goodness of a candidate generalization or specialization is measured by a search metric. We leverage the information/privacy trade-off as the search metric for our approach, i.e., the Information Gain per Privacy Loss \(IGPL\ for TDS and the Information Loss per Privacy Gain \(ILPG for BUG respectively [4  W e briefly describe how to calculate the value of ILPG subsequently. Interested readers can refer to 12 f o r I G P L c alc u l at io n o r  4  f o r mo r e de t a ils  Given a generalization 012\013\014 015\016\003\017\004  002  020\002 the ILPG of the generalization is calculated by 007\027!\011  012\013\014  007\027  012\013\014    011  012\013\014  1   1 The term 007\027  012\013\014  is the information loss after performing 012\013\014 and 011  012\013\014  is the privacy gain. Both of them are computed via statistical information derived from data sets.

An instance running Map function is called Mapper and that running Reduce function is called Reducer respectively Between Map phase and Reduce phase exists a Shuffle phase, during which the intermediate key-value pairs are sorted according to keys IV B OTTOM U P G ENERALIZATION U SING M AP R EDUCE We mainly elaborate Bottom-Up Generalization using MapReduce \(MRBUG\ in this section. Basically, a practical MapReduce program encompasses Map and Reduce functions, and a Driver that coordinates the macro execution of MapReduce jobs. Thus, we describe the Bottom-Up Generalization MapReduce Driver in Section IV.A to present the basic process of bottom-up generalization Section IV.B and IV.C present the MapReduce jobs in detail A Bottom-Up Generalization MapReduce Driver Basically, Bottom-Up Generalization BUG approach of anonymization is an iterative process starting from the lowest anonymization level The lowest anonymization level contains the internal domain nodes in the lowest level of taxonomy trees. Each round of iteration includes four major steps, namely, checking the current data set whether satisfies the anonymity requirement, calculating the ILPG finding the best generalization and generalizing the data set according to the selected best generalization candidate Calculating the ILPG and generalizing the data set involve accessing a large number of data records, thereby dominating the scalability and efficiency of bottom-up generalization. An existing approach [8 u t ili z e s  in d e x i n g  data structure and retaining statistic information to improve the efficiency. But the approach suffers from poor scalability and efficiency in a big data scenario. Still, the approach fails to be adapted into MapReduce since MapReduce does not support indexing data structure As such, we propose to develop innovative MapReduce jobs for the ILPG computation. As the notion of anonymization level is introduced to describe anonymization status of a data set, it is unnecessary to generalize the data set concretely in each round in regards to efficiency Instead, we abstractly generalize the data set over the current anonymization level. After the final anonymization level is obtained, we anonymize the data set in a one-pass MapReduce job. Algorithm 1 presents the Bottom-Up Generalization MapReduce \(BUGMR\ driver We detail Algorithm 1 as follows. Firstly, ILPG values of all generalizations are initialized \(line 1\. Line 2 checks whether the current anonymized data set satisfies the k anonymity requirement Line 3 finds the best generalization 012\013\014 9\013\021\032 with the highest ILPG value and Line 4 generalizes this generalization by labeling it as INACTIVE  That a generalization is labeled as INACTIVE means the generalization will not be considered any more in following rounds, abstractly fulfilling anonymization on the data set. Let 011>\013\032\(\012\013\014 denote the set containing generalization 012\013\014 and its all siblings in the domain taxonomy tree. When the generalizations in 011>\013\032\(\012\013\014 are all labeled as INACTIVE a new higher level generalization should be inserted to replace these inactive ones lines 5, 6 and 7\. Note that this is a remarkable difference from TDS. Line 9 updates the privacy gain of each active generalization as the performing 012\013\014 9\013\021\032 probably changes the anonymity of the data set. Also information loss computation is required if a new generalization has been inserted. As the last step line 11 concretely anonymizes the data set according the final anonymization level Lines 1 and 9 require ILPG calculation that involves accessing to the original data set and computing statistic information over the data set Line 11 also needs processing the whole data set. We leverage MapReduce to conduct the intensive computation in these situations Specifically, we design a couple of innovative MapReduce jobs: job ILPG Calculation for accomplishing the computation required in lines 1 and 9, and job Data Generalization for achieving the final concrete anonymization in line 11. The ILPG related MapReduce job is elaborated in Section IV.B and job Data Generalization is in IV.C, respectively B ILPG Calculation Job The ILPG Calculation job is responsible to ILPG initialization in line 1 of Algorithm 1 and ILPG update in line 9 The computation required in ILPG initialization is quite similar to that of ILPG update The Map function of the ILPG Calculation is depicted in Algorithm 2, while the Reduce function is presented in Algorithm 3. In Algorithm 2 and 3, the symbol # is used to identify whether a key is emitted to compute information gain or anonymity loss, and $ is to differentiate the cases whether a key is for computing 026 022 021\022\013\023 or 026 023 021\022\013\023  Algorithm 2 is detailed as follows. Let NGSet denote the set of newly inserted generalizations. For ILPG initialization NGSet is the set of all the initial generalizations with respect to 026\027 3 while for ILPG

Line 1 of Algorithm 2 transforms an original record into its anonymized form according to the current anonymization level, for the sake of being counted. To compute  022    022 0210   023  and  023 0210 in \(2 for information loss calculation, line 2 emits the key-value pair to the Reduce function for information loss computation if this pair is a new generalization candidate Note that the information loss of a generalization will not be affected when we perform other generalizations or insert a new generalization, while privacy gain will probably be impacted as the anonymity of the data set will change Line 3 of Algorithm 2 aims at figuring out the anonymity of the data set before performing a generalization, i.e 026 023  012\013\014  while line 4 emits key-value pairs to obtain the anonymity after performing a generalization, i.e 026 022  012\013\014  As 026 023  012\013\014  is unique globally, we just emit the current quasi-identifier 002\003\004 for statistics. As to 026 022  012\013\014  potential anonymous quasiidentifiers for 002\003\004 will be emitted for computing 026 022  012\013\014  for different active generalization candidates. After obtaining 026 022  012\013\014  and 026 023  012\013\014  we can update privacy gain for each generalization in terms of \(3 The Reduce function described in Algorithm 3 mainly aggregates the statistical information to calculate information loss and privacy gain. Lines 1 to 5 calculate information loss in terms of \(2\. Due to that the key-value pairs are sorted by MapReduce before being fed to Reducer workers, the Reduce function can compute information loss for generalizations in sequence, without requiring large amount of memory to retaining statistical information. Therefore, the Reduce function is highly scalable for calculating information loss The essential of computing anonymity of a data set is to find out the minimum QI-group size. Lines 6 to 10 aim at calculating privacy gain. The Reducer workers find out the locally minimum QI-gr oup size before and after performing a generalization in parallel Then, we can obtain the globally one in the driver program through comparing the outputs of Reducer workers. As such, the ILPG Calculation Reduce function is highly scalable for both information loss and privacy gain computation. After obtaining information loss and privacy gain, we can calculate ILPG values according to \(1 C Data Generalization The original data set is concretely generalized for data anonymization by a one-pass MapReduce job, i.e Data Generalization Details of Map and Reduce functions of the data specialization MapReduce job are described in Algorithm 4. The Map function emits anonymous records and its count according to the current anonymization level The Reduce function simply aggregates these anonymous records and counts their number. An anonymous record and its count represent a QI-group, and the QI-groups constitute the final anonymous data sets V H YBRID A PPROACH FOR S UB T REE A NONYMIZATION A Combining Top-Down Specialization and Bottom-Up Generalization Now that the MapReduce version of Bottom-Up Generalization \(MRBUG\ has been developed in the last section, the two components, i.e., MRTDS [12 a n d  MRBUG are ready for the proposed hybrid approach of sub-tree anonymization over big data. In terms of the problem analysis in Section II.B, we need to determine which component is used to anonymize data after the anonymity parameter k is specified by a user. It is promising that the hybrid approach can automatically give out a threshold K such that if 8JK MRTDS is selected otherwise MRBUG is selected. Formally, we define this threshold as Workload Balancing Point Definition 1  Workload Balancing Point An anonymity value of a data set, denoted as K  is defined as workload balancing point if it satisfies the condition that the amount of computation of anonymizing the data set to K anonymous required by MRTDS is equal to that by MRBUG A LGORITHM 2  ILPG  C ALCULATION M AP  Input Data record 007\010     005\010 anonymization level 026\027  NGSet  Output Intermediate key-value pair 8\013L  023C\031\014\032  1: For each attribute value 0 003 in  find its generalization in current 026\027  012\013\014 003 Let 022 003 be the parent in 012\013\014 003 and 023 003 be 0 003 itself or 022 003  child that is also 0 003 ancestor 2:  If 012\013\014 003 005 011>\013\032 emit 030 022 003 023 003 0210 035  023C\031\014\032  3: Construct quasi-identifier 002\003\004  030 002 1 002 2 002 034 035 where 002 003  E 022 003  if \012\013\014 003 is \007?\026\015\037\007FG 023 003 CH@H  I  1\036\003\036\034 Emit  030 002\003\004,M,N 035  023C\031\014\032  4: For each 003\005  1 034  replace 002 003 in 002\003\004 with its parent 022 003 if 002 003 023 003  producing the resultant quasi-identifier 002\003\004 4 emit  030 002\003\004 4 022 003 N 035  023C\031\014\032  A LGORITHM 3  ILPG  C ALCULATION R EDUCE  Input Intermediate key-value pair 8\013L  017\003\021\032\(\023C\031\014\032  Output Information gain 012\013\014 007\027\(\012\013\014 and anonymity 012\013\014  026 023  012\013\014   012\013\014  026 022 012\013\014 r generalizations 1: For each 8\013L  021\031\034 B  023C\031\014\032  2 For each key if 8\013LH 0210 O N update statistical counts 3    023 0210   B 021\031\034    023  B 021\031\034    023      022 0210 B\021\031\034    022 0210    022  B 021\031\034  P  022 P  4 If all sensitive values for child 023 have arrived, compute 007   023   5 If all children 023 of parent 022 have arrived, compute 007 022  and 007\027  012\013\014  emit 012\013\014 007\027\(\012\013\014  6 For each key if 8\013LH 0210  N update anonymity 7 If 8\013LH 023  M and 021\031\034  026 022 012\013\014 update current anonymity 026 022 012\013\014 B 021\031\034  8 If 8\013LH 023 O M  9:   If 021\031\034  026 023 012\013\014 update potential anonymity of 012\013\014  026 023 012\013\014 B 021\031\034  10 Emit 012\013\014  026 022 012\013\014 and emit 012\013\014  026 023  012\013\014

Once the workload balancing point K is identified, it is easy to choose which component to be employed. If 8QK MRTDS is selected because MRBUG will incur more computation, whereas MRBUG is selected if 8<K  Figuring out the exact value of K is difficult since K heavily depends on some properties of data sets, like data distribution and skewness. However, it is unnecessary to get the exact value because the performances of MRTDS and MRBUG make little difference when k is valued around K As such, we roughly estimate the value k according to the size of the data set and taxonomy trees B Workload Balancing Point Estimation To roughly estimate the workload balancing point, we assume that the values of an attribute are evenly distributed. Our basic idea is to estimate K according to the layering of taxonomy trees. Let H be the highest height among taxonomy trees. To facilitate the estimation, other taxonomy trees with height less than H are modified by making their height H A string of dummy nodes are attached to their leaf nodes, in order to increase tree height An example is demonstrated in Fig.2 to illustrate the above process. The tree 037\037 2 has the highest tree height two. As 037\037 1 has height less than two, dummy nodes dashed circles in the right part of Fig.2\ are added after modification. The height of modified version of 037\037 1 is also two The data records in a data set D are logically partitioned by the domain value nodes in taxonomy trees Let L j denote the j th layer of the taxonomy forest. The number of domain values of 037\037 003 on L j is denoted as N ij  The data set can be partitioned into R  0036 034 003=1 QI-groups in regard to the domain values on level L j For instance, the data set is partitioned into 4 groups \(2*2=4\ on L 1 in shown in Fig.2, and 8 groups \(2*4=8\ on L 2 Since we assume data sets are evenly distributed, the average anonymity of data set with respect to L j is K 6   010   R  0036 034 003=1 i.e., the average QI-group size To roughly identify K we narrow down the interval where K is located. Firstly, the computation required by MRTDS and MRBUG to achieve K 6 anonymous on level L j are estimated as follows. The performances of each round in both MRTDS and MRBUG are mainly dominated by the computation of the anonymity of data sets in the loop. Further, the computation required in one round of MRTDS and MRBUG, are roughly equal. Let C Unit denote the computation required in one round of MRTDS or MRBUG. In MRTDS, performing a specialization operation will launch IGPL update and incur C Unit computation. So, the total amount of computation to specialize D to L j denoted as 015 6 037\010 can be estimated by 015 6 037\010   015 S\014\003\032 T 003\017 034 003=1 6 017=1   4 In MRBUG, unlike MRTDS, performing a generalization operation possibly does not trigger ILPG update. Generally, several operations can launch ILPG update and incur C Unit computation. On average, we assume 1U V operations can do this, where 3\036U\0361  Then, the total amount of computation to generalize D to L j denoted as 015 6 9S\011 can be estimated by 015 6 9S\011   015 S\014\003\032 TWT 003\017 034 003=1 X'1 017=6  5 The value of j that make 015 6 037\010 equal to 015 6 9S\011 must be located in interval J 1 J  w h e r e  J satisfies the condition 015 Y 037\010 J\015 Y 9S\011 and 015 Y'1 037\010 036\015 Y'1 9S\011 Once J is identified, we can estimate that the workload balancing point K lies within K Y  K Y'1  L e t  Z be the average branch factor of the taxonomy forest. As K varies exponentially with respect to j where 1\0366\036X  we estimate the workload balancing point at the middle position between K Y and K Y'1 by the following formula K=K Y   010  T\(1 Z 034  6'1  V 1 Z 0346 V   6 Once the workload balancing point is estimated the hybrid approach can easily determine which component to be chosen, via comparing K with k anonymity parameter VI E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION A Experiment Settings To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the hybrid approach, we compare it with MRTDS a n d MRBUG. We denote the execution time of the three approaches as T Hyb  T TDS and T BUG respectively. In general T Hyb is similar to T TDS if k is larger than K while T Hyb is similar to T BUG if k is less than K Estimating K incurs overheads, yet it is minor compared with the computation conducted in MapReduce jobs Our experiments are conducted in a cloud environment named U-Cloud. U-Cloud is a cloud computing environment at University of Technology Sydney \(UTS The system overview of U-Cloud has been depicted in Fig.3 The computing facilities of this system are located among several labs in the Faculty of Engineering and IT UTS. On top of hardware and Linux operating system Ubuntu\ we install KVM virtualization software [28  which virtualizes the infrastructure and provides unified computing and storage resources. To create virtualized data centers, we install OpenStack open source cloud environment [29 w h i c h  i s r e s p o n s i bl e  for  vi r t ua l m a c h in e  management, resource scheduling, task distribution and interaction with users. Furthermore, Hadoop clusters [3  are built based on OpenStack to facilitate MapReduce computing paradigm and big data processing Figure 2 An example of modifying the height of taxonomy trees TT 1 TT 2 TT 1 TT 2 Original Modified L 0 L 1 L 2

All approaches are implemented in Java and standard Hadoop MapReduce API The Hadoop cluster consists of 20 VMs with type m1.medium which has 2 virtual CPUs and 4 GB Memory. Each round of experiment is repeated 20 times. The mean of the measured results is regarded as the representative. We utilize the Adult data set and its generated data sets like [12  B Experiment Process and Results We measure the change of execution time T Hyb  T TDS and T BUG with respect to anonymity parameter k The size of data set is set as 1000 MB Equally, the data set contains 1.1 002 10 7 data records, which is big enough to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of data volume or the number of data records. Parameter U is set as 0.5 Fig. 4 demonstrates the change of T Hyb  T TDS and T BUG with respect to k ranging from 0 to 1.1 002 10 7 For conciseness k is indicated by Exp which is the exponent of the scientific notation of k i.e k 1.1*10 Exp So Exp ranges from 0 to 7. We can see from Fig.4 that the execution time of the hybrid approach is kept under a certain level, while both MRTDS and MRBUG incur high execution time when k is small and large, respectively Further, the right part of the curve of T Hyb is near to T BUG  while the right part is near to T TDS  This is because the hybrid approach utilizes MRTDS and MRBUG as components to conduct concrete computation As a conclusion, the experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid approach significantly improves the performance of sub-tree anonymization over existing approaches regardless of the k anonymity parameter VII C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper, we have investigated the scalability issue of sub-tree anonymization over big data on cloud, and proposed a hybrid approach that combines Top-Down Specialization \(TDS\ and Bottom-Up Generalization BUG\ together. The hybrid approach automatically selects one of the two components via comparing the userspecified k anonymity parameter with workload balancing point. Both TDS and BUG have been accomplished in a highly scalable way via a series of deliberately designed MapReduce jobs. Experimental results have demonstrated that the hybrid approach significantly improves the scalability and efficiency of sub-tree data anonymization compared with existing approaches In cloud environment, the privacy preservation for data analysis, share and mining is a challenging research issue due to increasingly larger volumes of datasets, thereby requiring intensive investigation. Based on the contributions herein, we plan to further explore the next step on scalable privacy preservation aware analysis and scheduling on large-scale datasets R EFERENCES 1 S C h audh ur i  W ha t n e xt   A hal f doz en dat a m a nag e m e n t  research goals for big data and the cloud, Proc. the 31st Symposium on Principles of Database Systems \(PODS'12 pp. 1-4, 2012  L  W a ng, J  Z h an W   S h i  a nd Y  L i a ng I n c l o u d  c a n  scientific communities benefit from the economies of scale?, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, vol. 23, no. 2, pp. 296-303, 2012 3 H  T a ka bi  J  B  D  J o s h i and G  A hn  Sec ur i t y and pr i v acy  callenges in cloud computing environments, IEEE Security and Privacy, vol. 8, no. 6, pp. 24-31, 2010  B C.M  F ung K  W a ng, R.

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subows and can also handle short ows with efcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large benets over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufcient trafc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple renement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modied to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satised 1 It doesnt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satised it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafc through this path for the particular destination prex for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Buttery 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellysh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellysh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subows and modulating how much data is sent over different subows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modications We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafc patterns and show that it signicantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subows 69
