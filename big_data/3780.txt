Proceedmgs of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Xi\222an 2-5 November 2003 MINING CONDITIONAL HYBRID-DIMENSION ASSOCIATION RULES ON THE BASIS OF MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TRANSACTION DATABASE YAN XIN SHI-GUANG JU School of Computer Science and Telecommunications Engineering Jiangsu University Zhenjiang 2 120 13 iangsu, China E-MAIL kiqjannie@hotmail.com Abstract In this Paper we present such an idea 
of mining hybrid dimension association rules which meet the definite condition on the basis of multidimensional transaction database First we simply introduce the general algorithm for mining association rules Second, we give a brief analysis about the classical algorithm for mining single-dimensional association rules. Based on the analysis we stress on the discussion about how to expand and improve the algorithm, and then design an algorithm for mining hybrid-dimension association rules which meet the definite condition from multidimensional 
transaction database Last we give a simple example to explain the implement of the algorithm Keywords Apriori algorithm; Hybrid-dimension association rules Multidimensional transaction database Association rules 1 Introduction Originally the association rules were advanced for discovering the interesting association relationships among huge amounts of business transaction records. Association rule mining is a two-step process Find all frequent itemsets within transaction database Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets Among those, the searching for the frequent itemsets is the key step Because it\222s easy 
to generate rules from frequent itemsets nearly all the algorithms for mining association rules are designed on how to find the frequent itemsets more rapidly and more efficiently In 1993 221\221I  R Agrawal and some others presented the algorithm for mining the simplest form of association rules  single-dimensional single-level Boolean association rules It is called Apriori Algorithm The Apriori employs an iterative approach known as a level wise search to generate each frequent itemset However 
during the frequent itemsets generation we need proceed 0 0 with a great deal of repeated natural join That will bring abundant candidates Moreover it\222s necessary to repeatedly scan the database for finding frequent itemsets, which meet the minimum support count. Therefore the run-time of the Apriori will increase by index grade 12\222 with the increase of transaction item quantity From then on in order to improve the efficiency of the Apriori, many variations of Apriori algorithm have been proposed that focus 
on improving the efficiency of original algorithm In 1994 2213  R.Agrawa1 and some others presented the extending algorithm of the Apriori AprioriTid The AprioriTid employs the same thought to generate candidate itemsets But the difference is as follows When it scans the database repeatedly to count the support of candidates, the AprioriTid scan the whole transaction database only during the first time In later scanning a candidate transaction database formed in the last scan will substitute the original transaction database. Therefore the 
transactions need to be scanned are decreased dramatically the searching space of the transaction database is compressed and the implementation efficiency of the algorithm is improved drastically Besides the DHP algorithm based on the Harsh Technology was also presented as well as FP-tree algorithm-a kind of algorithm without candidate generation Anyway since R Agrawal and some others first presented the association rules mining the researchers have devoted to research all kinds of algorithm for mining association rules And many research achievements have been taken out As 
we know the Apriori was presented for single dimensional association rule mining It can only mine the relevancy among transaction items However when we come to the practical business application we need colligate the itemsets which built the business transactions with some other relevant information \(such as customers\222 information, information of the products\222\to proceed with the association analysis. Thus we obtain guidance to help the high-grade managers of the corporation to make some business decisions such as production decision, invention 0-7803-7865-2/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE 21 6 


Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 decision and sales decision If we take each database attribute or each Warehouse dimension as a predicate, we could divide association rules into two kinds--single dimensional rules and multidimensional rules according to the numbers of predication involved in the rules The single dimensional rules mainly deal with the intra dimension associations And the multidimensional rules deal with the inter dimension associations as well as intra dimension associations As for multidimensional association rules, we could hrther divide them into inter dimension association rules and hybrid-dimension association rules according to the show-up times of the predicate in the rules 0 Inter dimension association rules are the multidimensional association rules which have no repeated predicates, an example of such a rule is the following Age X,\22420.. .29\224 A occupation X,\224student\224 Here the predications \223age\224, \223occupation\224 and 223buys\224 0 Hybrid-dimension association rules are multidimensional association rules with repeated predications An example of such a rule is the following Age X,\22420 29\224 A buys \(X,\224laptop\224  buys X,\224printer\224 For the above analysis in this paper we present a thought that mines hybrid-dimension association rules on the basis of multidimensional transaction database. And we set definite condition restricts to the hybrid-dimension association rules mined When we design the hybrid dimension association rule mining algorithm we stress on the extension and improvement of the Apriori Algorithm the simple Single-dimensional mining algorithm. Therefore the following text will give a brief analysis to the Apriori  buys \(X,\224laptop\224 refer to three different attributes 2 The Apriori Algorithm The classical Apriori algorithm presented by R Agrawal and some others employ an iterative method to find all the frequent iemsets. First, the frequent 1-itemsets LI is found according to the user-specified minimum support threshold, then the L1 is used to find frequent 2 iemsets L2 and so on until there is no new frequent itemsets could be found After we find all the frequent itemsets using Apriori we could generate the corresponding association rules according to the second step in the process of association rules mining Thus we find the association relationships among transaction items The initial aim of the Apriori is to find the relevancy among the transaction items in the business transaction database Because these transaction items belong to the same attribute field in the transaction database, the Apiiori finds the relevancy among the different values of the same attribute That\222s so-called intra dimension association However when we proceed with the Hybrid-dimension association rules mining we need not only find relevancy among different values of the same attribute, but also find the relevancy among all the values of different attributes which is denoted inter dimension association. And we set definite conditional restrict to the hybrid-dimension association rules mined from multidimensional transaction database The restrict is in the rules the predicates represent the main attribute the attribute refers to the transaction itemset can occur many times but the other predications refer to subordinate attributes some other relevant attributes can only occur once Therefore to achieve our aim we make appropriate expansion and improvement to the traditional Apriori algorithm and design an algorithm for mining hybrid-dimension association rules which meet the definite condition from multidimensional transaction database 3 Conditional hybrid-dimension association rules mining The generation of frequent itemsets is the core of all the association rules mining algorithms We stress on this key part when we design the algorithm for mining hybrid dimension association rules 3.1 Improvement to joining process There are still two steps to generate of the frequent itemsets and frequent predicate sets we unify the appellation as frequent itemset in the following\The two steps are joining and pruning We make corresponding adjustment and improvement when proceed with joining 1 The join generating candidate 2-itemsets Cz We find frequent 1-itemsest based on each attribute, at the same time we mark items belong to every main attribute So we can say that the marked items are the items of main attributes and unmarked items are the subordinate items When we search for C2 if both of the two joining items are marked items we could proceed with intra-dimensional join between the items as well as inter-dimensional join but only proceed with inter-dimensional join on the other occasions 2\The join on other occasions When generate frequent itemsets directly according to 21 7 


the join mode of the Apriori it would occur intra dimensional join as well as inter-dimensional join But from the above analysis we know there are some restrictions to the generation of intra-dimensional join and inter-dimensional join Therefore we make the following modifications to the joining step of the Apriori Supposing 11 and 12 are itemsets in Lk-I the notation 141 refers to thejth item in li e.g  refers to the first to the last item in 11  By convention we assume that items within transaction and itemset are sorted in lexicographic order We could take two steps to find Lk  Differentiate the intra-dimensional join and inter-dimensional join the method is to make judgement before joining the two random k-1 itemsets If all the items within the two k-1 are belong to the main attribute we proceed with intra-dimensional join and proceed with inter dimensional join on other occasions 0 0 Implement join Ik-l Da Ik-l  and choose the corresponding joining condition according to the character of the join intra-dimensional join or inter-dimensional join If it\222s the inter-dimensional join it should meet the following condition The items from the 2th to the k-1 in 11 are the same as the items from the 1 th to the k-2 in 12 and l1[1]<l2[k-1 writing as joining form is as follows 1,[2]=12 13 n 1,[3]=12[2 n   n I1[k-l]=12[k 21 n Zl[1]42[k-l the joining result is ll[l]l2[1  12[k-2]l2[k-l If it\222s intra-dimensional join it should meet the condition The first \(k-2 items of 11 and 12 are in common writing as joining form is as follows 21 n l1[k-1]<l2[k-1 The condition ll[k-1]<12[k-1 simply guarantee against repetition. The joining result is 11 1]11[2  ll[k-l]Z2[k-1 I 1]=12 11 n 1/[2]=12[2 n    n ll[k-2]=lz[k 3.2 The compressing of transaction database In.the step of searching for frequent itemsets it need scan the whole transaction database to calculate the support count of candidates\222 In order to compass the transaction database being scanned and to improve the implementation efficiency of the algorithm we employ the method, which is presented by R Agrawal in his paper 13 to find association rules rapidly The main thought of this method is to find out the transactions including three more frequent 1 itemsets from the original business transaction set, after Proceedmgs of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 21 8 finding out frequent 1 itemssets Then rebuild business transaction database with these transactions. The rebuilt database is compressed and then the run-time will be shortened if we run the relevant algorithm on it 3.3 The conditional restriction in hybrid-dimension association rules After obtaining the frequent itemsets we can generate the hybrid-dimension association rules by the general method of generating association rules from the frequent itemsets. Because in the process of generating frequent itemsets we make both intra-dimensional join and inter dimensional join as well as the conditional restrictions of proceeding with joining all of the generated frequent itemsets have such a character the values within main attribute field occur many times while the values within subordinate attribute fields occur no more than one time Accordingly, the generated rules include many predicates and maybe include the same predicate So form the hybrid dimension association rules 4 Actualization of the algorithm According the above analysis we design the 1 Finding out frequent 1-itemset L1 2 Compass the original transaction database according to the located frequent 1 itemsets 3 Generate candidate 2-itemsets C2 from frequent 1 itemsets LI Here is the process Differentiate the two random frequent 1 itemset ll,l2\(ll,12 E Ll which are going to proceed with natural join If 1 and l2 are both subordinate attributes the join is not allowed and the connection is allowed on other occasions 4 Generate frequent 2 itemsets from candidate 2 itemsets 5 Start from frequent 2 itemset, take advantage of the iterative approach to generate frequent k-itemsets Lk from frequent k-1 k>3 Before making the natural joining to generate candidate k-itemsets Ck differentiate the intra-dimensional join from the inter dimensional join first then proceed with the join under certain condition following actualization flow of the algorithm 6 Generate association rules from frequent itemsets Figure 1 shows the logic flow of the improved Apriori Algorithm. Figure 2 and Figure 3 give the actualizing flow of the main process

single bond  aromatic bond single bOnd  aromatic bDnd d CBO Figure 9 Two fragments extracted from a sei of steroids On the left, single and aromatic bonds were treated as different bond types. on the right they were treated as the same bond type 3.4 Treatment of Aromatic Bonds An important aspect of molecular fragment mining is the treatment of aromatic rings Since ammaticity is not clearly defined and can be modeled differently i.e explicit aro matic bonds vs alternating single and double bonds it is desirable to be able to take it into account throughout the mining process itself We achieve this by modeling aro matic bonds as either single or double bonds with a flag that indicates aromaticity This allows us to choose to ignore this flag during mining and hence to find fragments that contain either aromatic or single resp double bonds The following example illustrates why this is desirable Using a small set of steroid compounds we derived frag ments that occur in ail of them support=100%\using the standard algorithm Figure 9 left shows the correspond ing fragment Note how only two rings with an incomplete third ring are discovered of the four ring structure that is typical for steroids However if we model aromatic bonds as single+flag and allow the algorithm to ignore this flag the resulting fragment contains all four rings see Figure 9 right For some steroids this fourth ring consists of sin gle bonds while others have an aromatic ring at this posi tion However most chemists still regard this as the same 4 ring structure Such selective 223tolerance\224 against some mis matches can therefore make the presented algorithm more useful for real applications 4 Conclusions We presented an algorithm to find relevant molecular frag ments in large chemical structure databases The algorithm allows us to focus on fragments that help to discriminate be tween different classes of molecules The underlying search method, which is based on a depth first search with struc tural pruning makes it possible to find such fragments effi ciently without the need for frequent reembeddings of frag ment candidates, which is a known problem of previously reponed approaches We have shown how the proposed method finds relevant fragments using data from a well known HIV-screening compound database The extracted fragments successfully model several of the activity classes known for this dataset Future work will focus on making the presented approach more meaningful for the underlying application In partic ular finding fragments that match exactly is not of prime interest to chemists As demonstrate above some types of ring structures are considered functionally equivalent which should be taken into account by the search algorithm as well We are currently exploring ways to include such 223fuzziness\224 into the underlying search algorithm directly References I R Agrawal T Imielienski and A Swami.

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
