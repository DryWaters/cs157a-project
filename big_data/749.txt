Virtual Communities: A Bibliometric Analysis   Mikko O. J. Laine Institute of Strategy and International Business/Software Business Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology mikko.laine@tkk.fi   Abstract  Virtual communities are a popular phenomenon today. They are significantly altering the specifics of how people work, spend their free time and interact socially. Moreover, they have been receiving growing attention in the academic literature. This study aims to identify and analyze the current academic literature in 
virtual communities using bibliometric analysis, and thus gain insight into its related body of knowledge Extracting data from the ISI Web of Science, the number of yearly publications, most productive authors and countries, cross-country collaborations and the varying scientific fields dealing with the multidisciplinary concept are identified, to name a few Article citation and co-citation analyses are conducted to distinguish the central works in virtual community literature. Finally, deriving from these analyses conclusions and research opportunities for further studies are discussed   1. Introduction  The nearly ubiquitous presence of the Internet has 
significantly changed the mechanisms of how people spend their free time and interact socially. This is happening more and more through virtual communities, which have become a very popular phenomenon today, especially amongst the young Some of the most popular virtual community services on the Internet, such as MySpace, Facebook and Habbo, can hold even in th e order of a hundred million registered users worldwide [45  Furthermore, virtual 
communities have received growing attention in the academic literatu This paper aims to identify the current state of this academic literature regarding virtual communities, and thus identify and analyze its knowledge base by using bibliometric analysis Where scientometrics is regarded as the measurement of scientific and technical research activity, bibliometrics is its sub-category, focusing primarily on the quantitative study of scientific 
publications for statistical pur poses [12  B i bliom e tric  methods serve the purposes of description, evaluation and scientific monitoring [2 prev iou s st u d ies  bibliometric analyses have been used to investigate, for example, the knowledge base of nanoscience and nanotechnology e tren ds an d con t ribu t i on s i n  RFID research e res ear ch in  v e n t u r e capital [7 and industry-academia collaboration in a specific field  T h e ben e f its a n d li m itati on s o f t h e m e t h odolog y  are discussed in the Limitations section This paper is structured in the following manner: In 
section 2 the method and data are described. It explains the search terms used for retrieving the data and tools used for analyzing it. Section 3 provides the results from the analyses, and a discussion on the limitations of the study. Finally, section 4 concludes the paper by providing a short summary of the paper and discussing viable avenues for further research  2. Method and data  ISI \(Institute for Scientific Information\ Web of Scien w a s us ed to con d u c t th e s earc h es a n d retrieve publication data. All three available citation 
index databases were used in the search: Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index and Arts & Humanities Citation Index. Together these databases cover thousands of major journals across hundreds of scientific disciplines, adding up to over 40 million searchable re T h ese citation indexes also contain a record of the references cited by the authors of the covered publications. This enables the use of cited reference searches and various citation analyses. Scientific journals indexed by ISI Web of 
Science databases include the most important and useful ones d a r e th u s repres e n tativ e of t h e bu l k  of the key scientific output [12, 24  Searching all of the three citation index databases was done in order to get a sense of all scientific disciplines and areas contributing to the research on virtual communities. In addition, ISI Web of Science search seems to merge duplicate results when Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


searching from multiple indexes, so there was no great fear of redundant data in the search results Various naming conventions are used to describe effectively the same phenomenon, for example virtual community l i n e c o m m uni t y 28], on l i n e  community d w e b bas e d com m u n i t y 1 Therefore, the final search string was formulated as  web based communit*" OR "on line communit OR "online communit*" OR "web communit*" OR computer mediated communit*" OR "virtual communit  Asterisk-characters were used to include singulars and plurals of each search term. The search was not limited to any specific years, thus retrieving everything from 1900 to 2008. No other restrictions were applied such as restricting the results to exclude book reviews All searches were performed on May 22 nd 2008 In ISI Web of Science, using a search string to search from Topic includes in the results hits in publication title, abstract, author keyword or Keyword Plus  fields. \(Keyword Plus  are words or phrases that frequently appear in the titles of a publication s references, but do not necessarily appear in the title of the publication or in a list of author keywords  This resulted in 848 hits, describing the whole corpus of publications mentioning the subject However, it was noticed that many publications resulted from false hits, for example publications that mention a virtual community in their abstract, but deal with a whole other subject such as Asian dust events The same search was performed, but was thereby restricted to only include hits from publication titles This resulted in a total of 317 hits after the removal of two false hits. These false hits are discussed in Limitations section among other limitations. The 317 publications contained over 6000 citations Many of the publication statistics were already reviewed and analyzed in ISI Web of Science by using the left menu named Refine Results with various filtering options. In addition, the Create Citation Report link was used to get detailed data on citations to the retrieved publications However, for further analyses, the search results were exported from the ISI Web of Science in text format as full records, including cited reference data meaning records of the references the publications cite\his data was then imported to a bibliometric analysis tool called Sitkis [34 Sitk is is a f r ee J a v a based program that utilizes Microsoft Access database to store and analyze data exported from the ISI Web of Science. Various analyses can be made with Sitkis using the exported data. After analyzing the articles Sitkis outputs the results in text format. These text files were then imported to UCINET 6, a social network analysis software, to make them drawable in NetDraw included with UCINET 6\etDraw was then used to draw the various network diagrams  3. Analysis and results  3.1. Publication statistics  There are two categories of bibliometric indicators descriptive indicators, and relational indicators having an analytical function s li sti n gs f r o m  publications are examples of descriptive indicators The number of publications per year is shown in Table 1. The first hit from year 1993 is a book review of Howard Rheingold s ground-laying book from the same year The virtual community: Homesteading on the electronic frontier   w h ic h coin ed t h e ter m  virtual community for the first time. Table 1 clearly shows the increase in the yearly number of publications concerning this area. However, there has been a decline from 2006 to 2007. Roughly extrapolating from the 2008 figure \(from May\ would indicate the possibility of a further decline   Table 1. Number of publications each year Publication year Nr. of publications  2008 12 3.8 2007 36 11.4 2006 40 12.6 2005 32 10.1 2004 27 8.5 2003 27 8.5 2002 24 7.6 2001 20 6.3 2000 20 6.3 1999 21 6.6 1998 15 4.7 1997 16 5.0 1996 6 1.9 1995 10 3.2 1994 10 3.2 1993 1 0.3 Total 317 100.0   Table 2 and Table 3 display the document types and languages of the search results, respectively. It can be seen that articles are the most common publication type in the search results. Naturally, this is due to the searched indexes mainly containing data from journals In addition, English was visibly the dominant language of all the publications  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2

USA collaborated only in 9% of its publications. Countries with less than 5 collaborations were not considered The institutions producing the publications are very dispersed, with only one institution \(University of Texas\ producing 6, and five other universities producing 4 publications. All other institutions produced 3 or less publications. Likewise, the source titles \(journals\where the publications have appeared are dispersed. 9 have appeared in the Journal of computer-mediated communication and other journals list only 6 or less publications. Authors producing the publications are distributed as well Preece, J. has authored in 7 of the publications, and 7 do not list an author at all. Lin, H.F. has authored in 4 publications, and all the other authors are listed in 3 or less publications. Again, it must be noted that naturally publications can list multiple authors and institutions Table 5 shows the subject areas of the publications The largest subject area is Information science library science but various computer science areas are also present. Business, management and a range of social sciences are also prominent. It is noteworthy that many of the subject areas contain words such as interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary in their names, giving affirmation to the multidisciplinarity of the virtual community concept, and how it is receiving attention from various academic disciplines  Table 5.

Interconnectedness of publications subject areas Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


Furthermore, it must be noted that many publications list several subject areas in their records The interconnectedness of the subject areas used concurrently in publications is shown in Figure 2. The sizes of the nodes represent the number of publications in the subject areas. The thickness of the lines represents the number of times these subject areas are listed together. An especially strong tie seems to exist between Information science & library science and Computer science, information systems  A multitude of keywords are used in conjunction with the search terms, further displaying the diversity in the topic. As with the search string, the terms appear in the keywords in various forms, such as singular and plural. These various writing differences were merged to create Figure 3, in which virtual community  online community and web community keywords were investigated. These keywords used are displayed in Figure 3. Thickness of the lines represents how many times a keyword has been used with one of the search terms These various naming conventions have been used interchangeably w e ver, it h a s been a s s e rted  that the term online community refers to computer networks or the Internet, and virtual community can exist via, for example, postal correspondence. The keyword analysis reveals that in fact the keyword Internet is often used in combination with the keyword online community The need to stress Internet along with a keyword that should imply it inherently does not give strong indication of it actually doing so in practice. In addition, the search terms are often used together as keywords, especially virtual community and online community  Table 6 displays the citations received by the publications, showing a steady yearly increase. Even though there has been a decline in the number of publications in this subject area, the citations received by these publications from other publications have been growing steadily. Extrapolating roughly from the 2008 figure \(from May\ would indicate continuing growth resulting in again the largest ever number of yearly citations received for year 2008. The most cited publications are listed in Table 7. A large number of received citations indicates recognition from peers in the scientific community and thus these publications can be deemed to be prominent works in the area   ACCESS RIGHTS ACC

Citation analysis  The ISI Web of Science citation indexes also record the citations to references made by listed publications By analyzing these citations, the influential works in this area can be identified Table 8 lists the most cited references, cited by the search result publications. Notable is that the majority of them are books, especially the ones in the top Publications that appear on both Table 7 and Table 8 that therefore are cited often by the search result publications and also by the non-search result publications, are Ridings, Gefen and Arinze 2002 [3  and Balasubramanian and Mahajan o m m   Pliskin and Clarke f r o m T a bl e 8 i s a l s o a  highly cited search result publication with 16 citations in total \(not shown in Table 7 Co-citation analysis is a relational bibliometric indicator, which provides a picture of scientific activity and helps in monitoring and identifying emerging research topics and the relevant contributors o citation analysis involves tracking pairs of papers that are cited together in the source publications, forming relations and clusters of research  Figure 4 shows the co-citation network of the most cited references. From the co-citation network it can be seen that an often co-cited triangle exists between the three most cited references: Rheingold 1993 [3  Preece 2000 [28 d Hag e l an d A r m s tron g 1997 [14     Table 7.

Limitations  Some limitations in this study must be considered The aforementioned false hits in the results were caused by the fact that ISI Web of Science does not understand some special characters in their search strings. A common naming convention is on-line community and thus searching with this term containing a hyphen \( - \aused problems. In fact these special characters are interpreted as spaces. In addition to special characters, ISI Web of Science search does not understand search words with less than three characters, even if they were typed inside quotation marks. Therefore, in this case the same results would have been attained with a search string line communit*". With this exact search string there were 14 results which were gone through by hand in order to include only results actually having on-line community in their titles. This resulted in the stated removal of two publications The full search string included popular naming conventions used to describe the same phenomenon but may have inherently missed more uncommon ones or some unusual combinations of these names Nevertheless, they might be argued to constitute only marginal additions to the list of searched publications and ultimately the results, especially regarding the cited references. On a further note, as cited references are identified through a set of publications retrieved by a search, defining the keywords for data searching does not restrict the breadth of works the result publications cite. Therefore, the cited references can have various titles and be from a range of fields It is important to note that the data was analyzed directly as how it was retrieved from the databases with the specified search string. However, there are numerous mistakes, typos and spelling errors in particular in the publications cited reference ISI simply reproduces the information provided by the authors in the publications. For example, for Howard Rheingold s book The virtual community Homesteading on the electronic frontier   multitude of reference codes were used, referring to the different editions of the book or just typing the book s title differently. These errors have affected the results that depend on the reference data. In the 317 publications there were over 6000 citations to references, and thus going through all the references manually to correct for these errors was deemed impossible. However, as the reference data has not been manually altered, the reproducibility is a lot higher, even though some of the results are skewed Questions have been raised about the use of first author s name in ISI Web of Scien A ll a u t h ors  names are listed in all the recorded publications whereas only the first author s name is used in the codes of the publications cited references. To know the exact reference a code represents, one needs to review the reference list of a publication that cites the reference There are several other common criticisms of the ISI Web of Science as the data source for bibliometric analysis, such as bias towards publications from USA bias towards English language, and the dependencies on journal impact factors w e v e r, t h e E n g lish language can be generally regarded as the dominant language of the research front, and recent studies have suggested that there is no bias towards USA publications as well as any other country  general, ISI Web of Science includes more than ten thousand highest impact research journals across various disciplines, hence covering most of the significant literature published in a given fi The search results of this study mostly consisted of journal articles. Therefore, for example, no monographs, conference proceedings, theses, technical reports, patents, books or book chapters were covered by the searches, although they also represent a part of the scientific discussion, especially in some fields Indeed, fields such as humanities and social sciences may have less comprehensive coverage, as journals may not be the main vehicles for academic dissemination in these fields  Older publications can logically have received more citations in total over the years than newer ones A derived, year-weighted citation count might be the solution to identify the recent, emerging but prominent works. In this fast-developing area older publications are also more likely to be outdated, therefore not necessarily accurately describing the cutting-edge of the research, or the phenomenon. Similarly, some journals can be upcoming and prominent, but may have not yet been covered in the databases due to their low impact factor, regardless of their importance in this field. No impact factors were used in analyzing the data of this study Overall, it must be emphasized that bibliometric analysis represents only one view of the scientific world seen through publications, not taking into account, for example, the informal communications or the tacit knowledge of researchers Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


4. Conclusions  In this paper, data extracted from ISI Web of Science s citation index databases was used to identify analyze and clarify the scientific body of knowledge of academic literature concerning virtual communities It was seen that the publication activity has been growing along with the citations received by the publications. The decline in publication activity in virtual community studies in Table 1 is an interesting phenomenon, which might signal a decline in academic interest toward the subject. On the other hand, there has been steady growth in the amount of citations these publications are receiving each year, shown in Table 6 The scientific fields contributing to the subject matter were numerous, generally consisting of various areas of computer science, business, and other social sciences. Many areas were multi- or interdisciplinary The dispersion or scatteredness of the literature was also displayed by author, institution, publication source and keyword diversities. Cross-country collaborations were elaborated on The most cited publications were identified, and reference citation and co-citation analyses revealed the most cited references, thus identifying the important works in the area and the citation links between them Of these works, many were books. The technologies and applications of virtual communities have been fastgrowing and changing, so there might not have been time or interest to do scientific articles to prominent journals, rather than more practitioner-oriented books that serve other purposes Limitations of the research were discussed. The various errors inherent in the data, caused by e.g different citation conventions, call for consistent practices for citing references in order to achieve uniformity in the citation data There are several avenues for further research Using the same data, various other analyses can be made, for example on co-authorship or on taking into account the impact factors of publication sources, i.e assessing the quality of the output. Subject areas could be weighted with publications received citation amounts or impact factors of their sources Furthermore, the longitudinal characteristics of the development of, for example, citations or subject areas could be investigated The identification of a corpus of publications also calls for a more qualitative systematic review of these publications. Systematic review is a thorough and unbiased methodology for doing literature review where the publications are classified and analyzed in-depth based on their contents [36, 18 T h es e characteristics coincide with the benefits of bibliometric analysis to conduct analyses in a transparent, reproducible manner. They can be seen as tools that are especially important nowadays in getting a grasp of the literature on a specific area with the rapid increasing of the total amount of published and easily accessible material   5.

Over the course of the early mission, the export function on the \223Overflight Review\224 was used for this purpose. After approximately two months of data had been collected the review page became unresponsively slow to load all the required data This was largely due to the amount of Javascript on the Review page.  So an additional page was added with the purpose of quick export to csv  General Query  Another important use of the RDE tool is ad-hoc analysis To meet this need, we provided a general-purpose query display.  This includes selection of any set of fields as well any number of SQL \223where\224 clauses.

  13  Use of Web Technologies The web development effort involved a long learning curve for some of the RDE Upgrade development team HTML We used HyperText Markup Language \(HTML\o layout the web framework and page structures AJAX/JSON  The AJAX \(asynchronous JavaScri pt and XML\tern was introduced to support a responsive web GUI.  An implementation of JSON \(JavaScript Object Notation provides the data service inte rface from the web client to a tomcat-maintained servlet. We have run into very few issues with this technology 10 11 12  CSS Cascading Style Sheets \(CSS\provide a straightforward way to manage web page styles. The language is well supported through the open-source FireBug Edito 14  JavaScript We used JavaScript to provide a rich interactive web interface, however our experien ce with JavaScript was not entirely favorable.   The Java Script \(JS approach to APIs including widgets led to our implementing more JS code than we might otherwise have.  We found the 223typeless\224 language occasionally caused confusion.  We did find that it could be \223made to provide\224 a rich web interface though probably a heavier interface than it needs to be.  One real positive for JS is the huge volume of sample code available on the Internet, saving time when dealing with the many implementation problems that spring up JasperReport  We used a toolkit called JasperReport to build a database report we could execute from our web interface.  A JasperReport is edited using the iReport tool. When the report is opened, the JasperSoft library is executed which updates each field from the database and presents the updated report The next section describes some of the \223analysis views\224 that can be generated from data in the RDE store 5  R ELAY A CCOUNTABILITY A NALYSIS  From the start of the Phoenix mission through the current day the RDE tool has been us ed primarily to extract pass statistics for reporting.  The key primary tracked statistic is the total volume of data delivered by each relay spacecraft Typically the \223Export Volumes\224 web view is used for a 223quick\224 export of these data, though the \223General Query\224 view can also be used for this purpose.  Raw tabular data are exported in Comma Separated Value \(CSV\at and then normally imported into an Excel spreadsheet for charting Figure 6 shows the total volume over time from the start of Phoenix mission \(Sol 0\o Sol 120, about a month past the end of prime mission Cumulative Return Link Data Volume 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000 0 30 60 90 120 Sol MRO Cumulative Ret Fill DV MRO Cumulative Ret PHX DV ODY Cumulative Ret Fill DV ODY Cumulative Ret PHX DV   Figure 6 \226 Cumulative Return Link Volume Figure 7 shows the same data values, but charted to show the total data volume transmitted per Sol  Return Link Data Volume by Sol PHX Lander Data + Fill Data 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 30 60 90 120 Sol ODY Ret Data Volume \(PHX Data + Fill bits MRO Ret Data Volume \(PHX Data + Fill bits  Figure 7 \226 Data Volume By Sol  On Figure 6 and Figure 7, the Phoenix Data Volume \(DV shown represents actual telemetry data and science product delivered.  The Fill DV on both figures represents \223fill\224 frames that are transmitted when a relay link is open but no actual lander data is available to transmit.  This chart shows that the Odyssey mission has carried the most part of 


  14 Phoenix relay data over MRO.  The low MRO volumes at the very early end of the chart are due to early MRO communications issues with Phoenix that were not resolved until later in the mission.  The volume discrepancies are clearly visible from both charts Figure 8 shows the data volumes for the 128K overflights as a function of Mars LMST \(Local Mean Solar Time 128 kbps Return Link Data Rate 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0:00:00 6:00:00 12:00:00 18:00:00 0:00:00 Local Mean Solar Time ODY MRO PHX Re q uirement:  30 Mb p ass  Figure 8 \226 Data Volume By Sol  Figure 9 shows a comparison of data volume predicts vs pass performance values  Figure 9 \226 Volume Predicts vs. Performance  6  C ONCLUSIONS  For ASC, the next step is to achieve a level of database independence.  We look to take advantage of emerging best practices technologies and patterns \(e.g. Hibernate  t o  upgrade our core server function to database independence and our Agent Framework to take advantage of a workflow execution function or language such as the Business Process execution Language \(BPEL  RDE is planned for update with the Mars Science Laboratory \(MSL\ission.  This will include any required updates to the planning input s \(MSL will utilize a wider range of relay parameters, including higher data rates multiple frequency channels and possibly new modulation and coding schemes and adaptive data rate functionality and a likely major change in the handling of predicts One significant additional RDE improvement proposed is to develop a web-based tactical interface supporting pass utilization requests and tacti cal updates.  Currently, all tactical relay coordination is accomplished via email and phone.  This process could be greatly improved with the upgrade to of a web-based system.  However, if adopted this upgrade would have a large impact on the current operational tactical process and thus must be carefully engineered across a broad user base  Overall we found we were able to accomplish our primary relay accountability goals using our chosen architecture The ASC server held up as a useful way to manage objectrelational transactions over a distributed network, and our event-driven client mechan isms were assembled in a straightforward manner using the existing ASC Agent Framework as well as the DOM message reactor function Our ability to accomplish this broad integration at a consistently low level of funding tells us that these technologies and patterns are worth pursuing as part of further accountability prototype pilot, and deployment activities A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  The work described in this paper was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Californi a Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  The authors wish to further acknowledge other individuals who made key contributions to research and development including Marti DeMore, Lloyd DeForrest, Derek Kiang Ashley Shamilian, Lori Nakamura, Mark Palm, Priscilla Parrish and Mike Tankenson
