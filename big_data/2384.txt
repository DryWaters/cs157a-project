INTRODUCTION\nUpon entering the 21st century, the global economic struc-\nture is transferring from “industrial economy” to “service\neconomy According to the statistics of the World Bank,\nthe output of modern service industry takes more than 60\npercent of the world output, while the percentage in developed\ncountries exceeds 70%. The competition in the area of modern\nservice industry is becoming a focal point of the world’s\neconomy development. Service computing, which provides\n?exible computing architectures to support modern service\nindustry, has emerged as a promising research area. With\nthe prevalence of cloud computing, more and more modern\nservices are deployed in cloud infrastructures to provide rich\nfunctionalities. The number of services and service users are\nincreasing rapidly. There has been enormous explosion in data\ngeneration by these services with the prevalence of mobile\ndevices, user social networks, and large-scale service-oriented\nsystems. The overwhelming service-generated data become too\nlarge and complex to be effectively processed by traditional\napproaches.\nIn information technology, big data has emerged as a\nwidely recognized trend, attracting attentions from govern-\nment, industry and academia. Big data are high volume, high\nvelocity, and/or high variety information assets that require\nnew forms of processing to enable enhanced decision mak-\ning, insight discovery and process optimization [1]. Men-\ntioned by the Compliance, Governance and Oversight Council\n\(CGOC, an organization focused on Information Governance most\norganizations and 90% of the data in the world has been\ncreated in the last two years [2]. In March 2012 the Obama\nadministration announced the big data research and develop-\nment initiative, which explored how big data could be used\nto address important problems facing the government. The\nleading IT companies, such as SAG Oracle, IBM, Microsoft,\nSAP and HP, have spent more than $15 billion on buying\nsoftware ?rms specializing in data management and analytics.\nThis industry on its own is worth more than $100 billion and\ngrowing at almost 10% a year, which is roughly twice as fast\nas the software business as a whole [3]. How to ef?ciently and\neffectively create values from the big data become an important\nresearch problem.\nThe emerging large-scale service-oriented systems often\ninvolve a large number of services with complex structures.\nThe big data generated from these systems are typically het-\nerogeneous, of multiple data types, and highly dynamic. Due\nto the fast increase of system size and the associated massive\nvolume of service-generated data, creating value in the pres-\nence of massive system and data becomes an inevitable chal-\nlenge. Examples of service-generated big data include trace\nlogs, Quality-of-Service \(QoS Similar to other types of big data, the service-\ngenerated big data initiatives span four unique dimensions 4]:\n\(1 even petabytes\nof information; \(2 service QoS prediction, could be\nachieved as data stream into the system; \(3 unstructured data are generated in various data types,\nmaking it possible to explore new insights when analyzing\nthese data together; and \(4 important to conduct trustable\nanalysis. Establishing trust in big data presents a huge chal-\nlenge as the variety and number of sources grows. These four\nunique characteristics of service-generated big data provide\ngreat challenge for data management and analysis.\nTo ful?ll the potential of service-generated big data, de-\nveloping exceptional technologies to effectively process large\nquantities of data within acceptable processing time is a critical\ntask. Moreover, easy access of the big data and the big data\nanalysis results are important. Big Data-as-a-Service encap-\nsulates various big data storage, management, and analytics\n2013

This paper provides\nan overview of service-generated big data and Big Data-as-a-\nService. First, three types of service-generated big data service\ntrace logs, service QoS information, and service relationship performance. Then, Big Data-\nas-a-Service \(BDaaS the service-generated big data and data\nanalysis results.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows Section\n2 provides an overview of this paper; Section 3 exploits\nservice-generated big data; Section 4 investigates Big Data-\nas-a-Service; Section 5 explores business aspects of service-\ngenerated big data and Big Data-as-a-Service and Section 6\nconcludes the paper.\nII. OVERVIEW\nFig. 1 provides an overview of the service-generated big\ndata and Big Data-as-a-Service. As shown in the ?gure, on the\none hand, we will introduce some typical applications which\nexploit three types of service-generated big data respectively\nfor system performance enhancement. First, log visualiza-\ntion and performance program diagnosis are investigated via\nmining service request trace logs. Second, QoS-aware fault\ntolerance and service QoS prediction are studied based on the\nservice QoS information. Finally, signi?cant service identi?ca-\ntion and service migration are achieved by investigating service\nrelationship. These concrete applications will shed some light\non the problem of big data analytics by mining the service-\ngenerated big data.\nOn the other hand, to provide user-friendly access to\nthe service-generated big data and various big data analytic\nresults, Big Data-as-a-Service will also be introduced as a\nbasic framework to store, manage and create value from the big\ndata. Fig. 1 illustrates the framework of Big Data-as-a-Service,\nwhich involves three layers, i.e., Big Data Infrastructure-as-a-\nService, Big Data Platform-as-a-Service, and Big Data Ana-\nlytics Software-as-a-Service. Via standard and programmable\nAPIs, Big Data-as-a-Service enables dynamic integration of\ndifferent big data and integration of different big data analytics\napproaches to create value from the service-generated big data.\nIII. SERVICE-GENERATED BIG DATA\nNowadays, there are all kinds of online services provided\non the Internet and daily used by millions of users. Every time\nwhen you perform a search, send an Email, post a microblog\nor shop on e-commerce Websites, you are generating a trace\nof data to the services.\nAs shown in Figure 2, as the number of services and\nusers scales up, the service-generated data \(including service\nlogs, service QoS information, and service relationship phenomenon. With the\nincreasing volume of service-generated big data, how to create\nvalues from the data becomes an important research problem.\nThe following sub-sections will describe in detail how the\nservice generated data can be processed and analyzed to\nenhance system performance.\nA. Service Trace logs\nWith the popularization of large-scale service-oriented sys-\ntems, and the number increasing of service users \(e.g PCs,\nmobile devices, etc day. There are billions of\n404\n \b\t\n  \b\t\n \n \b\t\n   \b\t\n \n \f t\n \t \n \b\t\n \n \t \n \t \nFig. 2. Service-generated Big Data\ndaily logs, log ?les, and structured/unstructured data from a\nwide variety of service systems. For example, an Email service\nprovided by Alibaba \(one of the biggest e-commerce company\nin the world produce about 30-50 gigabytes \(around\n120-200 million lines  utilized both in the development stages and in normal\noperations for understanding and debugging the behavior of\nthe complex system.\nAs the scale and complexity of distributed systems rapidly\nincrease, large-scale distributed systems like cloud computing\nsystems typically involve a large number of interactions be-\ntween service components, in some cases across hundreds of\nmachines, which makes it very dif?cult to manually diagnose\nthe performance problems. By the way of mining these service-\ngenerated trace logs, valuable information can be obtained to\nhelp service designers and developers understand and improve\nthe quality of systems. For example, performance bottleneck\nlocalization can be achieved by analyzing the trace 


logs.\nHowever, there are still many challenges to be addressed. On\none hand, the huge volume of service-generated trace logs\nmake performance diagnosis labor-intensive; on the other hand,\nthe demand for real-time system diagnosis is ever increasing.\nThis section discusses how to investigate the trace logs to\n?nd the value hidden in it, including trace log visualization\nand performance problem diagnosis\n1 visualization: Distributed systems are contin-\nuously growing in scale and service component interactions It\nis becoming dif?cult for the system designers and administra-\ntors to understand the characteristics of system performance.\nRequest tracing approaches, which are widely adopted by\ncompanies such as Google [6 Microsoft [7] and eBay [8],\nrecord the execution information of requests \(e.g., entering\nand leaving time when individual requests go through service\ncomponents system designers and administrators. Log visualization\nprovides tools for abstract visualization of log ?les or results\nof log queries  trace logs, ef?cient\nlog visualization of become an challenge research problem.\nTo address this problem, a number of approaches have been\nproposed. Stardust [10] uses relational databases as repository\nwhich suffers poor query ef?ciency in the environment of\nmassive data volumes. P-tracer [11] is an online performance\npro?ling tool to visualizes multi-dimensional statistical in-\nformation to help administrators understand the system per-\nformance behaviours in depth. DTrace [12] and gprof [13]\nvisualize the execution of systems as call graphs to signify\nwhere requests spend time.\nAlthough a number of previous research investigations\nhave been conducted at service log visualization, this research\nproblem becomes more challenging in the scenario of big data,\ncaused by the rapid increase of log ?les, the unstructured\nlog data and the requirement of real-time query and display.\nMore research investigations are needed to enable real-time\nprocessing and visualization of the huge volume of trace logs.\n2 today’s distributed\nsystems, especially the cloud systems, a service request will\ngo through different hosts invoking a number of software\nmodules. When the service cannot satisfy the promised service\nlevel agreement SLA e.g., an invoked method performance problem in a timely manner. Trace logs\nprovide valuable information to ?nd the cause of performance\nproblems. How to exploit the tremendous trace logs effectively\nand ef?ciently to help designer understand system performance\nand locate performance behaviours becomes an urgent and\nchallenging research problem.\nIn recent literature, a large body of research work has\nbeen investigated to address this problem For example, Mag-\npie [14], Pip [15] and Ironmodel [16] are application-speci?c\napproaches, which require domain knowledge to construct\nthe performance diagnosis models. Pinpoint [17] employs\nclustering algorithm to group failure and success logs. Dap-\nper [6] employs Bigtable to manage the large volume of trace\nlogs. Data mining technologies such as principal component\nanalysis \(PCA are\nalso employed for identifying performance bottlenecks via\nmodeling and mining the trace logs [5 18].\nHowever, the large volume and high velocity of service-\ngenerated trace logs make it very dif?cult to perform real-\ntime diagnosis. Most of the previous solutions suffer from low\nef?ciency in handling large volume of data. More ef?cient\nstorage, management, and analysis approaches for service-\ngenerated trace logs are required.\nB. Service QoS information\nThe current large-scale distributed platforms \(e.g., various\ncloud platforms these\nservices are recorded, in both server-side and user-side. Since\ndifferent users may observe quite different QoS performance\n\(e.g., response-time larger than that of server-side QoS data.\nMoreover, QoS values of service components are changing\ndynamically from time to time, resulting in explosive increase\nof user-side service QoS information.\nValuable information can be obtained through investigating\nthese user-side service QoS information in order to enhance\nsystem performance, for example, to achieve adaptive fault\ntolerance and to make personalized QoS prediction for users.\n405\n1 original services\nmay be disabled, new services may be added, and QoS of\nthe services may change from time to time. Building reliable\nservice-oriented systems is much more challenging in this\nhighly dynamic environment compared with the traditional\nstand-alone software systems. Software fault tolerance [19] is\nan important approach to build reliable systems via employing\nfunctionally-equivalent components to tolerate faults. On the\nInternet, the functionally-equivalent Web services provided\nby different organizations can be employed to build fault-\ntolerant service-oriented systems. When designing fault tol-\nerance strategies, service QoS information can be considered\nto enhance the performance.\nThe huge number of services in the large-scale distributed\nplatforms is monitored continuously at runtime. Large volume\nof QoS data \(e.g., response-time availability, throughput, etc 


record the QoS of the invoked services. How\nto ef?ciently and effectively process these large volume of\nservice QoS data to design fault tolerance strategies which can\nadapt to the dynamic environment for optimal performance is\na challenging research problem.\nIn our previous work [20], a preliminary middleware has\nbeen designed for fault-tolerant Web services. However, this\nmiddleware did not provide a personalized fault tolerance\nstrategy for different users. In the dynamic Internet envi-\nronment, server-side fault tolerance is not enough since the\ncommunication connections can fail easily. Personalized user-\nside fault tolerance needs to be considered. Moreover, to\nspeedup the analysis and computation of the large volume of\nservice QoS information, online learning algorithms [21] will\nneed to be investigated for incremental update of the fault\ntolerance strategy when new QoS values become available.\n2 QoS prediction aims at\nproviding personalized QoS value prediction for service users,\nby employing the historical QoS values of different users.\nWeb service QoS prediction usually includes a user-service\nmatrix where each entry in the matrix represents the value of\na certain QoS property \(e.g., response-time service\nobserved by a service user. The user-service matrix is usually\nvery sparse with many missing entries since a service user\ntypically only invoked a small number of Web services in the\npast. The problem is how to accurately predict the missing QoS\nvalues in the user-service matrix by employing the available\nQoS values After predicting the missing Web service QoS\nvalues in the user-service matrix, each service user can have a\nQoS evaluation on all the services, even on the unused services.\nAs a result, optimal service can be selected for users to achieve\ngood performance.\nIn service computing, Web service QoS prediction has at-\ntracted a lot of attention in recent years. A number of QoS pre-\ndiction approaches have been proposed to address this paper,\nincluding user-based QoS prediction approach [22], combina-\ntion of user-based and item-based approaches [23], ranking-\noriented approach [24], clustering-based approach [25], etc.\nSome recent work [26], [27] further considers the locations\nof Web services and service users to enrich the context\ninformation of the service environment and thus improve\nthe prediction quality. However, with the rapid increasing of\nWeb services and users, the size of user-service matrix is\nbecoming larger and larger which makes it not ef?cient for\nreal-time prediction. Since the Internet environment is highly\ndynamic services may add or drop at anytime, so enhancing\nthe robustness of QoS prediction approaches \(e.g., solving the\ncold-start problem e.g response time Thus, how to ef?ciently process the large\nvolume of available service QoS data and accurately predict\nthe missing QoS values in the huge user-service-time matrix\nbecomes a very challenging research problem.\nC Service relationship\nNowadays, large-scale distributed systems typically involve\na large number of service components. These service com-\nponents are typically deployed in distributed computer nodes\n\(i.e., physical machines or virtual machines dynamic\nWeb content for a page in one of the e-commerce sites in\nAmazon, each request typically requires the page rendering\ncomponents to construct its response by sending requests to\nover 150 services [28]. These components are interdependent\nbetween each other. The invocation relationship among service\ncomponents can be modeled as a weighted directed graph,\nwhere a node in the graph represents a service component\nand a directed edge from one node to another represents a\ncomponent invocation relationship. The weight at each edge\nmay be expressed as the cost or the frequency of the invocation.\nThis service invocation graph can be updated dynamically at\nruntime, caused by reasons such as service add/drop, service\nmigration, load balance, etc.\nBy exploiting the service invocation graph, valuable infor-\nmation can be obtained to identify signi?cant service compo-\nnents and to enable better dynamic service migration.\n1 Relia-\nbility of different service components may impose different\nimpacts on the service-oriented system. By investigating the\nservice invocation graph, the signi?cant service components\n\(e.g., core components or weak components how to improve the reliability of the\nsystem. For example, additional fault tolerance strategies can\nbe designed for these signi?cant service components to achieve\nhigher reliability. However, due to the nature of dynamic\ncomposition of service components, the service invocation\ngraph can be continuously updated at runtime. And the trend\ntowards large-scale systems make the service invocation graph\nquite large and complex Stochastic ranking techniques can be\nemployed to identify the signi?cant service component in the\ngraph for a distributed system.\nIn our preliminary investigation [24], we considered a\ncomponent signi?cant if it is invoked by many other important\ncomponents frequently, and proposed a random walk based\napproach to identify signi?cant components in a cloud sys-\ntem. Besides, Liu et al. [29] propose to exploit the service\nrelationship to assist the reputation computation of services,\nwhich further improve the robustness of 


the system. However,\nthere are still a lot of research problems to be addressed,\n406\nfor example: \(1 the relationship between different\nservice components \(e.g., components a and b invoke the\nsame component c then there is implicit relationship between\ncomponent a and b 2 whole system, which can help us improve the robustness\nof whole system; \(3 effective\napproaches to build and analyze the service invocation graph\nand identify signi?cant service components.\n2 which need to be\ndeployed to distributed nodes \(i.e., physical machines or virtual\nmachines service environment is highly dynamic,\nafter the initial deployment, it is essential to optimize the\nservice deployment strategy among candidate nodes period-\nically to achieve optimal overall system performance while\nminimizing the operational cost. As a result, dynamic service\nmigration is in need by moving the service from one physical\nmachine to another at runtime. It is a common practice in many\ncommercial cloud platforms.\nBy modeling and exploiting the service invocation relation-\nship and past service usage experiences, a proper migration\nof the services can improve the experience for existing users.\nIn our previous work [30], a preliminary model has been\nformulated based on integer programming to make an optimal\nredeployment of services. However, this integer programming\nbased model suffers from the scaling problem when facing\na large number of services and candidate nodes. This model\nis further improved in [31] by taking service relationship into\naccount, which proposes to use a genetic algorithm to solve the\nmodel ef?ciently. With the proliferation of cloud federation,\nsome other work \(e.g., [32], [33], [34 considers the\ndynamic service deployment and migration in geographically\ndistributed clouds to get optimal the service performance.\nTo cope with the growing size of the service migration\nproblem, more ef?cient approaches are needed. For exam-\nple, \(1 locations of service users can be considered\nto further improve the migration performance; \(2 prediction techniques, network latencies among service\ncomponents and between users and services can be predicted\nto achieve better service migration performance; \(3 migration strategy, instead\nof integer programming, various machine learning algorithms,\nsuch as online learning, and k-median optimization model,\ngenetic algorithm, etc., can be investigated to enable ef?cient\nservice migration.\nIV. BIG DATA-AS-A-SERVICE\nThe value of data has been widely recognized. Data can be\nanalyzed for a lot of purposes, such as enhancing system per-\nformance, guiding decision making, assessing risk, trimming\ncosts, lifting sales, and so on [35]. Traditionally, such kinds\nof data analysis tasks are conducted separately by different\norganizations, although these tasks include a lot of common\nsteps, such as information extraction, data cleaning, modeling,\nvisualization, and so on. With the increasingly large amount\nof data, building separate systems to analyze data becomes\nexpensive and infeasible, caused by not only the cost and\ntime of building the systems, but also the required professional\nknowledge on big data management and analysis. Therefore,\nit is necessary to have a single infrastructure which provides\ncommon functionality of big data management, and ?exible\nenough to handle different types of big data and big data\nanalysis tasks 36].\nBig Data-as-a-Service provides common big data related\nservices to users to enhance ef?ciency and reduce cost. As\nshown in Figure 1, it typically includes three layers, i.e., big\ndata infrastructure, big data platform, and big data analytics.\nThese three layers in Big Data-as-a-Service provide different\nlevel of abstractions to users, where Big Data Infrastructure\nprovides the most basic services and the higher layers provide\nmore advanced services. Although cloud is a nature architec-\nture for Big Data-as-a-Service, the service is not limited to\njust cloud architecture. Other distributed architecture can also\nbe employed to host the big data services. Section IV-A to\nSection IV-C provide details discussions on these three layers\nof Big Data-as-a-Service, respectively.\nA. Big Data Infrastructure-as-a-Service\nScale-out infrastructure provides necessary computing and\nstorage capacity for big data. Big data infrastructure can\nleverage Infrastructure-as-a-Service \(IaaS Computing-as-a-Service,\nto store and process the massive data. Although current\ntechnologies such as cloud computing provide infrastructure\nfor automation of data collection, storing, processing and\nvisualization, big data impose signi?cant challenges to the\ntraditional infrastructure, due to the characteristics of volume,\nvelocity and variety. Modern Internet and scienti?c research\nproject produce a huge amount of data with complex inter-\nrelationship. These big data need to be supported by a new\ntype of Infrastructure tailored for big data, which must have the\nperformance to provide fast data access and process to satisfy\nusers’ just in time needs [37]. Moreover, community standards\nfor data description and exchange are also crucial [38].\nOne of the challenges of designing big data infrastructure is\nthe requirement to support many different data types, not only\nthe existing data types but also the new types that are emerging.\nMoreover, the big data 


infrastructure needs to support reuse\nand share of the big data. For example, allowing researchers to\nlink their scienti?c results with the initial data and intermediate\ndata to allow future re-use/re-purpose of the data [39]. Flexible\naccess control of the big data is thus required.\nDifferent from traditional IaaS in cloud computing, in big\ndata infrastructure, the technologies for processing big data\nhave to combine with storage designs [40]. For example, the\nservice-generated big data are generated by Internet services,\nwhich are typically deployed in cloud infrastructures. Due to\nthe huge volume of data, it is inevitable that both data and data\nanalytics approaches need to be closely located to reduce the\nunnecessary network traf?c, remove performance bottleneck,\nand enhance ef?ciency. Therefore, it is common to develop\nand deploy big data analytics approaches at the same cloud\ninfrastructure to provide enhanced service offerings.\nB. Big Data Platform-as-a-Service\nA big data platform allows users to access, analyze and\nbuild analytic applications on top of large data sets [41].\n407\nOne example of Big Data Platform-as-a-Service is Google’s\nBigQuery1, which let users take advantage of Google’s massive\ncompute and storage power to analyze Big Data and get real-\ntime business insights in seconds via REST interface. BigML2\nis another big data PaaS example, which offers a highly\nscalable cloud based machine learning service that is easy to\nuse, seamless to integrate and instantly actionable. Big data\nplatforms typically include multiple modules, such as analysis\ntask speci?cation, data storage and management, data process\nand integration, discovery and visualization, and so on.\nIn a big data platform, the big data analysis typically\nincludes multiple steps. For certain steps, APIs provided by\nthe big data platform can be employed to conduct common\nprocessing on the data. For other steps, the users need to de?ne\ntheir own speci?ed processing and analysis rules, which re-\nquires the big data platform to be ?exible enough in expressing\nvarious kinds of big data analysis tasks. Appropriate high level\ndeclarative language is required to specify different user tasks.\nThe challenges of designing such kind of language include\nnot only the seamless integration of different steps \(such as\nplatform-provided APIs and user-de?ned analysis tasks but\nalso the consideration of data locations to enable ef?cient data\nmanagement, aggregation, and analysis.\nAt the big data platform, there are different ways for\ndata storage and management, including cloud storage Data-\nas-a-Service \(DaaS DBaaS  differences between\nthese different ways can be summarized as follows:\n• Cloud Storage \(e.g., Amazon S3 Dropbox, etc storage device.\n• DaaS \(Data-as-a-Service allow controlled\naccess to the data through Web API \(e.g., RESTful\nWeb service DaaS cannot\nbe accessed via languages such as SQL. DaaS is\nsuitable only for basic data management querying\nand manipulation. One example of DaaS is Google’s\npublic data service that provides access to all sorts of\ndata provided by public institutions3.\n• DBaaS \(Database-as-a-Service service, which can be accessed via pre-\nde?ned common sets of APIs. The provided database\nservices can be traditional relational databases,\nNoSQL data stores, in-memory databases, and so on.\nNowadays, users are accessing multiple data storage plat-\nforms to accomplish their operational and analytical require-\nments 43]. Ef?cient integration of different data sources is\nimportant. For example, an organization may purchase storage\nfrom different vendors and need to combine data with different\nformat stored on systems from different vendors [37]. Data\nintegration, which plays an important role for both commercial\nand scienti?c domains combines data from different sources\nand provides users with a uni?ed view of these data [44].\nHow to make ef?cient data integration with the 4V volume,\n1https://cloud.google.com/products/big-query\n2https://bigml.com/\n3http://www.google.com/publicdata\nTA BLE I.

This indicates\nthat DCA can ?nd a data point closer to the actual anchor\nthan the two methods, when the noise is too large to allow\nany algorithm to ?nd the real anchor Furthermore, the\nresults show two vital advantages of DCA: 1 huge complete\nset \(of size 124750 for Figure 3 and 100 for Figure 4 This is consistent\nwith our theoretical analysis in Section 2D; and, 2 even when it is run by a\nsingle thread. It can be expected that a parallel or distributed\nDCA is able to provide a substantially ef?cient algorithm\nthat cannot be offered by any previous method for big data\nchallenges.\nIn the incomplete data case, DCA exhibits remarkable\ncapability and successfully locates most anchors even when\n90% entries in the matrix are missing and the rest observed\nones are corrupted by relatively large noise. Note there\nare merely 125 sub-problems involved in the divide step\nof DCA. This indicates that DCA does not use all the\ninformation encoded in the observed entries, and can still\nachieve promising performance. Compared to similar plots\nreported in matrix completion \(MC   out that the sampling ratio required by DCA to\nrecover anchors are much less than that required by MC to\nrecover the matrix. But their goals in massive applications\nare identical, i.e., to represent a huge number of data points\nby a few basis. This means DCA can replace MC in various\nsituations \(analogous to the relation between PCA and CUR\n[18 improves with the increase\nof rank, which is opposite to what we usually observed in\nMC. This is interpretable, because to select a fewer anchors\nfrom a great number of data points and ensure that they can\nexpress the whole dataset is much dif?cult than to pick out\nmore redundant data points, which can easily lead to a small\nreconstruction error. Hence more information from data is\nrequired in the former case.\nB Collaborative Filtering by Finding Representative Users\nWe show an interesting application of DCA in recommen-\ndation systems, which were mentioned in Section 2C and\ncannot be handled by other separable NMF. In particular,\nwe assume that there exist some representative users whose\nratings’ conical combination is able to express all the other\nusers’ ratings.

desired\nlevel of accuracy by simply increasing the number of steps.\nIn particular, any of Messac’s canonical satisfaction function\ncan be modeled [31].\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can enter\none-of-a-kind requirement satisfaction rules. However, a\nspreadsheet-based user interface was implemented for rapid\ncoding of multi-step satisfaction functions, which have all the\nsame structure.\nStep 3a Aggregate Requirement Satisfaction—The prefer-\nence domain is hyperdimensional because there is at least one\ndimension per requirement, and in a complex system there\ncan easily be several hundreds or even thousands of require-\nments. Dominated architectures could easily be eliminated\nby means of Pareto analysis, but this is unlikely to reduce\nthe size of the tradespace by much due to the large number\nof requirements. Hence, the problem remains of choosing\nbetween architectures that have very different requirement\n10\nFigure 10. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3a: Aggregate satisfaction\nsatisfaction sets, but seem globally equally attractive. In prac-\ntice, the dimensionality of this domain needs to be reduced in\norder to be able to make a decision concerning the preferred\narchitectures. This requires the use of subjective information\ncapturing stakeholder preferences.\nHence, the last step of the methodology is the reduction of the\ndimensionality of the preference domain through aggregation\nof requirement \(i.e., subobjective then into stakeholder satisfaction. This two-\nstep aggregation process requires the elicitation of a list of\nobjectives and subobjectives from different stakeholders, and\nreduces the dimensionality of the preference domain \(i.e., the\nnumber of metrics Nsh\nto 1 if the relative importance of stakeholders to a central\nstakeholder is introduced. The relative importance of stake-\nholders can be formally computed by applying quantitative\nstakeholder analysis techniques e.g. stakeholder networks\n[32 represents the value of the system\narchitecture to the central stakeholder. The entire process is\nillustrated in Figure 10.\nMathematically, requirement aggregation rules reduce the\ndimensionality of the satisfaction space by using aggregation\nfunctions. Aggregation functions combine arithmetic and\nlogical operators. The simplest and most commonly used\narithmetic operator is the weighted average. For example, the\nsatisfaction of a stakeholder is given by a weighted average\nof the satisfaction of its objectives. More sophisticated arith-\nmetic operators are also possible \(see for example Yager’s\nordered weighted averaging operator or Fortin’s gradual num-\nbers [33], [34 type, such as the at-least-n-out-of-\nk condition: “the stakeholder is satisfied if 3 or more of these\n4 objectives are satisfied.”\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can man-\nually define one-of-a-kind aggregation functions. Weighted\naverages can be rapidly coded in from a spreadsheet-based\nuser interface.\nStep 3b: Prepare Explanations—The VASSAR methodology\nprovides a set of explanations that accompany the fuzzy value\nmetric. This is central to the methodology, as it satisfies one\nof its key requirements, namely that of showing traceability\nof the value delivery loop. Explanation rules keep track of\nTable 3.

CASE STUDY\nWe selected a hypothetical soil moisture remote sensing\nsatellite mission as the case study to show the applicability\nthe VASSAR methodology. This hypothetical mission would\ncombine instruments that are similar to real instruments flown\nor to be flown in NASA and ESA missions References to\nthese missions will be made as required. This example was\ndesigned to illustrate different features of the methodology:\n\(1 elements of subjectivity, which are hard to\nmodel in traditional design tools;\n\(2 emergent behavior that actu-\nally drives an important part of the value delivery;\n\(3 of complexity, as it is complex\nenough to yield non-trivial results, but simple enough to avoid\nthe need to provide excessive background.\nPayload description\nFor this example we consider five candidate instruments:\na an L-band polarimetric radiometer \(LRADIO synthetic\naperture radar \(LSAR XRADIO IR P-band polarimetric\nSAR \(PSAR mass, power data rate, performance tradespace\nFor this example, we chose to represent an architecture as\nthe set of decisions laid out in Table 


3. The set of possible\narchitectures is given by the Cartesian product of the ranges\nof values in Table 3 which consists of 3,636 architectures.\n11\nFigure 11. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3b: Prepare explanations\nStakeholder requirements\nFive stakeholder groups or panels were identified for this\nexample, labeled as follows: weather climate, ecosystems,\nwater, and applications. All five panels were initially con-\nsidered equally important; a case with non-uniform weights\nis considered later in the sensitivity analysis. Note that the\npanels’ relative weights could be obtained through a formal\nmethod such as the one proposed by Cameron et al [32].\nThe specific objectives of each panel, as well as their relative\nranking, are provided in Appendix B.\nCapability rules\nNominal instrument capabilities are presented in Appendix\nA. However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters. Below are\na few examples of situations in which data quality is severely\ncompromised due to orbital parameters.\nLighting conditions—Visible and NIR instruments \(namely\nthe corresponding channels of the IR radiometer node because they cannot gather\nenough light.\nImage distortion—Side-looking instruments cannot work at\nlow altitudes because image distortion becomes unaccept-\nable.\nEmergence rules\nEmergent behavior plays a key role in value delivery to\nstakeholders. We describe in this subsection a few examples\nof emergent behavior \(both in science and cost spatial\nresolution soil moisture dataset provided by LRADIO can be\ncombined with the lower accuracy, higher spatial resolution\ndataset provided by LSAR to produce a new high accuracy,\nmedium spatial resolution dataset.\nSample averaging—In any dataset, part of the non-systematic\nerror can be reduced by averaging samples in time or space,\nthus effectively creating a new dataset that trades accuracy\nagainst spatial or temporal resolution.\nLevel-4 data products—A level-4 net carbon ecosystem ex-\nchange dataset can be created from the combination of a\nlevel-3 soil moisture dataset and several ancillary products,\nnamely land surface temperature, vegetation state, and land-\ncover status.\nMultispectral measurements—IR and MW snow and ice cover\ndatasets can be combined to produce new, multispectral, more\naccurate datasets.\nSharing a common dish—The L-band radar and radiometer\ncan share a common antenna thus effectively reducing the\ntotal mass of the system.\nLearning Curve—If several identical satellites are developed\nand fabricated, the marginal cost of the second and subse-\nquent units is lower than the cost of the first unit due to\nlearning.\nResults\nThe set of 3,636 architectures was evaluated using VASSAR.\nThe benefit portion is based on the set of requirements from\nAppendix B. The cost portion is based on the cost model de-\nscribed in Appendix C. The point science scores and lifecycle\ncost estimates for all these architectures are shown on Figure\n12. These numbers are obtained from defuzzyfying the fuzzy\n12\nFigure 12. Expected science vs expected lifecycle cost for\n3,636 architectures \(uniform weights analysis—The main goal of any system architect-\ning tool is to gain insight into the “shape” of the tradespace,\nwhat the main trades are, whether there are families of\narchitectures, and so on. We observe several features just by\nlooking at the tradespace in Figure 12:\n\(1 a science score\nof 0. This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate. An example of the latter is when a side-\nlooking instrument is put at 400km, resulting in a too large\nimage distortion.\n\(2 unresolvable conflicting require-\nments. In this particular case, most of the observations\nrequire a SSO in order to get rid of diurnal variations in radi-\nance. However, a small subset of requirements that concern\noceanography or cryospheric measurements are ideally taken\nin true polar, non-SSO orbits, in order to avoid tidal aliasing\n\(oceanography cryosphere it is impossible to be in a polar\nand SSO orbit simultaneously, some value is going to be lost\nno matter what decision is made.\n\(3 costs. This is a typical behavior in\narchitectural tradespaces, that has its origins in the non-linear\nmapping between capabilities and satisfaction, namely in the\nquantization of satisfaction levels. In other words slightly\ndifferent performances may be perceived as equivalent in\nterms of satisfaction by stakeholders.\nExplanation facility—The explanation facility provides sup-\nport for more advanced analysis of the tradespace. Examples\nof the features of the explanation facility are listed below:\n\(1 The explanation facility provides\ndetailed explanations of the scores of an architecture in text\nformat as required by the user. An example of such informa-\ntion is provided in Table 4.\n\(2 support: The explanation facility\ncan provide information about one or more architectures on\nFigure 13 


Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy results—We emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., “Most” or “Some larger.\nSensitivity Analysis—There are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis. The red line shows the\ncorrespondence between scalar mass and scalar cost through\na parametric relationship embedded in the tool.\n3 merit change\nwhen each variable is changed. Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17. This kind of results can be useful to determine the\noptimal evolution of an architecture, such as in determining\nan optimal descoping option in the event of a downward\nbudget.\n15\nTable 6.

Local search around architecture #669, high-\nlighted on Table 5\n4 CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a methodology to assess the value\nof a system architecture using RBES Such methodology can\nbe used in the context of automatic architectural tradespace\nexploration to develop the part of computational tools that\nautomatically evaluates the architectures being generated. An\nexample of such tool was shown in the context of Earth Ob-\nserving Satellite Systems \(EOSS is\ndivided in two parts. First, the advantages and disadvantages\nof VASSAR with respect to the state-of-the-art of system\narchitecting tools is discussed. Second, the next steps in this\nresearch project are outlined.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of VASSAR\nThe following are advantages  the\nVASSAR methodology with respect to other frameworks:\n\(1  delivery\nloop. All requirements are directly traceable to stakeholder\nneeds. All capabilities are directly traceable to architectural\ndecisions.\n\(2  e.g., sci-\nence and engineering back-\ngrounds, simply because it is the way in which the human\nmind works.\n\(3  the domain-specific\nknowledge from the domain-independent knowledge, which\ntranslates into increased scalability and reusability, and facil-\nitates task allocation between system architects and software\nengineers.\n\(4  lessons learned: it serves as\na repository of knowledge to conserve expertise, and it also\nuses the lessons learned in the form of logical rules to evaluate\nsystem architectures.\n\(5  delivery loop facilitates more\n16\noptimal task allocation between man \(the system architect the computational tool architectures and through the use of the text-\nbased and graphics-based explanation facility. The system\narchitect feeds the tool with knowledge, guides the tradespace\nexploration process, and makes all non-objective decisions.\n\(6  of recursive algorithms, which\nare at the core of modeling emergence, which in turn is the\norigin of value.\n\(7  8  a computational price, which is only\nworth it if the knowledge base is likely to evolve.\n\(9  slow when the number of rules is very\nlarge.\n\(10  the expert knowledge \(e.g. lessons learned specific\npurpose: evaluating system architectures in the context of\nautomatic architectural tradespace exploration. Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSAR’s\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
