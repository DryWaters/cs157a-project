Multi-Label Classification by ART-based Neural Networks and Hierarchy Extraction Fernando Benites, Florian Brucker, and Elena Sapozhnikova Abstract This paper presents a data mining system for multi-label classification and hierarchy extraction from the predictions provided by a multi-label classifier. Classes in multilabel classification tasks are often hierarchically organized and the hierarchy is assumed to be known. A much less investigated approach and a more challenging task, however, is to suppose that the underlying class taxonomy is unknown and that a data mining system can infer it automatically. In our setting the proposed system is trained with multi-label data and is subsequently able to produce multi-label predictions along with hierarchical relationships between classes. The hierarchy extraction algorithm is based on building association rules from label co-occurrences. Within the framework we examine the performance of two recently introduced multi-label extensions of Adaptive Resonance Theory \(ART networks: Multi-Label Fuzzy ARTMAP \(ML-FAM Label Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Associative Map \(ML-ARAM in comparison with two state-of-the-art classifiers Multi-Label k-Nearest Neighbors \(ML-kNN account the quality of hierarchy extraction. We also develop a novel distance measure for the quantitative evaluation of the derived class hierarchies and compare it with two other distance measures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments on several benchmark datasets have been performed I. INTRODUCTION Searching for information in an ample database of documents classified in multiple categories can be an exhaustive task. Automatic hierarchical classification of documents using techniques from data mining and machine learning fields is now becoming a key technology in managing great amounts of information available from the Internet and large databases. This classification task is considered as Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC instances are labeled by multiple classes rather than just one and the classes are hierarchically organized. In recent years hierarchical multi-label classifiers have been developed that mirror the structure of the class taxonomy [1][4] or methods incorporating the class hierarchy information into a classifier 


5], [6 HMC algorithms work with known class taxonomies which should usually be provided by domain experts. However, it is often difficult to obtain such a hierarchy, for Fernando Benites is with the Department of Computer and Information Science, University Konstanz, Box 712, 78457 Konstanz, Germany email:fernando.benites@uni-konstanz.de Florian Brucker is with the Department of Computer and Information Science, University Konstanz, Box 712, 78457 Konstanz,Germany email:florian.brucker@uni-konstanz.de Elena Sapozhnikova is with the Department of Computer and Information Science, University Konstanz, Box 712, 78457 Konstanz,Germany email:elena.sapozhnikova@uni-konstanz.de example, when the data are changing frequently. For this reason, we are interested in solving a more challenging Multi-label Classification \(MC is unknown and should be found automatically. To solve this task, techniques for data-driven Hierarchy Extraction \(HE are needed. The proposed data mining system consists of a multi-label ART-based neural classifier \(ML-FAM or MLARAM recently introduced in [7 produces class hierarchies taking into account relationships between the labels assigned by the classifier to multi-labeled objects The key difference of our approach in comparison to learning hierarchies from data directly is the use of a multi-label classifier, which serves as a data mining system and enables HE even when available multi-label data are sparse or many instances remain single-labeled. One of the advantages of this approach is that a relatively small training set can be used to learn the classifier or it can be trained online, subsequently producing a large number of multi-label predictions for HE. A potential application of the proposed system is, for example, information fusion when the same data exist, but are labeled differently either by independent experts or by alternative class taxonomies. In such cases, the system would be able to integrate available knowledge by creating a common class hierarchy We examined the impact of using different multi-label classifiers on our system. Two well-known state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers ML-kNN [8] and BoosTexter [9] were chosen for comparison with ML-FAM and ML-ARAM. We 


empirically evaluated the system with these four classifiers taking into account not only their classification performance but also the quality of hierarchies obtained from their predictions. The latter can be quantitatively assessed by using datasets with known class taxonomies and calculating special hierarchy proximity measures between extracted and real hierarchies. In addition to the existing Constrained Tree Edit Distance \(CTED  TO  we developed a new distance measure for hierarchies named Lowest Common Ancestor Path Distance \(LCAPD better suited to our needs The paper is organized as follows. After introducing a general description of HE in Section II, the multi-label classifiers are presented in III. Hierarchy proximity measures are discussed in IV. Experimental results evaluating the proposed system on multi-label datasets with known hierarchies are described and discussed in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper 978-1-4244-8126-2/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE II. HIERARCHY EXTRACTION FROM PREDICTED MULTI-LABELS A. Hierarchical Multi-label Classification HMC extends MC by imposing a hierarchy on multilabels: A hierarchy H on L is considered as a rooted labeled directed tree, i.e. an arrangement of L in the tree form. We require that H contains each label i ? L exactly once and that the root of the tree has label 0 6? L. Since there is a one-to-one mapping between hierarchy nodes and labels we usually do not distinguish between them. Thus H can be interpreted as a set of edges H ? \(L ? {0 i, j i parent of i in H and with AH\(i excluding i The connection between multi-labels and a hierarchy H is as follows: If a multi-label m contains a certain label i ? L we require that its parent and thus all its ancestors are also in m: AH\(i can say that m is consistent with H . A family M of multilabels is consistent with H if every m ? M is consistent with H . In turn, H is then also termed as being consistent with m and M , respectively. It is important to note that the prediction task is still the same as in traditional MC 


and that the hierarchy itself is not part of the training data Thus, while the original multi-labels in an HMC dataset are assumed to be consistent with the corresponding hierarchy this cannot, in general, be true for predicted multi-labels How well the predicted multi-labels adhere to the hierarchy depends heavily on the used classification algorithm B. Hierarchy Extraction HE is the process of extracting an adequate hierarchy from a given family of multi-labels M . This problem does not have a unique solution: For example, the trivial hierarchy 0, i It is also important to note that predicted multi-labels usually contain errors which make them inconsistent with the true hierarchy. A good HE algorithm therefore has to trade off consistency for level of detail: The more trivial edges the hierarchy contains \(i.e. edges linking a label to 0 higher its consistency usually is, but the less information is contained in it and vice versa 1  generator was used for building a hierarchy from multi-label predictions. The algorithm works as follows a vidual labels are estimated using a confidence matrix C = \(cij being an ancestor of i, cij , is defined as cij := nij/ni where nij is the number of multi-labels containing both i and j and ni the number of multi-labels containing at least we set cii := 0 for all labels i b of the confidences cij and cji is smaller, and that confidence is set to 0. In addition for a fixed label i we expect that the values in the i-th row Ci cij have a confidence cij that is close to 1, while nonancestors should have confidences close to 0. To detect and remove non-ancestors from Ci we therefore sort Ci descendingly and find the largest difference in consecutive sorted values. All confidences except the ones before that difference are set to 0. This procedure is applied to each label i c 


a confidence cij > 0 a rule i ? j is created. To each label i ? L a level li is assigned as follows: Assign level 1 to all labels not appearing as consequents in any of the obtained rules. Remove all rules j ? k where lj = 1. The next level is assigned to all labels not appearing as consequents in any remaining rule Remove all rules j ? k where j is in that level. Repeat this procedure until a level has been assigned to each label or no rules remain. The next level is then assigned to any labels to which no level has yet been assigned d sign each label i to a unique parent. The idea is that the parent p\(i value ci,p\(i while still being higher than the level of i. The set of candidates Qi therefore contains all labels j for which cij > 0, and whose level is higher than the level of i: Qi := {j ? L : cij > 0 ? lj > li If Qi = ?, then 0 6? L is chosen as the parent of i representing the virtual root of the hierarchy. Otherwise we select among the candidates those with the lowest level: Q?i := {j ? Qi : lj = mink?Qi lk}. The j ? Q?i for which cij is maximal is then chosen as the parent of i The main problem of the adaptive filtering method used in the Thresholding step of the basic algorithm is that it fails if a label i is a root label and therefore does not have any ancestors. In this case Ci does only contain noise, and only part of that noise is removed using the adaptive filtering Therefore, additional filtering of the confidence matrix C is needed. We propose two following approaches: Global Thresholding and Voting 2 appropriate global threshold value hc for the confidence matrix. It analyzes the curve formed by the values cij > 0 when sorted in ascending order, looking for jumps, or, if there is no jump high enough, by checking if there is a point where this curve has slower growth, finding stable regions in the process. It is similar to the Thresholding step of the basic algorithm but uses the whole matrix and handles noise better First apply the Confidence Matrix and Thresholding steps 


of the basic algorithm. Then 1 the sequence x = {xn}, n = 1, . . . , N and calculate the greatest jump for the sequence K argmaxn\(?xn 2 P n xn 2?N ??xK < 0.1, we select a tolerance of 10% of the whole range, set hc = xK and continue to 3 the jump is high enough. Otherwise x is smoothed by a low pass filter with a rectangular window of size s = 2 ? log\(|L x x with the lowest index plus one, satisfying: ?f\(xc n f\(xn N  3 hc to 0 we filter the matrix globally. The Level Assignment and Hierarchy Construction steps of the basic algorithm are then performed to construct the final hierarchy 3 threshold c ? [0, 1] is performed after the Thresholding step by setting all confidences cij < c to 0. Afterwards, the algorithm continues as specified above. Since the optimal threshold value depends on the set of multi-labels, we extract hierarchies as described for different thresholds \(in our case for 200 values equally distributed in the range of [0, 1 construct the final hierarchy we attach the parent that was chosen most frequently to each label III. MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFIERS A. FAM and ARAM Due to space constraints only the basic steps of the algorithms are presented below, for more details see [13], [14]. A Fuzzy ARTMAP \(FAM organizing Fuzzy ART modules, ARTa and ARTb \(Figure 1 adapting existing or creating new prototype nodes in their second layers F2. The F2 fields are linked by the Map 


Field  an associative memory, which contains associations between ARTa and ARTb prototypes. This enables FAM to learn mappings between input and target pairs during training. In classification tasks, the target vectors usually represent class labels, for example in the binary form Initially, the ART modules have only one uncommitted prototype node, where the weight vector is set to unity and the Map Field weights are also set to unity. In the complement coded form [14], vectors A and B represent an input pattern and its class label vector. After presentation of A to the F1 field of ARTa, the activation function Tk given by \(1 the winner is then chosen by the Winner-Take-All \(WTA rule \(2 Tk\(A A ?W ak W ak 1 where ? denotes the fuzzy AND, element-wise min operator and ? > 0 is called the choice parameter TK = max  Tk : k = 1, . . . , N 2 The choice of K must be confirmed by checking the match criterion A ?W aK A a \(3 Map Field Fig. 1.

The fast-learning mode corresponds to setting ?a,b = 1. With fast learning, the Map Field weights are set to U b?W abK once the node K becomes committed and this association is permanent Although fuzzy ARAM may be tuned to be functionally equivalent to FAM, the architecture differs significantly \(Figure 2 are linked directly to the F1 fields of both ARTa and ARTb modules.

The Match Tracking process is started if needed When each match criterion is satisfied in the respective module, resonance occurs and the learning process follows During learning the selected node K learns to encode the input and target vectors by adjusting its weight vectors W aK and W bK similarly to \(5 B. Multi-label Extensions It has been shown in [7] that standard algorithms do not perform well on the muti-label datasets due to the use of the WTA rule \(2 been proposed: A set of Nb best categories with the largest activation values is chosen according to the rule: a category k is included in the set, if the relative difference \(TK?Tk is below a predefined fraction t of the activation range r = TK ? Tmin, where Tmin is the minimum activation of committed neurons. Activations of the Nb categories are subsequently normalized, uk = TkPN b s=1 Ts The resulting distributed output pattern P is calculated as follows P Nb s=1 usps. \(7 where for FAM ps = W br with r such that W ab sr = 1 which means that between neurons s of ARTa and r of ARTb an association in the Map field exists, and ps = W bs for ARAM. Thus, P contains a score for each label that is proportional to the number of neurons among the Nb best categories predicting this label. Since the fast learning of ART networks leads to varying performance with the input presentation order, voting across several networks trained with different orderings of a training set improves classi 


fication performance. The sum over the output of Equation 7 pattern P , which is used to determine the predicted classes Finally, a postprocessing filter method [12] is applied: the signals P are sorted descendingly, then all corresponding output classes are included in the multi-label up to the point of maximum decrease in the signal size from one class to the next A small modification is made in the ARTb weights, which now count label occurrences during learning by increasing their values by 1 each time the corresponding multi-label is presented. This modification leads to changes in the ARTb activation calculation of ML-FAM which is Tk = |B?W bk Another difference between the multi-label and the standard algorithms is that the former ones do not use Match Tracking with raising vigilance: The winner is simply inhibited C. Comparison of Classifiers To compare the two ART-based networks with other MLclassifiers, we chosen ML-kNN described in [8] and BoosTexter [9] which is an implementation of Boosting for the field of text categorization, based on the well-known AdaBoost algorithm [15]. ML-kNN and BoosTexter were chosen since these popular MC algorithms are nearest-neighbor- and rulebased, respectively, and therefore allow a comparison of the results of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM with algorithms based on other approaches than neural networks IV. PROXIMITY MEASURES FOR HIERARCHIES Approaches for quantitative comparison of graphs and trees are either defined on an abstract level, taking into account only the pure graph structure, or make use of the field specific semantics encoded in the graph. From the former category, we utilized the Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED  whereas Taxonomic Overlap \(TO  field of concept representation, which also deals with hierarchical structures encoded in graphs and trees. Additionally the Lowest Common Ancestor Path Distance \(LCAPD new tree distance measure, developed especially for the type of hierarchies common in HMC. A description of the mutual differences between these measures and the motivation for the development of a new metric are given at the end of this section 


A. Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED [10] is based upon the idea of transforming one hierarchy into another via certain local editing operations The distance between two hierarchies is the minimum total number of operations needed for transforming the one into the other. Three modification operations are considered: A node i is deleted by transmitting its children to its parent and removing i from the hierarchy. Inserting is the complement of deleting: Inserting i as a child of j makes i the parent of some subset of the children of j. Changing a node means changing its label. In order to make computation in polynomial time possible, the constraint that disjoint subtrees have to be mapped to disjoint subtrees is included in the definition [10], [16 The original definition does not include any normalization For two hierarchies with q labels each, 2q is the highest possible CTED  corresponding to deleting all labels of the first hierarchy and inserting all labels of the second hierarchy We normalize the CTED by 12q which results in distances in 0, 1 B. Taxonomic Overlap TO [11] compares the nodes of two hierarchies according to how many ancestors and descendants they share. We describe a version adapted to our experiments. Define semantic cotopy as SC\(i,H i j Given two hierarchies H1 and H2, the corresponding overlap for i ? L is defined as O\(i,H1, H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 Note that this is a symmetric expression in H1 and H2 with values in [0, 1]. The TO of H1 and H2 is the average of all overlaps TO\(H1, H2 1 q  i?L O\(i,H1, H2 For two identical hierarchies, TO is 1, while it is 0 if H1 and H2 are totally unrelated. Since the two other hierarchy 


proximity measures used in the experiments are distances with smaller values indicating higher similarity TO? := 1? TO to simplify comparisons C. LCA-Path Tree Distance Since in a hierarchy a parent is a more general concept than any of its children, the locations of the same label i in two hierarchies H1 and H2 can be compared by how far one has to travel up the chain of ancestors in both hierarchies until a common ancestor is found. For a label i ? L the depth dH\(i 0 dH\(i pH\(i a1, . . . , av the ancestors of i in H1, such that a1 = pH1\(i a2 = pH1\(a1 i common ancestor of i in H1 and H2, lca\(i,H1, H2 first ancestor of i in H1 which is also an ancestor of i in H2 j? := min  j | j ? {1, . . . , v} such that aj ? AH2\(i  lca\(i,H1, H2 Since 0 is an ancestor of all labels in all hierarchies, the LCA always exists. Note that usually lca\(i,H1, H2 lca\(i,H2, H1 We use the LCA to measure how far apart the positions of a label in both hierarchies are: If a label i has the same parent in both hierarchies it is regarded as being in the same position, otherwise the distances of i to its LCA in both hierarchies are used to measure how far apart both locations are. The cost for i is defined as d\(i,H1, H2 2 k=1 dHk\(i lca\(i,H1, H2 D\(i,H1, H2  0, if pH1\(i i d\(i,H1, H2 8 This can be seen as the length of the path from i to lca\(i,H1, H2 i,H1, H2 As D is not symmetric, the complete LCA-path distance

Comparison All three hierarchy proximity measures presented above reflect different concepts of tree similarity. It is thus not surprising that CTED and TO*, although they perform well in the domains they were designed for, may produce counterintuitive results when used in the field of HE. This is demonstrated by the hierarchies shown in Figure 3: Despite the fact that the relationships between the nodes in both hierarchies are completely different, their CTED and TO are 0.33 and 0.44, respectively. Their LCAPD, on the other hand, is 1.00. Thus only LCAPD marks both hierarchies with the highest possible distance Some hierarchies used in our experiments contain nodes with exactly one child \(single-child labels that TO* does not distinguish between such labels and their children, in the following sense: Given a hierarchy H and a single-child node i, we denote with H ? the hierarchy 


that is obtained from H by swapping i and its child. Then TO?\(H,H CTED or LCAPD V. EXPERIMENTS We tested the proposed data mining system with four multi-label classifiers: ML-FAM, ML-ARAM, ML-kNN and BoosTexter on three real-world datasets with increasing complexity from the text-mining field. In our experiments we compared extracted hierarchies to the original hierarchy by means of three hierarchy proximity measures: LCAPD CTED, and TO The experimental setup of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM had the following parameter values: choice parameter 0.0001; learning rates ?a,b = 1.0 for fast learning; vigilance parameters ?a = 0.9 and ?b = 1.0. The parameter t was chosen to be 0.05 for the 20 newsgroups dataset and 0.02 for the other datasets. The number of voters V was set to 9 Following [8], we used 10 nearest neighbors \(k = 10 Laplace smoothing \(s = 1 BoosTexter was trained using 500 boosting rounds as in 8] and the threshold for converting rankings into multi-labels was set to 0 [9 A. Multi-label Classification Performance Measures We used a large set of performance measures for evaluation of the MC experiments: First, two example-based measures for multi-label predictions: Accuracy \(A measure \(F  of the predicted labels are actually present while F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall calculated on the per-instance basis. The larger the A and F values, the better the MC performance Then two label-based measures were calculated on the basis of binary counts for each label: the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives We used the micro-averaged version of F1 with the binary measures counted on the whole test set. The perfect performance corresponds to F1 = 1. Additionally, micro-averaged precision and recall were used for computing the Area Under a Precision-Recall Curve \(AUPRC  precision corresponds to the proportion of predicted labels in the test set that are correct and recall to the proportion of labels that are correctly predicted. AUPRC has been claimed 


to be a well-suited performance measure for MC tasks where the number of negative instances significantly exceeds the number of positive instances [6]. Another advantage of AUPRC is its global nature and independence of a certain threshold value. The closer the AUPRC value is to 1, the better the performance Since these measures are based on the comparison of multi-labels, they depend on a transformation from rankings to classes. As a contrast we also used four wellknown ranking-based performance measures: One-Error OE RL C cision \(AP  for all ranking-based performance measures except AP. OneError evaluates how many times the top-ranked label is not in the set of proper labels of the instance. Ranking Loss is defined as the average fraction of pairs of labels that are ordered incorrectly. Coverage evaluates how far we need, on average, to go down the list of labels in order to cover all the proper labels of the instance. Average Precision evaluates the average fraction of labels ranked above a particular label i ? mt which actually are in mt And finally, the special hierarchical loss function H-loss 2] were utilized. Following [3], normalized costs were calculated: ci := 1/|c\(p\(i i ? L i of all direct children of i. Hierarchical loss \(H-loss consider mistakes made in subtrees of incorrectly predicted labels and penalizes only the first mistake along the path from the root to a node. The smaller the H-loss value, the better the performance B. 20 Newsgroups Dataset We modified the popular single-label dataset 20 Newsgroups [18], [19] by considering eight additional labels corresponding to the intermediate levels of the hierarchy faith, recreation, recreation/sport, recreation/vehicles, politics, computer, computer/hardware, science. This dataset is a collection of almost 20,000 postings from 20 newsgroups sorted by date into training \(60 40 data were preprocessed by discarding all words appearing only in the test documents and all words found in the stop word list [20]. Afterwards, all but the 2%-most-frequent words were eliminated to reduce the dimensionality. Documents were represented using the well-known TF-IDF \(Term 


Frequency  Inverse Document Frequency scheme [19]. The TF-IDF weights were then normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Conversion to TF-IDF and normalization were performed separately for training and test data. This resulted in the 1,070-dimensional dataset with 11,256 training instances, 7,493 test ones and 28 labels To test the performance of two HE algorithms, we first extracted hierarchies from the True Test Multi-Labels \(TTML and calculated the corresponding proximity measures. Both algorithms successfully extracted the original hierarchy We studied the performance of the multi-label classifiers and their ability to infer the class hierarchies in the presence of only partly available hierarchical information. We performed a series of HE experiments with multi-labels having a decreasing number of inserted non-leaf labels describing the levels in the hierarchy. We randomly removed such labels from 20%, 30%, and 40% of the training instances leaving them single-labeled. The results for predicted test multilabels are shown in Table I where the bold face marks the best classifier, and the first column \(left result of HE by Voting and the second \(right Thresholding \(referred as GT Comparing classification performance, one can see that the ART-based networks are superior to both the other classifiers in terms of most performance measures and that ML-FAM slightly outperforms ML-ARAM. Taken together they win on at least 6 and at most 8 out of 9 evaluation measures. BoosTexter has the second best performance, but its predictive power degrades more quickly with the increase in the number of single-label instances. The poorest MC results were shown by ML-kNN, its performance decreased very fast with any reduction in the number of multi-labels For example, F1 decreased by 15% while removing 40% of labels instead of 30%. It is also interesting to note that when trained on the dataset with 40% removed labels, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM significantly outperformed ML-kNN trained on the original dataset with all labels The hierarchy proximity measures confirm the good quality of predictions produced by the ART-based networks: The hierarchies were correct extracted by both HE algorithms of Section II-B even with 40% removed labels. The predictions of ML-kNN were the worst: The Voting variant of the HE 


algorithm could not extract the correct hierarchy with 30 assigning five labels incorrectly to the root label. None of the HE algorithms could extract the correct hierarchy in the absence of 40% multi-labels. With 40% and Voting, the number of labels falsely assigned to the root was 13, while with GT it was only three. For BoosTexter, Voting assigned two labels wrongly to the root label in the experiment with TABLE I 20 NEWSGROUPS ALL, -20%, -30% AND -40% RESULTS Measure all 20% 30% 40%ARAM FAM kNN BoosT.

Assigning more labels to the root creates more shallow and wider hierarchies \(trivial case as stated before The good hierarchy extraction with ART networks demonstrates the system robustness  even with strongly damaged data the system can rebuild the original hierarchy C. RCV1-v2 Dataset The next experiment was based on the tokenized version of 


the RCV1-v2 dataset introduced in [21]. Only the topics label set consisting of 103 labels arranged in a hierarchy of depth four is examined here. Documents of the original training set of 23,149 were converted to TF-IDF weights and normalized Afterwards the set was splitted in 15,000 randomly selected documents as training and the remaining as test samples In this case, the Voting variant of HE applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values 0.12, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively. The corresponding values of the GT variant are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.05. The poor performance of the Voting method is due to the fact that for the TTML only very high threshold values succeed in removing enough noise The Voting results are thus dominated by bad hierarchies extracted for all but the highest thresholds The classification and HE results for this dataset are shown in Table II. ML-ARAM has better performance results on this data set in all points than ML-FAM except for RL being the best of all classifiers in terms of the multi-label performance measures. BoosTexter is the best in terms of all ranking measures For both HE algorithms the distances of BoosTexter are the best, those of ML-FAM second, followed ML-ARAM and ML-kNN. All three distance measures correlate. Interesting is also that for ML-kNN the distance values obtained by both HE methods are almost the same The hierarchy extracted by GT from the TTML has much lower distances values as compared with the hierarchies extracted by both methods from predicted multi-labels. This reflects a specific problem of HE, since only a small fraction of the incorrectly classified multi-labels can prevent building of a proper hierarchy. For example, 16.5% of misassigned labels in the extracted hierarchy are responsible for about 80% of LCAPD calculated from the predictions of MLARAM. This large part of the HE error is caused by only 4% of the test data. Under these circumstances the other distances behave analogically. Most labels were not assigned making them trivial edges, but six labels were assigned to a false branch. This can happen when labels have a strong correlation and in the step Hierarchy Construction of the basic algorithm the parent is not unique in the confidence matrix. BoosTexters results suffer less from this problem because it generally sets more labels for each test sample 


Both HE algorithms behaved similarly on the predictions of the ART networks. They constructed a deeper hierarchy than the original one and wrongly assigned the same 11 labels to the root node. The higher distances come from Voting assigning more labels to the wrong branch. For MLkNN both algorithms again create very similar hierarchy trees, both misassigned 28 labels to the root label. For BoosTexter it was seven with Voting and eight with GT Voting produced a deeper hierarchy here D. WIPO-alpha Dataset The WIPO-alpha dataset1 comprises patent documents collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO ments. Preprocessing was performed as follows: From each document, the title, abstract and claims texts were extracted stop words were removed using the list from [20] and words were stemmed using the Snowball stemmer [22]. All but the 1%-most-frequent stems were removed, the remaining stems were converted to TF-IDF weights and these were normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Again, TF-IDF conversion and normalization were done independently for the training and the test set. The original hierarchy consists, from top to bottom, of 8 sections, 120 classes, 630 subclasses and about 69,000 groups. In our experiment, only records from the sections A \(5802 training and 5169 test samples H \(5703 training and 5926 test samples 1http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ITsupport/Categorization dataset/wipo-alpha-readme.html August 2009 TABLE II RCV1-V2 RESULTS Measure ARAM FAM kNN BoosT A 0.748 0.731 0.651 0.695 F1 0.795 0.777 0.735 0.769 F 0.805 0.787 0.719 0.771 OE 0.077 0.089 0.104 0.063 RL 0.087 0.086 0.026 0.015 C 11.598 11.692 8.563 5.977 AP 0.868 0.860 0.839 0.873 AUPRC 0.830 0.794 0.807 0.838 H-loss 0.068 0.077 0.097 0.081 Wins 4 0 0 5 LCAPD 0.29 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.34 0.34 0.21 0.18

Both main and secondary codes were used in the experiment, although codes pointing to groups outside of sections A and H were ignored. We also removed groups that did not contain at least 30 training and 30 test records \(and any documents that only belonged to such small groups 7,364 test records with 924 attributes each and a label set of size 131 In this case, the Voting variant of the HE algorithm applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values of 0.13, 0.12 and 0, respectively. GT showed the same values. Remarkable are the TO* distances, which are equal to 0. This is due to the fact that the WIPO-alpha hierarchy contains 16 single-child labels that are not partitioned by the true multi-labels: whenever a single-child label j is contained in a multi-label, so is its child, and vice versa. It is therefore theoretically impossible to deduce from the multilabels which of them is the parent of the other. As a result the HE algorithms often choose the wrong parent, resulting in higher LCAPD and CTED values. TO*, as described above is invariant under such choices The results obtained on the WIPO-alpha dataset are shown in Table III. The classification performance of the ART-based networks on this dataset is slightly worse than that of BoosTexter. Mostly in the terms of OE, RL, C, AP, AUPRC, and H-loss measures BoosTexter is better because its rankings are better and it assigned more labels to each sample. But the ART networks have better HE results because their predicted labels are more consistent with the original hierarchy. MLkNN has the worst classification results and distance values again. The reason for the high relative difference between LCAPD as well as CTED and TO* obtained for the ART networks or BoosTexter as compared to the results of the other datasets is because most of the labels were assigned in the right branch but not exactly where they belong Both HE algorithms extracted the same hierarchy from the predictions of ML-ARAM and a very similar hierarchy for ML-FAM. About 5% labels were assigned wrongly to the 


root label in the hierarchies of the ART networks.

Here, GT extracted a much worse hierarchy as shown by CTED being 0.15 higher for GT than for Voting For BoosTexter both HE methods built the same hierarchy and no label was wrongly assigned to the root. All extracted hierarchies were one level deeper than the original one Although Voting produced worse hierarchies than GT on two previous datasets, this time its distance values were comparable or even better. In comparison to Voting, GT has higher values for all distances on the multi-labels of MLkNN. Voting has the advantage of being a much simpler method and of being more dataset independent. Still the tree distances have the same ranking order for all classifiers for both HE methods VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC tive was to derive hierarchical relationships between output classes from predicted multi-labels automatically. We have developed a data-mining-system based on two recently proposed multi-label extensions of the FAM and ARAM neural networks: ML-FAM and ML-ARAM as well as on a Hierarchy Extraction \(HE algorithm builds association rules from label co-occurrences 


and has two modifications. The presented approach is general enough to be used with any other multi-label classifier or HE algorithm. We have also developed a new tree distance measure for quantitative comparison of hierarchies In extensive experiments made on three text-mining realworld datasets, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM were compared against two state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers: ML-kNN and BoosTexter. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is suitable for extracting middle and large-scale class hierarchies from predicted multi-labels.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
