allows deploying services at run time on network nodes. This architecture is accessible by medical and research personnel through a cloud interface. The target usage of this network is dual. First, it concerns both the access and the exchange of çbig dataé files, typically generated as result of human genome sequencing. Second, it allows to select the best data center in which processing all these data in a cloud fashion, so as to minimize the amount of exchanged traffic and/or the service time, that is defined as the amount of time elapsing from the initial request of processing ma de by the researcher/doctor up to the time in which processing results are available 
The rationale of using genome files as case study is based on the increasing scientific and societal need to utilize human genome data and the parallel development in sequencing technology that has made hu man genome sequencing on large scale affordabl cadem ia, business public health will take advantag e, in the next few years, of the massive information stored in the DNA sequence of the genome of any living body.

use of genomic information are specific and evolving over the time In synthesis, the proposed activity will faci litate the experimentation of novel sol utions addressing the storage requirements of big data in clouds and their processing The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we provide the background about computing tools for processing genomes content delivery networks, and cloud services. In section III we describe the main challenges we faced in the design of the ARES solution, which is presented in some details in section IV. Finally, we draw our co nclusion in section V II B ACKGROUND  Distributed computing has attracted researchers since decades. A reference computing architecture for scientific purposes is the so-called Beowulf cl uster. A Beowulf cluster can execute many different programs, in areas ranging from data mining in support of physics and chemistry research, to business areas such as the movi e industry. Nevertheless, a massive use of it has shown scalability problems in multi-user environments, essentially due to lock phenomena caused by competition in using files located in a shared Network Attached Storage \(NAS\Area Network \(SAN Notably, the cluster of the Na tional Center for Biotechnology Information \(NCBI\under gone scalability issues due to the increase of the genome sequence database and parallel explosion of the incomi ng que 4   of the  m o st widely used tools in computational biology A crucial aspect related to the BLAST execution is how databases are distributed. Parallel BLAST typically exploits data locatio n by grouping incoming queries and scheduling them to nodes that use the most recently requested  As sequencing techniques and the relevant ontology-based data bases evolve, the incoming queries exhibit dynamic patterns It is also worth to menti on Apache 20 whic h  is an open source implementation the well known MapReduce algorithm. Apache Hadoop is a software library designed for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers. It is designed to scal e up from single servers to thousands of nodes, each equipped with computing and storage resources. This library itself is d esigned also to manage application failures, thus supporting resiliency techniques. In order to adopt Apache Hadoop to process genome files, it would be necessary to use already available applications based on the MapReduce fram the desired application, which however seems an overly demanding effort. To have an idea of the required effort, please the reader can find a \(non-exaustive\e processing software can be found in Table 1  Hadoop is a distribut ed platform, all entities have to be located in the same data center, otherwise the impact of the inter-data centers communications on the other network traffic becomes  valid for all dis tributed com puting platforms. An interesting virt ualized approach to deploy computing cluster on demand is presented in   A Content Distribu tion Network \(CDN is a distributed network of servers and file storage devices, typically referred to as caches, deployed to store content and applications in geographic proximity to users, in order to reduce the network resources used to satisfy a customer request and improve his perception of the network servi     address a wide range of needs, such as multimedia content distribution over the Internet, cache large files for fast delivery support of on-line business applications and so on. The network architecture proposed here could also be compliant with the Application Delivery Network paradigm  In recent years Google and Amazon have struggled to tackle the problem of big data handling by their specific cloud applications. For example, the Amazon S3 cloud computing service provides a web services interface to store and retrieve namely, any amount of data This service may be actually used to store and retrieve genome data. Nevertheless, no specific tools are available for optimizi ng the perceived network quality on the basis of the specific research needs, e.g. optimized download time and number of accomplished requests through dynamic virtual machines VMs provisioning A first attempt in this direct ion is described in the work  which howe ver c ons iders the online processing of scientific data \(astronomic data in the specific example\with characteristics different fr om genomics data III P ROGRESS B EYOND THE S TATE OD THE A RT  The ARES solution consists of the design and deployment of an advanced CDN concept, able to both suitably store information and to find su itable location for instantiating applications used for processing bi g data. This solution is customized on genomic processing, even if it can be applied to a number of other scenarios Users of our solution will access the ARES cloud interface deployed over CDN services. Wh ile a cloud approach could allow a flexible use of the infrastructure, it requires careful strategic planning of cache deployment and management in order to address potential issues, such as security and bottlenecks. CDNs can bring signi ficant contribution to address these issues, enabling a cloud network to meet challenging large content delivery demands for satisfying customers   sim ultaneous use of both approaches, can actually provide the expected benefits of both techniques The ultimate goal of our proposal is to outperform the commercially available cloud servi ces, by using a similar level of technical complexity, for handling çbig dataé. The motivations underling our desi gn choices are the following Our application makes use of advanced signaling techniques able to discover the available network and computing resources throu gh any configurable discovery algorithm We can customize our CDN for any specific need of the application

Beyond çdata mobilityé, we make extensive use of application mobility We can rely on geographical proximity of processing nodes, and are well aware of the node location Thus, our approach consists of leveraging on the CDN ability to deliver large files and in troducing a suitable dynamic caching that allows the CDN to cache the content in geographically diverse areas \(see also our previous work [8    This dynamicity will be exploited for handling both genomic data caches and for suitably locating computing nodes processing genomic data, in a mutual attraction fashion. The result will be an improved end-user experience To achieve these results, we faced the following challenges Tools used for sequencing genes are computationally intensive. The time needed to fulfill queries is a function of the algorithm approach, the number and type of input sequences and parameter settings. For this reason is extremely complex to find an optimal schedule of queries, which should also take the coordination of database accesses into account. In addition annotation data have different data structures or ganized in heterogeneous metadata files He nce, it is challenging to make such data easily and efficiently accessible by requesting applications It is necessary to implement a decentralized management system, since the researchers producing, i ngesting and retrieving scientific data work in a decentralized manner it is difficult to generalize stab le metadata structures The system should therefore be open to sharing data and deploy services on many nod es. The genomic data processing will be done through different alternative software packages For example, we expect to make use of open source tools such as Cufflink, Tophat, Fastqc, Trimmo matic, Bowtie2, Cnvnator Blast, Bwa and gatk Parallel sequencing methods often optimize the response time to a set of queries by distri buting workload over a given number of software instances or pr ocessors. Nevertheless this approach may result substantially sub-optimal si nce it ignores the query arrival pattern and do not consider to dynamically provisioning the network according to it. The outcome of our research is expected to find the suitable workload distribution am ong different data centers co-located with GÈant points of presence \(PoPs implementation of the VMs ru nning the instances of the genomics processing tools over the available hosting nodes in PoPs dynamic creation and autonomic distribution of CDN caches, without any manual provisioning from human operators The system final configur ation will result from the requirements of the medical person nel participating in the project, that will be translated in to CDN management policies in terms of workload dist ribution, VM deployment, and dynamic cache instantiation. The application of these policies will be made possible by computing virtualization technologies, which are being depl oyed in the GÈant PoPs and managed by means of the OpenStack cloud management framework IV A DVANCED C LOUD AND N ETWORK VIRTUALIZATION S ERVICES  In order to realize the service architecture whose main functions have been sketched in the previous sections, we resort to the  virtualization framework for router and servers. In order to describe the nature and the objectives of the envisaged experiments, it is necessary to recall the main entities of the implemented NetServ architecture in some details. Figure 1 shows the general architectural model of NetServ. It is currently based on the Linux operating system The NetServ controller coordinates NSIS signaling daemons, service containers, and the no de transport layer. It receives control commands from the NSIS signaling daemons which may trigger installation or removal of both application modules within service containers and filtering rules in the data plane by using the netfilter libr ary through the iptables tool Each deployed module has a lifetim e associated with it. It needs to be refreshed by a specific signaling exchange by its lifetime expiration, otherwise it is automatically removed. The NetServ controller is also in charge of setting up and tearing down service containers, authenticating users, fetching and isolating modules, and managing service policies Service containers are user-space processes. Each container includes a Java Virtual Machine \(JVM\OSGi framework for hosting service modules. Each container may handle different service modul es, which are OSGi-compliant Java archive files, referred to as bundles. The OSGi framework allows for hot-deployment of bundles. Hence, the NetServ controller may install modules in service containers, or remove them, at runtime, without requiring JVM reboot. Each container holds a number of preinstalled modules, which implement essential services. They include system modules library modules, and wrappers of native system functions. The current prototype uses Eclipse Equinox OSGi framework Service modules, represented by circl es in Figure 1, are OSGi bundles deployed in a servi ce container. Figure 1 shows two types of modules Server modules, circles located within the upper-right service container. They act as standard network servers communicating with the external through a TCP or UDP port. We will use these types of bundles in the framework of ARES Packet processing modules, circles located within the

They are represented in Figure 1 by two boxes labeled as çGISTé and çNetServ NSLPé. GIST \(General Internet Signaling Transport prot oc  implementation of the NTLP. GIST uses existing transport and security protocols to transfer signaling \(i.e. NSLP behalf of the served upper laye r signaling applications. It provides a set of easy-to-use basic capabilities, including node discovery and message transport and ro uting. Since its original definition, GIST allows transporting signaling message according to two routing paradigms. It provides end-to-end signaling, that allows sending signaling messages towards an explicit destination, and path-co upled signaling, that allows installing states in all the NSIS peers that lie on the path between two signaling peers  Figure 1 Ö NetServ node architecture In we have shown our im plementation of a third routing paradigm, named off-pat h signaling, that allows sending signaling message to arb itrary sets of peers, totally decoupled from any user data flow. To this aim, we defined topological off-path domains of GIST peers. An off-path domain is defined by the value of a metric, that could be the number of GIST/IP hops or the estim ated network latency, and by a topological shape. In we defined and implemented three different off-path topological shapes Bubble, which allows disse minating signaling around the sender, i.e. to all peers such that their distance from the center of the bubble, measured according to the selected metric, is lower that the radius of the bubble Balloon, which allows dissem inating signaling around the receiver Hose, which allows disseminating signaling messages to peers close to the network path connecting information source and destination. An example of Hose signaling is shown in Figure 2 Thanks to the extensibilit y of GIST, other off-path domains can be implemented as they become necessary for different signaling scenarios The current implementation of the NetServ signaling daemons is based on an extended version of NSIS-ka, an open source NSIS implementation by the Karlsruhe Institute of  m e ntioned a b ove NSIS wraps the application-specific signaling l ogic in a separate layer, the NSLP. The NetServ NSLP is the NetServ-specific implementation of NSLP. The NetServ NSLP is able to manage the hot-deployment of bundles on remote nodes NetServ NSLP offers 3 types of messages with the relevant answers SETUP message, which triggers the installation of a specific bundle on the remot e NetServ node. It could carry an URL, pointing to a repository from which the remote node can download the bundle, or it could even carry the bundle itself in the payload. Its header carries several information: the version of NetServ and of the Bundle, the NetServ user which requested the setup, the bundle time-to-live, and an arbitrary series of key,value> pairs which are bundle-dependant that are passed as initialization parameters to the bundle, once it is installed REMOVE message, which explicitly removes an installed bundle from the remote node, before time-tolive expiration PROBE message, which is used to check if a specified bundle is installed on the remote node. The remote node can answer either that the bundle is actually installed or that NetServ NSLP is active but that the bundle is not installed. The PROBE response can also transport in the payload some specific infor mation about the probed NetServ nodes, according to the \(eventual specified in the forward PROBE

 Figure 2 ÖNSIS Hose off-path signaling, implemented through the instantiation of multiple NSIS off-path bubbles m  NS IS nodes clos e to the IP path. Nodes 2, 3, and 4 belong to the Hose between 1 and 5. In principle, node 5 is not request to be an NSIS node Furthermore, it is possible to define a new NSLP for each NetServ bundle, allowing to define specific signaling logic for each functional element of our architecture. All these NSLP would be multiplexed on the common, enhanced GIST layer It is known that a CDN is a network of mirrors that store replicas of the information sto red within a central repository When a user request a piece of information, the requests is redirected towards the mirror being çclosesté to the requesting users. Clearly, any distance definition may be used We have implemented an application module, named ActiveCDN that implements CDN functionality on NetServenabled nodes, which is an improved version of the cache m  which proposes to deploy ActiveCDN bundles on all the NetServ no des on the path between the information repository and the node requesting the content, by using the NSIS on-path signali ng. Also in the ARES service architecture, an ActiveCDN modul e is instantiated by a NetServ node having the role having the full control of the placement of the ActiveCDN modules. The ActiveCDN module can be redeployed to different parts of the GÈant network as needed, also by other ActiveCDN modules This is in stark contrast to the largely preconfigure d topology of existing CDNs The ActiveCDN module is in charge of caching both the genomic data files and the VM image files. It implements the HTTP server function by using the NetServ native support for Jetty, a light-weighted HTTP server implemented in Java which allows creating restful interfaces and managing different servlets. When the memory space is exhausted, data will be firstly moved to storage units, and then removed according to the classical least recently used \(LRU\even if LRU strategy is currently im plemented in the prototype being developed in the lab of University of Perugia, the strategy to optimally handl e genomic contents deserves further investigation. In fact, there are two aspects to take into account The first is that subsequent requests could be strongly correlated, thus a more sophistic ated strategy than LRU could be designed, also taking into account the type of VM used for processing genomic data. In or der to have an idea of correlations among different di seases, which could trigger specific patterns of processing requests, the interested reader can take a look at the Diseasome projec aspects to take into account is that the files we are considering genomes, VM images, auxiliary genomic files\be as large as a few GBs, thus the choice of storing and maintaining them in all nodes of the path between the content repository and the requesting node could be not optimal. In particular deduplication strategies \(see e.g. [3 to be investigated in order to find the best performing solution The node acting as content provider can be a separate bundle, managing a content repos itory in one or more GÈant PoPs, or another ActiveCDN, acti ng as a proxy of a content repository which is outside th e scope of the GÈant network This second case is necessary to correctly handle the NSIS signaling, which is the real enabler of the overall proposed service architecture As for the database organization in content repositories, in order to efficiently store and re trieve large amount of genomic files, we resort to an NoSQL approac this approach is that the NoSQL database management systems is targeted to deal with a huge amount of data, when these data do not require a relational m odel. Essentially, what matters is the ability to store and retriev e great quantities of data, without relationships between the elements. We propose to use an ad hoc   t repositories, implemented in Java We also propose a key-value management for in-memory caching for ActiveCDN modules In the proposed scenario each PoP has a certain amount of storage space and computational capabilities hosted in one or more servers and managed through a virtualization solution This infrastructure is managed through OpenStack. OpenStack is a cloud management system that allows using both restful interface and APIs to control and manage the execution of virtual machines \(VMs retrieving informati on about the com putational and storage capabilities of both the cloud and the available VMs. It also allows triggering the boot of a selected VM with a specific hardware configuration. Thus, it is possible to wrap, inside a certain number of VMs, different existing software packages processing genome files. Each VM is characterized by a minimum hardware configuration for executing a specific processing service. Virtual machine image files are stored within the storage units of the PoP managed by OpenStack OpenStack allows also to inject, in the managed server pool new VMs by using restful APIs. Furthermore, OpenStack is not bounded to the use of a single hypervisor, but it can make use of different drivers to support different formats of virtual machines and hypervisors, such as VMWare, KVM, Xen, etc We assume that within the nodes in the data center managed by OpenStack, a specific node executes a VM that hosts a NetServ instance. As shown in Figure 3, NetServ hosts an OpenStack Manager bundle able to interact with OpenStack to retrieve the information on the available VMs and on the hardware capabilities, so as to o ffer this information to the decision system. In addition, another NetServ node will run an ActiveCDN bundle. Using also the functions of the ActiveCDN bundle, it is able to retrieve the desired VM image file by a remote location by us ing the relevant URL \(i.e. other GÈant PoPs\nd using the OpenStack APIs to inject into the

OpenStack storage component this image. The ActiveCDN bundle can either be executed on the same NetServ container hosting the OpenStack Manager service module, or on an instance of NetServ deployed w ithin a different VM  Figure 3 ÖArchitecture of a GEANT PoP Finally, at least one of the NetServ nodes will run the decision system, implemented in the Genome CDN Manager GCM\rv bundle, shown in Figure 4. This service module will offer an addressable service to the end users via a web-based interface, and will coordinate all the elements involved in the processing during their execution The GCM node will make an intensive use of the NSIS capabilities. In the proposed architecture, the GCM can use a Hose off-path signaling scheme which extends off-path  to the NSIS-enabled nodes adjacent to those along the IP path between the signaling initiator and the receiver. As sp GIST can use also e x ternal applications to retrieve informati on useful for the signaling transport. In the Hose scheme, GIST can use the traceroute utility to retrieve information on the IP nodes that lie on the path between the in itiator and the signaling recipient. The signaling initiator will send this information on a signaling Bubble having a certai n IP hop radius. The node that receives the signaling message is able to read the IP hop radius of the Bubble and the path information, represented as a list of IP addresses. Then, it will determi ne if it must either forward again the signaling message or send it to the signaling application. If it is not a receiver, then it will run again a traceroute towards each of the addresses contained in the path in order to find the node of the path at the minimum distance from itself. If this minimum dist ance is lower than a target metric value, it will instantiate another signaling Bubble. The use of this off-path signalin g in the proposed architecture allows managing the NetServ nodes in each PoP as on-path nodes connected each other in a virtual signaling path, as illustrated in Figure 2 \(see the sequence of blue nodes Caching and distribution systems could be even more efficient with the support of NSIS and NetServ directly in routers. There is an ongoing effort to port NetServ in Juniper routers, exploiting the Junos core, which is FreeBSD  Figure 4 Ö Overall network scenario Another solution not bound to pro prietary platforms is to use routers executed on gene ral purpose hard ware running linux. It is possible to enhance their performance, making it close to that achievable by a specialized hardware, through the Netmap tool which is a novel framework for fast packet I/O running on general purpose linux/unix opera ting systems In this case, it could be possible to execute NetServ directly on routers \(implemented in linux servers achieving both innetwork service execution and optimized routing performance In addition, software defined net working paradigm have been already successful tested with NetServ, as sh  Our available solution handl es mirrors, together with the processing tools, in a totally new perspective, which jointly optimizes good performance and scalability issues. In the following, we detail all the steps needed to accomplish a processing request The signaling flow starts with a user that requires a certain processing service on some genomic files. The genomic data could be stored either in a remote server or in the local data center of the user. The user interacts through a web interface with the GCM, specifying the data source \(local path or URL and the type of required processi ng. Once the query is sent by the user, the control passes to the GCM The GCM will use its own NSLP in order to retrieve the positions of the auxiliary data \(annotations or reference data such as human genome\VM that can wrap the requested service, by means of PROBE messages. The VM position on the storage units will be obtained by querying the OpenStack Manager NetServ bundle in the PoPs Then, the GCM triggers the NetServ node hosting the VM repository to initiate an NSIS session towards the NetServ node hosting auxiliary data repository, and vice versa. The NSIS session will transport a probe messag e according to the Hose off-path signaling scheme  e ssage will follow the "virtual" path \(Fi gure 2 on the computing and storage capabilities of the PoP servers hosting NetServ instances close to the path between the data

and the VM with the processing software. When the NetServ nodes have collected this inform ation, they forward it to the GCM. Then, it uses the followi ng information to find the suitable position of the data cent er where both data and VM image have to be moved: data size, VM image size, minimum computing requirement, available bandwidth and network latency between data and processing VM, and available computing and storage capabilitie s of both the cloud node hosting the VM and of the cloud node hosting the data. The selected location could be chosen on the basis of the parameter to minimize, such as the overall service time and/or the exchanged network traffic, on the basis also of the requirement set by the requesting person  Whe n the processing service has finished, the output data will be returned to the end-user for download and stored, for any future usage in the NetServ ActiveCDN bundle Now, let us focus on the download phase, which is the basic CDN service offered by the proposed platform. Figure 5 shows the main steps of that signaling. Each HTTP interface is managed by the ActiveCDN bu  this bundle is designed in order to offer generic data distribution exploiting the NetServ hot-deployment capabilities for caching the data in a dynamic and efficient way. Each time an HTTP GET message reaches the restful interface managed by a NetServ ActiveCDN bundle, it starts an NSIS signaling session for installing a NetServ cache in strategic points of the network. The server uses the NetServ NSLP to setup the caches on the download path Then, it sends the PROBE message to retrieve an ordered list of the ActiveCDN caches installed along the path and, finally, it sends another SETUP message to change the state of the caches on the path. The latter message specifies the download sequence indicating, for each cache, the address of the cache from which the content can be downloaded, thus forming a sequence from the client backward to the cache initiating the signaling session. Then, the server redirects the GET message to the cache nearest to the client The cache bundle searches for the content and, if it is not found, it asks the content to the cache specified in the signaling message. The procedure either goes on until one cache actually hosts the content, or the request is returned back to the first cache, that can certainly send the requested content. The caches on path will store this conten t, passing through them, and finally the last one will deliver it to the client. Future requests will be redirected by the same NSIS signaling session illustrated above, even if the content will be served directly by the nearest cache hosting the data. This procedure is illustrated in Figure 5.\(b idered network scenario, the requesting HTTP client is the ActiveCDN bundle running in the PoP selected for hosting the computation, whereas the HTTP server is the ActiveCDN bundle/content repository found during the NSIS sessions triggered by the GCM In the network scenario of this proposal, there may not be NetServ nodes on the IP path between an arbitrary pair of NetServ nodes. Hence the Hose signaling scheme illustrated above is required both to install and to manage the ActiveCDN caches adjacent to the path \(the virtual path depicted in Figure 2\, the NetServ SETUP and PROBE messages will be carried by the Hose off-path signaling Finally, we have to mention parallel downloading techniques \(see, e.g., the related work  In fact the ARES network architecture, being able to cache the same content in different parts of the network, could also exploit parallel downloading to efficien tly transfer large files towards a destination from surrounding caches. We will evaluate the applicability of those techniques during the project lifetime Our planned experiments aims to investigate \(i metric is suitable for the successful usage of genomes and annotation for diagnosis and re search purposes, for associating requesting users with an available mirrors \(such as total number of hops, estimated latency available bandwidth\ \(ii the best policy for dynamical ly instantiating and removing caches, with reference to the user perception, the signaling load, and the information refresh protocols, \(iii\th e achievable performance when only a subset of nodes, with a variable percentage, execute the NetServ modules analyzed    a  b Figure 5 Ö \(a\signaling, highlighted in ye llow in subfigures, and \(b

Experiments will be structured according to the following steps definition of the service req uirements for genome and annotation exchange deployment of a suitable architectural framework, able to provide suitable insi ghts in service operation and usage perception in biomedical research environments deployment of mechanisms and protocols for service description, discovery, distri bution, and composition performance evaluation, in te rms of QoE, scalability total resource utilization signaling load, performance improvement and coexistence with legacy solutions V C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper we have illustrated the networking solutions defined and implemented in the framework of the project ARES. This project aims to offer medical and research personnel a suitable tool for handling genome data set in a networked environment. This p roposal makes an extensive use of virtualization, a dynamic and scalable cache management mechanism based on a modified NSIS signaling, augmented through the intr oduction of off-path signaling distribution A CKOWLEDGEMENTS  This work is co-funded by EU under the project ARES 1  supported by G…ANT/GN3plus in the framework of the first G…ANT open call 2  R EFERENCES

  15   module Trade studies of performance with respect to required delta chief orbit and the cost of ground operations support form important considerations in the design of the cluster architectures, and will be studied. Global designs will also need to consider the biome spread of the Earth so that the clusters are in optimal configuration when they fly over the appropriate biomes Finally this work can be extended to calculate many geophysical parameters beyond snow albedo such as vegetation GPP and radiative forcing of clouds to demonstrate the impact of improved BRDF using clusters on critical science application s  7  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   The authors are grateful to the following people for very useful discussions on the topics presented in this paper Warren Wiscombe  Jacqueline LeMoigne Alexis Lyapustin and Ralph Kahn from NASA GSFC Marco Sabatini from Universit\340 degli Studi di Trento in Italy David Miller from MIT and Thomas Hilker from Oregon State University   R EFERENCES   1   autonomous and distributed scatter manoeuvres for  Acta Astronaut vol. 82, no. 1, pp 95 109, Jan. 2013 2    System F6 Program Value-Centric Design  Proceedings of the AIAA Space Conference Anaheim, California, 2010 3  S Nag    crowdsourcing spaceflight software and STEM  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2012 4  S Nag   J   G  Katz   a n d  A   Saen z Oter o    STEM ed  Acta Astronaut  vol 83 no 0 pp 145 174 Feb 2013  5   spacecraft reorientation for earth orbiting clusters  Acta Astronaut vol. 53 no. 11, pp. 863 877, Dec. 2003 6   satellite systems for Multi-angular Multi-spectral  Proceedings of the 64th International Astronautical Congress  Beijing China, 2013 7   of Nano-satellite Cluster Formations for Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function  AIAAUSU Conf.
