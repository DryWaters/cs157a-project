to minimise unplanned equipment downtime are therefore significant factors in service support required to guarantee availability throughout operational life A major component of this capability is the provision of diagnostic and prognostic tools through advanced health monitoring Condition monitoring employing novelty methods is therefore a key aspect of this process In novelty detection or one-class classification a model of normality is constructed from normal data with significant 
deviations from that model classified as abnormal 1 In the field of condition monitoring this technique is particularly well-suited to the identification of event precursors in data sets where the number of abnormal examples is too small to adopt a conventional faultdetection multi-class classification approach This is a typical scenario in high-integrity systems such as gasturbine engines in which faults are very rare in comparison with long 
periods of normal operation 2 Existing Work Current methods of novelty detection in aerospace gasturbine engine data suffer from a number of disadvantages 1 A novelty threshold is set on the model output such that data exceeding this threshold are deemed abnormal this is the decision boundary The setting of this novelty threshold often relies on a heuristic approach 1 Such heuristics are typically derived from engineering 1 


experience and have no principled quantifiable measure of the likelihood of false detections which is required for making business decisions regarding the operation of condition monitoring This reliance on heuristic expertise also makes transferral of knowledge between engineering projects difficult typically the setting of novelty thresholds is performed in a heuristic time-consuming manner for each new engine design This also precludes the use of the system in an automated on-line setting as the model's novelty thresholds cannot be set without human intervention 3 2 Many high-integrity systems are susceptible to the presence of noisy data which can result in undesirable false-positive novelty detections In the analysis of gasturbine engines for example the cost associated with a false-positive alarm is particularly high and must be reduced as much as possible while still being sufficiently sensitive to detect episodes of abnormality 2 3 Existing approaches require an explicit training period sometimes over 50 flights in duration for aircraft engines 4,5 during which the model cannot perform novelty detection It is desirable that novelty detection is performed as early as possible ideally from the entry of the system into service This paper presents the results of an investigation into a new method of novelty detection that overcomes these disadvantages Paper Overview In Section 2 we describe the vibration data domain used in the investigation described by this paper introducing challenges for the novelty detection process that arise due to the nature of aerospace gas-turbine vibration Section 3 describes a proposed Bayesian extension to extreme value statistics that allows the setting of novelty thresholds to be performed in a principled probabilistic manner and which allows novelty detection to take place during model training The application of the technique to several large data sets of vibration data recorded from a modem gasturbine is described in Section 4 and results of novelty detection are presented Finally Section 5 discusses the advantages and limitations of the proposed technique and introduces topics for further research 2 GAS-TURBINE VIBRATION DATA Modem aerospace gas-turbine engines divide the task of air compression from atmospheric pressure to that ultimately required within the combustion chamber into several stages Many gas-turbine engines within the civil aerospace market involve three consecutive compression stages the low pressure LP intermediate pressure IP and high pressure HP stages 6 Air passes through each stage as it travels from the front of the engine to the rear being further compressed by each until it reaches the combustion chamber Each of the compressor stages is driven by its own turbine assembly resulting in three corresponding turbine units situated within the exhaust stream at the rear of the engine Each compressor is linked to its corresponding turbine by a separate shaft which are mounted concentrically In threecompressor engines these are named the LP shaft the IP shaft and the HP shaft The operating point of the engine is often defined in terms of the rotational speed of these shafts 7 Transducers are mounted on various points of the engine assembly for the measurement of engine vibration Vibration data used for investigations described in this paper were acquired using the QUICK acquisition system 8 that computes spectral representation of engine vibration via high-resolution FFTs at rate 5 Hz for each sensor output Engine vibration is assumed to be pseudo-stationary over this measurement period such that the generated FFTs may be assumed to be close approximations of actual engine vibration power spectra Tracked Orders A tracked order is the fundamental data type used in the investigation described by this paper and is defined to be the amplitude of engine vibration measured within a narrow frequency band centred on the fundamental or a harmonic of the rotational frequency of a shaft 4 During normal engine operation most vibration energy is present within tracked orders centred on the fundamental frequency of each rotating shaft we term these the fundamental tracked orders Using the terms LP IP and HP to refer to engine shafts we define fundamental tracked orders associated with those shafts to be JLP lIP and JHP respectively Vibration Signatures We define a vibration signature to be the vibration amplitude or phase of a tracked order measured over a range of speeds of the corresponding shaft For example a signature may be constructed from IHP vibration data measured as a function of the speed co of the HP shaft Tracked order vibration is measured across the speed range   O 100 2600 maximum speed of the corresponding shaft This speed range is subdivided into B equal bins defining B sub-ranges of o Within each bin b  1 B vibration amplitude or phase values observed within the corresponding sub-range of shaft speeds are collected Figure 1 shows an example vibration signature in which amplitude of vibration lxl is shown against shaft speed o for B  400 bins on the horizontal axis Mean vibration amplitude u can be seen to be generally increasing with 2 


shaft speed while maximum variance of lxl occurs at approximately o  5000 In this paper we consider only vibration amplitude the use of phase is considered as future work in Section 5 1D,5  05 lo\(1 20 40 M sQ m 8 90 PI  shaft speed Figure 1 A vibration signature showing vibration amplitude lxl against shaft speed a Mean vibration amplitude u is shown as a yellow line plotted through the centre of each distribution Example novelty thresholds are shown as red lines above and below u Existing Use of Vibration Signatures Previous approaches construct a speed-based vibration signature from vibration values observed during a single engine run which could be either a single flight or a single ground-based test cycle 4,5,7,9 The vibration values in each of the B bins are averaged resulting in a vector of B average vibration amplitudes for each engine run A model of normality is then constructed from these B-dimensional vectors using clustering methods 10 or a Support Vector Machine 4 This has been shown to allow the separation of vibration signatures from normal and abnormal flights However these methods suffer from the three disadvantages noted in Section 1 reliance on heuristic expertise potential for over-sensitivity resulting in false alarms and the requirement for a training period during which novelty detection does not take place Furthermore by only using the mean vibration value in each speed bin useful information regarding the full distribution of vibration data is discarded For the purposes of the investigation described by this paper we wish to consider the full distribution of vibration values within each of the B speed bins For each bin b we will find lower and upper novelty thresholds hmin and hmax respectively such that if a flight contains vibration classified abnormal Example novelty thresholds are shown in Figure 1 as red lines 3 THEORY This section describes the proposed method of setting novelty thresholds in each speed bin b such that the previously-identified disadvantages are overcome First conventional approaches to setting novelty thresholds are described which are seen to result in oversensitivity to noisy in the normal data Secondly the field of extreme value theory EVT is presented as a statistical method for setting novelty thresholds that can overcome this sensitivity to noise but which has further disadvantages of its own when less than 50 engine runs of data are available Finally a novel Bayesian extension to extreme value statistics is presented that overcomes this requirement for large amounts of data by modelling uncertainty in our estimate of the data distribution This allows novelty thresholds to be set using as few as 2 engine runs of data and which adapt to new data as more engine runs are completed Conventional Methods for Setting Novelty Thresholds Given the distribution of vibration amplitudes within a speed bin b conventional methods of setting novelty thresholds could be used in which a statistical model is fit to the data giving an estimate of the underlying data distribution p\(x Approaches to this vary from parametric approaches in which the data are assumed to be generated from a known distribution such as the Gaussian distribution to semi-parametric approaches such as using a Gaussian Mixture Model 11 The novelty threshold is then set in the tail of this distribution p\(x often using the cumulative distribution such that P\(x  1-H where H is the probability of observing an abnormal event e.g H 10-6 An example is shown in Figure 2 in which a Gaussian distribution has been fitted to normal vibration data in a speed bin b and an upper novelty threshold hmax set in its tail here using the cumulative probability distribution P\(X  1_10-6 However because the novelty threshold is set far into the tail of the distribution it occurs where p\(x takes very small values and where the gradient of p\(x and P\(x is almost zero Thus small changes in the normal data can result in significant changes in the location of the novelty threshold making it oversensitive to noise amplitudes falling outside the range hmin hmax it will be 3

Experimental Methodology Given that each data set contains data from a separate engine an engine-specific approach was simulated by considering each data set separately To simulate the on-line novelty detection process we step through each data set flight-by-flight each flight resulting in a 20-bin signature for each of the three fundamental tracked orders Stepping through flights from 2 n at flight n we will compare data from the current flight against a model of normality constructed from the previous 1 n-i flights Thus at flight n for each of the B speed bins we form a data set from the N 3 maxima from the 1 n-I flight signatures observed so far treating each tracked order separately I.e at flight n we have a distribution of 3\(n-1 maxima for each of the B speed bins for each of the three tracked orders This is repeated separately for minima As described in Section 3 we can now set lower and upper novelty thresholds hmin and hmax in each speed bin We set thresholds using three methods for comparison Method 1 conventional ML-based EVT as described in Section3 Method 2 the proposed Bayesian-EVT method Method 3 a heuristic method currently used by domain experts This latter method sets novelty thresholds hmin and hmax for observed data X as follows hmax  lx  KImax\(X hmin u KL08x-min\(X 8 where ux is the mean of X and K is some constant chosen heuristically on a model-by-model basis to best separate normal data from abnormal data typically taking values intherangeK 1.2 1.5 Classification Thus for each of the three methods at flight n we have set novelty thresholds hmin and hmax in each of the B  20 speed bins for each of the three fundamental tracked orders A method classifies a flight tracked order signature abnormal if it contains vibration data that exceed novelty thresholds in two or more speed bins This latter restriction removes the potential for single-point noise spikes to cause a tracked order signature to be classified abnormal according to the agreement between the classification of a tracked order signature output by the novelty detection method normal or abnormal and presence or absence of an engine event or precursor event as described in Table 1 The sensitivity is the proportion of tracked order signatures containing actual engine events that were correctly classified as abnormal Sensitivity  TP TP FN The specificity is the proportion of tracked order signatures containing no actual engine events that were correctly classified as normal Specificity  TN TN  FP 10 These two metrics are often used for comparing the performance of classification schemes 1 with the ideal novelty detection method having sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 Results Results of setting novelty thresholds using the three methods are shown in Table 2 given as sensitivity and specificity Note that because data sets B1   B4 contain no abnormal events the sensitivity will always be zero because TP  0 These normal data sets are used only to evaluate the specificity of each method Discussion When applied to the abnormal data sets Al and A2 all three methods detected both of the engine events and the same set of precursor events Several of the precursor events from data set Al were not detected by any of the methods due to the low magnitude of vibration amplitude observed during those flights However all three methods provided the same amount of advance warning of the main engine event which took place in flight 71 detecting the first precursor event during flight 65 Thus the sensitivity can be seen in Table 1 to be identical for all three methods The specificity of the three methods is significantly different with the heuristic method attaining specificity 0.73 the ML-based EVT method attaining 0.83 and the proposed Bayesian-EVT method attaining 0.99 This significant improvement in specificity is the key advantage of the proposed method over the original MLEVT method and the heuristic method which were suspected a priori to suffer from large numbers of falseWe define true-positive TP false-positive FP truenegative TN and false-negative FN classifications 7 9
