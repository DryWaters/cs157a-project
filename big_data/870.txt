This system consists of naturally occurring sulfur-rich springs emerging from 
glacial ice, which are a known environment for microbial life. The biological activity of the spring is associated with sulfur compounds that can be detected remotely via spectral analysis. This system may offer an analog to far more exotic locales such as Europa where remote sensing of biogenic indicators is of considerable interest. Unfortunately spacecraft processing power and memory is severely limited which places strong constraints on the algorithms available Previous work has been performed in the generation and execution of an onboard SVM \(support vector machine classifier to autonomously identify the presence of sulfur compounds associated with the activity of microbial life However, those results were limited in the number of positive examples available to be labeled. In this paper we extend the sample size from 1 to 7 example scenes between 2006 and 2008, corresponding to a change from 18 to 235 
positive labels. Of key interest is our assessment of the classifier\222s behavior on non-sulfur-bearing imagery far from the training region.

Of particular interest are deserts, ice sheets, mountain ranges, and other nearly or totally inaccessible lo cales [1][2][3]. These studies and others yield invaluable data on natural and human 
induced climate change, seas onal variation, global-scale dynamics, and a host of other relevant inquiries. In the realm of missions to other planets, remote sensing enables the otherwise impossible goal of analyzing large inhospitable regions too distant for direct human observation and study. However, the same challenges remain no matter the application at home or among the stars: remote observation generates far more data than can ever be successfully downlinked. For non-terrestrial missions, the requirement of time from the Deep Space Network creates severe financial and political burdens that are often responsible for the decision to end a mission on an otherwise still functioning spacecraft Several approaches have been employed to address this limitation. Data compression was legendarily utilized to rescue the science return of the Galileo spacecraft \(high 
gain antenna deployment failure  and cont i nues t o be a mainstay of satellite communi cation. Cooperation between in-situ spacecraft to relay data over the horizon or to boost transmission bandwidth has now also become possibl  Yet even as we increase our data throughput capability we are also increasing the capacity for our sensors to generate truly enormous data sets. Spacecraft now carry hyperspectral cameras capable of sensing hundreds of wavelengths simultaneously in a streaming, real-time ma Despi t e al l t h i s dat a  product i on and transmission capability, the majority of data collected by any streaming camera is redundant or otherwise uninteresting after a region has been initially scanned Instead, key regions with unusual or dynamic features may 


  2 be selected as high priority while static areas, once surveyed, may receive lower pr iority. Time-based events may be predicted and captured in similar manner. But often events are either unpredictable or not known to exist prior to discovery. Thus an onboard detector capable of deciding when a region is interesting based on predefined criteria would yield a much higher science return. Many such detectors have been created for a variety of specialized applications such as fl vol cani c erupt i ons [8 and novel image detection aboard Martia In our case, we are supporting NASA\222s mission to discover living systems and their evidence by creating a remotely sensed detector for sulfur compounds Prior work on precisely this question has been hampered by a lack of available labeled hyperspectral im e  will be extending these results by including two orders of magnitude more data for both test and training sets 2  T ARGET   B ORUP F IORD   E LLESMERE I SLAND  Set in the far north of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago 81\260N, 81\260W\, Ellesmere Island abuts the northern edge of Greenland between the Lincoln Sea and Baffin Bay. Like other ice-covered terrain in our solar system, it does not appear at first glance to be particularly hospitable to life Yet from the air can be seen vivid yellow stains along a glacial edge. Discovered by Benoit Beauchamp in the mid 1990\222s who also collaborated on later field investigations with Stephen Grasby, Damhnait Gleeson, and Marie-Eve Caron in 2006, these discolorations were identified as Supraglacial deposits associat ed with sulfur-rich springs flowing through and across a 200-meter thick glacier  The telltale yellow stain was due to the presence of elemental sulfur, which dominates the composition of the deposits. The source of these minerals most likely relates to marine evaporite deposits of anhydrite \(CaSO 4 the region\222s bedrock. Unfortunately, the various deposition structures and spring locations greatly varied between field campaigns. As the Fiord is onl y accessible for three months of the year, the activation cycl es of the springs during the remaining year are not known nor are the conditions that spur their flows The springs themselves are interesting scientifically based only on the above, but more fascinating still is the presence of elemental sulfur, gypsum, and hydrogen sulfide gas These three compounds contain sulfur in three different oxidation states. The presence of a complex redox system in addition to such an abundance of elemental sulfur out of equilibrium with its environment, provided an indication that microbial mediation of the local geochemistry could be occurring. Testing the water from all ten known springs detected a rich microfauna of known and as yet unidentified mi Thi s arrangem e nt of fi ssured perm anent  i ce sulfur-bearing subsurface rock, and seeping water is potentially analogous to the surface of Jupiter\222s moon Europa. Frigid beyond any place on Earth, Europa still demonstrates surface sulfur-bearing mineral taint on otherwise solid ice along fract  The reddi sh-t i nged lenticulae \(round-shaped pot ential upwelling\long double-lined fissures speak of a subsurface ocean likely rich with dissolved minerals St udy i ng t h e m i crobes surviving beneath the Borup Fiord glacier might therefore also shed light on potential habitats beneath Europa\222s surface. As elemental sulfur o ccurs naturally generally from either volcanic or anaerobic bacterial processes, producing a remote elemental sulfur det ector is a step towards a microbial life detector both for the cryosphere of Earth and potentially for Europa as well 3  I NSTRUMENT   H YPERION ON EO-1 The Hyperion imager aboard the near-polar-orbiting EarthObserving-1 spacecraft \(EO-1\kilometers altitude resolves the Earth\222s surface to 30 meter resolution simultaneously in 220 distinct spectral bands ranging from 0.38 to 2.5 m \(near ultraviolet to short-wave infrared\ [6  The first hyperspectral sensor to operate from space, it captures 7.5 kilometers by ~100 kilometers of land area with each image. Designed to assist mining, geology forestry, agriculture, and environmental management through the classification of su rface type and features, it has successfully generated over 27 Tb of raw data available as various products from the USGS Although EO-1 has 220 bands of hyperspectral data available via the post-processed, downloaded products onboard operation only has access to 12 bands at a time Thus, any autonomous algorithm must select the 12 most relevant bands to the inquiry at hand. Selecting which of the 220 bands to examine is of paramount interest. One consideration is the existence of decreased signal to noise ratios at increased wavelength \(band number  W e  expect therefore that our selection process will likely favor shorter wavelength bands 4  D ATA P ROPERTIES  We used seven flyover images of Borup Fiord as our test and training dataset \(Table 1\Individual pixels were labeled by Damhnait Gleeson using the commercial ENVI toolkit, aerial photos, and the PixelLearn image labeling software developed by the Machine Learning Group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Each i m age i s  256 pi xel s  wide and of variable length \(mean 3200 pixels\th 220 frequency bands available for each pixel. See Table 1 for the number and type of labels used in each image. We utilize the L1R Hyperion processed to reflectance \(as opposed to radiance\to help mitigate such effects as sun angle. Further, we have taken seven similarly sized flyovers of regions far from the sulfurbearing glacial springs that we label "Sulfur-Free" as a

Graphical versions of these provided labels are provided in Figure 1 Original results on this study were provided based entirely on training/testing utilizing th e single 2006 image \(Figure 1 top   We can show without any processing that distinction between sulfur and non-sulfur \(ice and rock challenging simply by selecting two arbitrary wavelength bands and plotting the labeled data to investigate the degree of separation as shown in Figure 2. The sulfur pixels are well mixed with the ice pixels with some overlap with the rock pixels as well. Further, two subpopulations are evident in the pixels labeled as sulfur; we distinguish these as 223Bright Sulfur\224 and \223Dark Sulfur\224 and will discuss this distinction further in Section 6. Note that the \223Dark Sulfur\224 points are especially easy to c onfuse with rock and similarly dark ice  Figure 2 All labeled data \(pixels\ter plot with two arbitrary wavelengt hs as the axis.

These classifiers attempt to construct a hyperplane \(in our case, within a 12 dimensional space of reflectances\two classes of previously labeled data. A linear kernel SVM is defined by n+1 parameters: a weight \(w i ple x i bias term \(b These weights and bias are determined during the training step by solving a quadratic programming problem with one degree of freedom: the regularization parameter C which determines how strongly to penalize training errors. Classification of a new example x is achieved by  1 212 212  003 2   xx i i exxK  which generally provides highe r accuracy, due to increased representation power, and is an example of what we might be able to achieve given mo re spacecraft resources than generally available on EO-1 Feature Selection To accommodate the restrictions imposed in onboard computation, we must select 12 wavelength bands from the potential 220 available for Hyperion data. This is a classic feature selection problem, and we will compare the following methods of band selection  1 ection [18 Startin g with th e empty set, train a classifier based on a currently accepted set of bands and test performance as baseline. Then exhaustively add each band one at a time evaluating freshly trained classifiers for each new set. Select the one with the highest performance. Continue until 12 are selected. This procedure is known to be weak against the case of pairs or larger sets of data that must be admitted together to add information to the classifier 2\ Recursive Feature Elimination \(RFE\8 Startin g with  the entire 220 available bands, train a classifier on this accepted set and calculate perfo rmance. Then exhaustively remove each remaining band one at a time evaluating freshly trained classifiers for each new set. Select the one with the highest remaining performance. Continue until only 12 bands remain. This procedure incorporates groups 003 the Gaussian width  212\002  n i ii bxxwsignxF  where the linear dot product can be replaced by a kernel function K\(x i x\plicitly maps each point into a new possibility infinite dimensi onal linear separability is achievable.

C trades off penalties for errors on the training data against model complexity; small values permit better generalization while large values more accurately fit the training data. The \223best\224 result will be some set of bands one of the four sets selected above\C value, and number of permitted classes. This configuration can then be coded and uploaded into EO-1 for autonomous sulfur detection Labeled Data Filtration In our search for a highly accura te classifier, we allowed the possibility that our labeled examples were less than pure Labeling these pixels manually is a challenging task even for experts. Marginal, borderlin e, or even incorrect labels may be present especially give n the coarse spatial resolution of the labels \(see Figure 1\Umaa Rebbapragada has constructed a label confidence evaluation method based on averaging across multiple EM clustering\222s of the labeled data named Pair-Wise Expectation Maximization \(PWEM  21  In i t s general form ul at i on, PW EM suggest s t h at  improved results may be obtained by permitting a reweighting of input labels based on these results; however in our case we perform the much more coarse procedure of filtration of any labeled example less than 75% consistent with others of its same class The final part of this study reports on the use of a Gaussian kernel, an advance over the linear kernel. A second hyperparameter 003 must be swept across for generalization testing in addition to the standard SVM C. We do not anticipate being able to upload an algorithm to EO-1 based on a Gaussian, but it is interesting to examine just how much better such a classifier may perform. Future missions are likely to have increased capability and to be able to make use of Gaussian SVMs 6  R ESULTS  Band Selection  The bands of interest generated by the three feature selection methods are shown in Figure 3 and Table 3. The standard deviation was calculated across all labeled examples for a given wavelength \(2585 measurements for each of the 200 bands overall standard deviation pattern indicates the sensitivity of the Hyperion instrument  and i s l a rgel y i n fl uenced by at m o spheri c absorpt i on properties  Spectrum reflectance values should theoretically vary only between 0 \(no reflectance and 1 \(total reflectance However, as the wavelength increases so does the noise eventually yielding obviously erroneous inclusions well outside this range. Unfortunately, the greedy forward selection method preferred some higher wavelengths that proved detrimental to its generalization later in the process Due to computational limitations on runtime, the forward method performance was not pursued beyond this point  Table 3.

Elemental sulf has a rat h er unusual  reflectance spectrum, ranging from 7% below 430 nm to 90% above 500 nm. Other than this transition between low and high, there is no structure to its spectra. Thus, we expect detecting its signature to be very challenging. Figure 3 superimposes this reflectance over the selected bands with 100% reflectance normalized to the graph maximum

Everything left of the red line was filtered as being too uncertain 


  7 Expanding from 3 to 4 Classes  An early attempt at this analysis showed abundant false positives \(FP\sing the entirely of the sulfur training set and a 3-class SVM \(~10 5 FP events per downlinked image We suspected that there were multiple populations including potentially false labels\thin our sulfur training set. We applied a K-means clustering met t o t h e sulfur labels that immediately yielded two distinct populations: one with high mean reflectance and one low We divided our sulfur labels according to the clustering results, yielding four classes, and discovered that most of the false positives were from the \223dark\224 sulfur class Therefore, although this division was not obtained via manual labels, it still provided a very useful refinement of the labeled data and, as we will show, led to improved performance. Physically, sulfur th at occurs within rock rich pixels is extremely difficult to distinguish from sulfur-free rock-rich pixels. Table 4 shows the breakdown per image of bright and dark sulfur labeled examples  Table 4 Test / Train Data Source Detail from Borup Fiord Scene ID Bright Sulfur Labels Dark Sulfur Labels EO1H0570012006187110PY 17 1 EO1H0570012007182110KF 26 74 EO1H0570012007192110KF 22 13 EO1H0570012007205110KF 22 3 EO1H0570012007217110KF 22 0 EO1H0570012007224110KF 19 0 EO1H0570012007227110PF 16 0  Filtering Poorly Labeled Examples  Armed with our three band sets of interest \(RFE 2006, RFE and Expert Pick\nvestigate the mislabeling comparison previously discussed. PWEM i d ent i f i e s for each labeled example the proba bility that it was correctly labeled. Figures 4 & 5 show the distribution of these percentages for both the 3-class and 4-class labelings. Ice labels proved to be the most reliable, which is not surprising since selecting pure ice examples in the image is quite easy Rock was similarly well labeled with a few remote outliers However, sulfur was highly contentious. Examining the Yaxis of Figure 4 \(3-class labeling\ a single sulfur label exceeds 0.75 probability of being correct. Separating into bright and dark \(X-axis\mmediately rise to 104 144 bright sulfur labels as above 0.75 confident, and 39 / 91 dark sulfur labels above 0.75 confident. At this point, we discarded any label not above 0.75 confident as too uncertain for use. We will report these results as \2234class filtered.\224 This necessary step al so has the unfortunate effect of removing 40% of our already very limited positive examples. However, again, we will see that this leads to an improvement in performance. The low-confidence pixels tended to occur near ice-rock boundary areas. The 0.75 filter limit was determined simply by empirical observation that the \223clear\224 cases of ice a nd rock are rarely below this value while both sulfur classes span the entire range of probability. Any more stringent requirement would have seriously jeopardized our already limited positive example labeled data  SVM Performance Metrics  Let us now define our metrics. The X-axis of all comparison graphs is the F-measure \(F as calculated by the harmonic mean of recall \(R\sion \(P         005\006 005\006 005\006 2   where L B are pixels labeled Bright Sulfur, L D are labeled Dark Sulfur, L I are labeled Ice, and L R are labeled Rock Similar nomenclature is used for D to refer to detected SVM classified Correct is the total number of correct detections of bright sulfur \(or dark sulfur as bright sulfur, to give the benefit of the doubt Missed is the total number of failed detections of labeled bright sulfur identified as anything but bright sulfur False is the total number of incorrect bright sulfur identifications \(ice or rock identified as bright sulfur\e also compute two other statistics, both addressing false positives identified outside the original labeled pixels. If sulfur is detected in any unlabeled pixels within th e source images, these are considered \223likely false positives\224 and referred to as Likely FPOS on the graphs. The name derives from the fact that we cannot be certain there are not other sulfur sources elsewhere in this image, but they certainly should be small in number compared to the entire image. The second statistic of this type we call \223Sulfur-Free FPOS\224 as it represents the number of pixels in the seven new scenes taken very far from the known sulfur source \(images of clouds, opposite hemisphere ice sheets, frozen ocean, etc Any positives found in the Sulf ur-Free images are simply mistakes   For each configuration, we trai n on six of the seven labeled  RP PR F SS S R SS S P DDLS LLDS DDLS Missed Correct Correct False Correct Correct RIB Missed RIB False DB B Correct 


  8 images and use the seventh as test, then rotate through each of the images as test for cr oss-validation. The precision recall, F-measure, \223Likely FPOS\224 and \223Sulfur-Free FPOS\224 are then computed from the appended list of all tested pixels, i.e. precision, recall, and F-measure are calculated at the end of the cross validation not for each cross-validated image  For all linear kernels, we evaluate the SVM hyperparameter C 007 10 2 205  10 3 by factors of ten. These ranges spanned the empirically observed dynamic region between numeric instability and the SVM\222s total failure to generalize.

Note that the histograms have been normalized to 1 for comparison despite each class being substantially different in number of labeled examples   SVM Performance  Figure 6 shows the performance of the SVMs for various class numbers and kernel type, and mislabeled filtration strategies. On the right we s ee the Sulfur-Free FPOS results along the Y axis, while on the left we find the Likely FPOS results. Note that there are always more Likely FPOS than there are Sulfur-Free FPOS. This makes sense, as the Likely FPOS is a harder problem \(s eparate sulfur from nearby sulfur-like terrain\han separating entirely non-sulfurous terrain from sulfur-bearing surroundings.

For the Gaussi an kernel example, we use these same C\222s but also vary the Gaussian width parameter 003  003 We have separated the sets of 12 bands \(Expert, original RFE result using only 2006 image, and current RFE result\ into blue, red, and white points respectively. The optimal results would be points lying at the bottom-right of each graph with zero Likely Sulfur-Free FPOS \(Y\easure of one \(X note the y-axis is a log scale in number of false positives  The linear kernel 2-class \(sulfur / non-sulfur\ shows poor performance. While several configurations achieve an impressive F-measure of up to 0.80 - 0.82 for all three band selections, there are more than 10 4 Sulfur-Free FPOS Similarly poor generalization occurs in the Likely FPOS of the unlabeled examples fro m the source image. Thus though the labeled data was fit, it failed to generalize to more remote examples  The linear kernel 3-class \(ice rock, and sulfur\ shows immediate improvement in all three band selections with remarkable improvement in the Expert picked bands and the new RFE results. Sulfur-Free FPOS were reduced by two orders of magnitude to a mean of ~40 FPOS per Sulfur-Free image. Likely FPOS remained high, however, with a mean of ~3400 per image. The mean and maximum F-measure also increased with a new top achievement of 0.86  The linear kernel 4-class \(ice rock, \223bright\224 sulfur-on-ice and \223dark\224 sulfur-on-rock\ demonstrated two immediate consequences relative to the 3-class performance. The first was that the Sulfur-Free FPOS actually increases to a mean of ~70 pixels per image. Likely FPOS was dramatically reduced yielding a mean of ~800 false positives per image. Most of the later improvement was due to the decision to define all sulfur on rock \223dark sulfur\224 labels as unreliable and no longer count them towards our accuracy requirement. The mean F-measure increased further with a mean of ~0.9 and a maximum of 0.96. As we increased our performance by filtering out a portion of our positive labeled instances, a more rigorous method to remove contaminat ed training examples became attractive  Employing PWEM\222s confidence estimation method on the 4-class data and rejecting anything less than 0.75 confident the mean F-measure of 0.90 was maintained while reducing the mean Likely FPOS to ~600 per image. Sulfur-Free FPOS reduced further to a mean of 24 pixels per image. We take these results to indicat e that mislabeled training examples were indeed corrupting our results and generating false positives. While further filtration of example labels might in principle yield further improvements, we have already discarded 40% of our very limited positive examples for the gains shown here and further filtration is unlikely to improve performance. For EO-1 Hyperion effort, we would select one of the blue or white indicators on the graph representing a particular combination of band Expert Pick or RFE\ hyper-parameter \(3-20 is roughly comparable in performance\s linear kernel SVM would then be uploaded for operation. Unfortunately we still expect ~500 false detections on images near Borup Fiord

However, certain parameter pairings do show significant promise  False Positives in the Training Images \223Likely FPOS\224  Our inability to extinguish unw anted false positives on the training images is troubling. A best result image using the Gaussian kernel results with C = 0.25, Gaussian width 1000, and RFE band selection showing the location of these false detections is provided in Figure 7. The accuracy for this case was an F-measure of 0.83, 0 sulfur-free FPOS, and 50 Likely FPOS per image. The top of the figure shows the original image \(visible wavelengths only\The middle panel shows the location of the original labeled data where cyan is ice, yellow is rock, viol et is sulfur on ice, and green is sulfur on rock. The last panel shows white for all labeled locations after filtration based on PWEM\222s confidence estimation and red for \223bright sulfur\224 false detections that were reported as Likely FPOS. We immediately observe a correlation between small icy valleys, glacier edges, and false detections. Thus, the filter has indeed learned to recognize terrain similar to where sulfur occurs but still has trouble detecting the \(very faint\ yellow tint to the sulfurbearing region  This points out a weakness in this multiclass SVM application, namely that if a user provides examples of clean, unambiguous areas \(such as our ice and rock labels but then specifies a minority class within ambiguous background detail \(such as sulfur only existing in ice-rock mixture pixels\a y accurately \(according to the training data\n to predict that mixes of ice and rock are good determinants of sulfur presence. Thus, we have constructed both a sulfur-detector and a rock-ice mixture detector at the same time 7  C ONCLUSIONS  Overcoming the practical challenges of autonomous detection oftentimes exceeds in difficulty the mathematical treatment or data interpretation itself. In our case, we faced erroneously labeled examples, a bimodal population within our labeled sulfur examples, a single geographic sulfur region for training, a limitation of only 12 out of 220 bands to examine, and restricti on to a linear kernel. Even extending to the Gaussian ke rnel, we found our ability to remove false detections in highly similar \(nearby\ to that which housed the sulfur example was lacking, resulting in at best ~50 false detections throughout a single mean 


  11 image measuring ~ 256 x 3200 corresponding to 0.006 false alarm rate. This is significantly superior to the figure cited by Castano of 0.2% based only on 2006 data. While these may seem like small numbers, we are attempting to detect small events isolated in frequency and region size Thus false positives are very co stly should such a detector be utilized to schedule additional satellite observation runs or downlink data  However, in the development and evaluation of this classifier we did determine that while three classes of terrain was a good fit to the data \(ice, rock, and sulfur\o eliminate the majority of false positives especially on data far from the source images we were fo rced to carefully prune our input labels using filtration base on the PWEM estimation method. We also recognized that of the bimodal sulfur population, the \223dark sulfur\224 class \(sulfur occurring on rock\e majority of the false positive source. By discarding the dark class as unreliable, we obtained significant improvement in our false positive rate overall but especially in distant imag ery where less than one event in a mean 256 x 3200 image is expected. All of this was done while preserving a representative F-measure of ~ 0.9 with regard to the filtered labels  Of feature selection methods, we demonstrated that Recursive Feature Elimination RFE\ains an excellent tool to pare down uninformative, corrupted, or noisy satellite wavelengths when constructing such a detector empirically better than a greedy forward method. We also showed that the addition of substantially more data than past work yielded a much more successful classifier \(using bands selected by RFE vs. RFE 2006 only positive labeled examples remains the most significant source of error. In particular, labeled sulfur sources that do not all geographically collocate would greatly enhance our generality and help to reduce false positives  The use of a Gaussian kernel did demonstrate a higher FMeasure than was possible w ith the linear kernel with strong reduction of the FPOS. This indicates that when it becomes possible to operate a Gaussian kernel aboard a spacecraft such as EO-1, it shoul d be pursued. However, the CPU time cost for such algorithms must always be weighed against their improvement in performance. We are currently investigating an implementa tion for the EO-1 spacecraft  A variety of options for further work on this front exist in the absence of new positive labels. One possibility would be to provide yet another class for \223rock/ice mixture\224 separate from the sulfur positive examples to assist the classifier in avoiding nearby false positives. This would require further example labels from the domain expert that may or may not always be available. We treated our problem as though this was not an option  A second line of attack would include nonlinearity in into the model by computing functions of the input channels differences, averages, ratios etc. of various wavelength bands\This may enhance the contrast of the sulfur signature or eliminate confounding input such as ice/rock mixture information  Third, we may examine the SVM raw output directly for each classification. If the output for the \223best fit\224 class is itself still negative, we might conclude that there is no sufficiently explanatory cla ss and disregard the SVM\222s classification. This could potentially reduce false positives dramatically 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models. The following is a summary for the potential benefits of introducing DHF models to reliability and PHM  i

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
