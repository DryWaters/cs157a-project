Nanjing, China wangwei5@njnu.edu.cn        Abstract To confirm that visual training can change EEG patterns by association rule mining method, firstly, we collected the EEG of people who are under a long-term visual professional training \(visual training group\ and novice people \(control group\ during a specific mental tasks. Secondly, we determined the difference of brain electrical activity between the two groups using machine learning methods. Thirdly, we discovered distinct 
patterns using association rule algorithm, finding that the two groups were separable based on their completion of visual professional cognitive tasks. In the beta band, visual training group showed a specific and significant association pattern which included FP1 and C4. The results indicate that the EEG patterns were modified because of visual professional training. We further discuss the impact of long-term visual professional training on the EEG Keywords-visual training; professional training; brain development; association rule mining; EEG I  
 I NTRODUCTION  Cognitive Neuroscience shows that learning and training have an important effect on brain development as manifested through brain plasticity. Studying the impact of professional training on brain function is not only important for understanding physiological changes, but also provides a scientific basis for targeted mental development and personnel training. Many researchers have been studying professional training and its impact on brain development using different techniques, such as the EEG, fMRI, PET etc. These studies 
have found that there is a change of signal rhythm in the corresponding brain areas due to different brain functions led by long-term professional development skills training 1 Our previous study on the high classification results of different majors in EEG has shown that people have a unique pattern of EEG in particular mental tasks after a long period of professional training, that is the direct reflection of the different patterns of human brain development under professional training 5 On the basis of this study, a further study is justified 
to identify the internal differences in brain signals of different cortical areas, between professional training groups and an appropriate control Visual-spatial ability is one of the basic functions of the human brain. Through specific training, it can be highly devleloped, and the corresponding cortical structures can be affected. Results of fMRI and PET studies show that visualspatial ability corresponds to the frontal region of the temporal lobe 6 Compared with controls, people who have fine arts training typically exhibit significant changes in the frontal area 
EEG studies have shown that brain electrical activity in visualspatial functional areas have changes associated with training reflecting an increase in low frequency oscillations in the frontal region, and an alpha band decrease 7-8 But the observed is somewhat limited, since a comparison was only made in static regions and brain activity patterns during cognitive task performance, and only a single region or parameter was compared. It is likely that multi-regional and multi-parameter studies will yield the best results. However with an increase in the scale and quantity of data being 
analysed, the mining of brain activity pattern of cognitive function will be a requirement In this paper, we examine the EEG changes produced by the brain when it participants perform visual cognitive tasks following visual professional training. We compared the performance of an experimental group who received visual professional training, to a control group, and analysed the differences in their EEG, using machine learning methods including association rule mining

II  E XPERIMENT D ESIGN  A  Subjects selection We selected four college students with Art & Design majors as the experimental group, who are typically good professional painters, and eight college students from other major as a control group. Two majors were selected to ensure that the professional characteristics of the control group did not impact on the experimental results. Subjects were right-handed good healthy and without history of mental illness. Their average age was 23, and they were half male and half female All agreed to participate in the experiment voluntarily B  Visual professional cognitive task design There were six sisual professional cognitive tasks including 1\magining designing a house, including the spatial structure of the house, including shape, color and the position of furniture; and \(2\magining or designing a statue, including the shape, color, etc C  Data collection method We use the VEEG 3.0 software to analyze signals, while setting the low-pass filter as 30Hz and high-pass filter as 0.5Hz. The sampling frequrency was 512Hz. The experiment used a 19-lead electrode cap to collect EEG signals according to the international standard 10-20 system \(as shown in Figure 1\. All electrodes were referenced to linked earlobes. During the experiment, subjects were required to keep their eyes fixated to reduce eye-movements, and to minimise any external interference on signal acquisition  Figure 1  International standard 10-20 system for 19lead placement D  Experiment All the six tasks require subjects close their eyes. We used a simple block design method: firstly, subjects were required to completely relax with eyes closed for 2 minutes, and then under guidance \(with eyes closed\to imagine different scenarios. The duration of each task was 1 minute. There was 1 minute for subjects to relax between tasks III  D ATA A NALYSIS  A  Feature Extraction of EEG The alpha wave is a common indicator of electrical activity in the cerebral cortex during the awake and resting state, and is most prominent in the occipital and parietal occipital lobes When a person opens their eyes, the alpha wave changes significantly. The beta wave reflects activity while the cerebral cortex is in a state of focused attention or heightened emotion and is more obvious in the frontal and parietal lobes. When somoeone opens their eyes or processes some information, the beta wave will appear. In this study, the power characteristics of the three bands from 19 leads were extracted using the Fourier transform \(alpha1, alpha2, and beta\ The number of variables in the data set was 20, being the EEG power characteristics from 19 electrodes, and a class label, i.e., belong to the visual training group or the control group B  Data pattern classification algorithm To recognise discriminating patterns in the EEG, it may be possible to use many machine learning classification algorithms, such as backpropagation neural networks which are highly adaptive. Using backpropagation typically achieves good classification results for small samples. It uses the error back propagation training algorithm, and operates in two phases: the first phase \(the feed-forward process\ sees the information from the input layer fed through the hidden layer where the the output value of each unit is computed; the second phase \(the error-propagation process\ computes the output error, and the corresponding weights in the hidden layer are adjusted. We use 10-fold cross validation to provide generalisable results from testing, where the same data set is used for selecting cases for training C  Association rule discovery algorithm As an important branch of data mining, the aim of association rules discovery is mining interesting rules among the different attributes of a dataset. Class association rules CAR\re a special subset of association rules, since the right attribute is limited to a class. Using CARs, we aim to identify the hidden rules between attributes and classes 9 With the EEG data, we want to discover any interesting association patterns between the properties of all brain areas and professional classes. Two important parameters in CARs are support and confidence in the algorithm Suppose D is a data set, Y is the set of all classes set, and I is all of the property values, and d is one of the samples, with a set of attribute values and a class. A CAR is with "condset Y" form, which condset 004 I, and y 004 Y. The number of d is condsupCount. The number of d which the class attribute values for y is rulesupCount. Suppor =\(rulesupCotmt 9 D\*100 9 confidence =\(rulesupCount 9 condsupCount\100 9 The minsup is the minimum support threshold, minconf is the minimum confidence threshold. If suppor>= minsup and confidence>= minimum, then the rule matches our criterion for selection There is a potential problem with support in data mining. If the support threshold is set too high, we may miss some

important rules. If it is set too low, there will be a large number of meaningless rules. We compare the results of several experiments identify the best trade-off between low and high support thresholds In this study, we use the CBA software package  for EEG data mining IV  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS AND A NALYSIS  A  Experimental group and control group classification The data set included 240 samples: 80 samples were from the experimental group, 160 samples were from the control group. We extracted the power spectrum of 3 band values for the 19 leads for each sample data as the signal features, amd then used the backpropagation neural network to classify them In the visual professional recognition task, the classification results of each band value of the 19 leads EEG data are shown in Table 1 TABLE I  Classification result by BP neural network Band Classification Accuracy Rate alpha1 71.55 alpha2 80.75 beta 89.12 The results of classification accuracy rate show that in visual cognitive tasks, the performance of the visual training group and the control group is different. The alpha1 and alpha2 bands were quite weak, but the beta band was approximately 90%. This indicates that the impact of visual professional training was greatest on the beta wave. Overall through visual training, we can see quite distinct patterns of separable brain electrical activity B  EEG activity pattern discovery of the experimental group In the cognitive tasks, we use association rule mining method to mining EEG rules of different bands. When minsup=20%, minimum=80%, the two group have EEG patterns with their own characteristics. Removing invalid rules the effective rules are shown in Table 2. The results are further described below TABLE II  minsup=20%, minimum =80% rules of discovery Band Association Rule Power Range of Leads 002 Unit 002 W 002  alpha1 FP2  F3  C4}==> 0 464.79<FP2<=472.237 626.889<F3 487.368<C4<=699.647 FP1  FP2  C3}==> 0 626.002<FP1<=630.141 464.79<FP2<=472.237 800.604<C3 F3  F4  C3}==> 0 615.888<F3<=626.889 F4<=461.742 731.011<C3<=792.871 alpha2 FP2  F4  PZ }==> 0 FP2 <= 898.415 F4 <= 692.745 986.141 < PZ FP1  FP2  PZ 0 959.841 < FP1 <= 1002.359 FP2 <= 898.415 986.141 < PZ FP1  F3  F4 }==> 0 898.415 < FP2 <= 910.888 001  921.28 < F3 <= 1025.867 F4 <= 692.745 beta FP1  C4 }==>1 FP1<=2976.055 3422.273<C4<=4185.909 F4  C3 }==>0 F4<=2839.781 3013.991<C3<=4096.839 FP2  F4 }==>0 4220.961<FP2 F4<=2839.781 Note: "1" : the visual training group, "0" : the control group 1  The results from the data mining showed that the performance of the visual training and the control groups was significantly different through their distinct association patterns. In the beta band, the visual training group showed a significant and specific association pattern : {FP1 C4 }==>"1 that is when the FP1 <= 2976.055 & 3422.273 <C4 4185.909, the class of subject belonged to the visual training group, that is more than 88.88% reliable. This shows that visual training can indeed change EEG patterns of different brain areas. In the control group, there were also a lot of rules indicating that people without professional training may need to mobilize more regions to participate in brain activities 2  In the rule {FP1 C4 }==>" 1 ", FP1 is located in the left prefrontal cortex, C4 is located in the right central area According to the results of discrete data, the range of the power level of FP1 and C4 is shown in Table 3, the minimum initial value is determined by the sample data. The italic text mode is the range of characteristic associated with the visual training group. Beta wave activity of the rules is concentrated in the prefrontal cortex and the central area. This is because the frontal area is closely related to high-level thinking activities while the central area is located at the edge of the frontal lobe The power is determined four grades by the size: higher, high low, lower. So, using FP1 for the lower power and C4 for the higher power, we can represent the effect of visual training on EEG patterns  TABLE III  THE POWER RANGE OF BRAIN REGIONS IN RULES  FP1 C4 2823 001 2976.055 002  2903 001 3391.127 002  2976.055 001 3010.697 002 3391.127 001 3422.273 002  3010.697 001 4047.436 002  3422.273 001 4185..909 002  4047.436 001 4506 002 4185..909 001 4415 002   C ONCLUSION

By using association rule mining, we have found that the EEG patterns from the visual training group and control group are significantly different. This reflects that the long-term professional training will affect the visual development pattern in the human brain. Such differences are not only in different bands but also in different regions, and also in the multiregional and multi-parameter cooperation in the work pattern The physiological mechanisms of the different region, and the reasons that lie behind the observed differences, need to be further investigated.

as traits in our context  4. Method  We propose a new analytical framework to identify the relations between multiple SNPs and traits. The proposed method consists of two phases. In Phase 1 dimensions of SNP genotype data are reduced by means of the TF-IDF weighting method. Once reduced multiple SNP-trait associations are located from the data in the second phase through class association rule mining  4.1. Dataset  We used the HGDP panel data in the study, which are provided by the Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH The data contain a pool of SNP genotypes of 1,043 individuals selected from 57 population groups. SNPs of an individual amount to more than 660,000 in number. To eliminate the impact of the gender factor SNPs on sex chromosomes were eliminated1 The 57 population groups were broadly divided into Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East, America and Oceania  4.2. Phase 1: Dimensionality Reduction  The SNP genotype data are of high dimension in nature, which makes it particularly challenging to apply conventional analysis methods. In order to alleviate the problem, we first reduce the dimension of the data using TF-IDF weighting, after transforming the data according to the document-term model, as explained above. Under the model, each population group is deemed a document, and each SNP genotype as the term constituting the document. Then, the TFIDF weight of each SNP genotype is calculated as follows  b b   \b         \(6 


 where TFij is the normalized term frequency of SNP j in population i, and IDFj is the log-ratio of the total number of populations and the number of populations that have SNP j In accordance with the calculated TF-IDF weights top-k high-scoring SNPs are selected from each population. Only the SNPs appearing at least once in the top-k lists are used for class association rule mining in Phase 2  4.3. Phase 2: Rule Mining  In the second phase, we analyze the reduceddimension SNP genotype data through the transaction analysis model. If a SNP genotype retained by an individual is considered as an item, it is possible to deem each individual a single transaction. Within this context, SNP genotype data are transformed into a set of transactions. Further, each transaction is labeled with a trait, which is in our context, a population group Once transformed, the conventional class association rule mining becomes applicable. The class association rule is expressed, as follows  f 7  where representing a set of SNP genotypes and Populationj represents  1 http://www.cephb.fr/en/hgdp 320 the jth population. This rule implies that the SNPSet is likely to be associated with the jth population In conventional class association rule mining, the support is defined over all classes. In our context however, it may penalize the small-sized populations as they are likely to be ruled out because of the inevitable low frequency co-occurrence of the SNP sets and the population. In order to address this problem 


we introduce a normalized support that is a support normalized by the size of population. On the other hand, for confidence, the conventional definition can be used as is. The rule confidence and population support are given as follows    01"+23456278+,-./+.018      \(8 9 01"+234561278+,-3234561278     \(9  Rule confidence represents how strong the association between a SNP set and a population would be. In other words, a rule is given a high confidence when the SNP set appears frequently in the population group, and not in the other population groups. On the other hand, Population support refers to the frequency of a SNP set existing in a population group. By appropriately setting these two parameters, we are able to obtain rules that highlight population specific SNP associations  5. Results & Discussion  To attest to the validity of the proposed method, we conducted three tests. First, we conducted a clustering analysis using the reduced-dimension SNP genotype data in order to see the efficacy of the TF-IDF weighting as a dimensionality reduction tool. Second we carried out rule mining to discover rules associating SNP sets to populations. To prove the validity of the rules obtained from the experiment, we performed literature survey. Unfortunately, no studies have been conducted on the SNPs that we extracted in the rules let alone the relations between them and the population Finally, we iterated the same test, this time to discover rules associating SNP sets to the geographical regions instead of populations. The validity of some of the rules obtained in this experiment was proven through previous studies on the SNPs that are related to the Asian population [12 For the dimensionality reduction test, each of the 57 


population groups in the dataset was considered as a single document, and a SNP IDgenotype pair with minor allele was considered as a term. After weighting the terms using TF-IDF, we extracted top-100 terms from each population group. Using these terms, the Jaccard similarity between each population group was computed Figure 1 represents the dendrogram of the populations that was constructed using the Jaccard similarity as the similarity metric. The result shown in Figure 1 suggests that the TF-IDF-based weighting could be a viable alternative for the dimensionality reduction for the SNP genotype data. The reason is that population groups sharing the same branch are those who live close to each other or those who live in the same country. It is reasonable to assume that ethnic groups living in similar geographical regions and sharing similar cultures must come from the same origin It was difficult, however, to interpret the results concerning the Bantu group, since most of the populations in Bantu group had only one or two samples in the dataset. Still, it seems plausible to Figure 1.  A dendrogram constructed with top100 SNP genotype data using Jaccard similarity 321 analogically infer that the emerging pattern of SNPs minor allele of each individual using the Bantu language is similar to each other. One intriguing matter is that the Chinese minority group of Uygur population shares branches with other Muslim population groups In other words, Uygur population shows a high similarity with Muslim group. Indeed, they turned out the decedents of Osman Turks2  Rules Population [F-score rs98278[mm] Bantu_N.E.

Rules extracted from the second experiment where the associations between SNP genotypes and populations are identified. The M and m refer to major and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively  Previous studies on genetic structures of ethnic groups reached a similar conclusion. Rosenberg et al conducted clustering analysis using SNP data clustering 52 peoples into 6 clusters [11]. Each cluster belongs to one of the following: Africa Europe+Middle East+Central/South Asia, East Asia Oceania, America and Kalash population. Under this scheme, Europe, Middle East and Asia populations constitute one cluster. A similar result was observed also in our study. For example, in the left part of the 


dendrogram, Asian and European populations are shown to share the same branch. In the middle part American populations share a branch. And in the right  2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_people part, Africa populations share one branch and Central/South Asia populations share another Next, the class association rule mining was tested The resulting frequent SNP groups of subject populations further revealed the frequent SNP sets unique to some population groups. Some of the results are shown in Table 1. Table 1 depicts top scoring rules up to three returned less than three rules that exceed our quality constraints. We used 0.3 for both Rule Confidence and Population Support. In the end, 3,779 rules were drawn out. Under each rule, M indicates the major allele of the relevant SNP locus, while m refers to the minor allele of the locus. Most of the rules are 3-SNP rules with the 5-SNP rule being the longest. Each rules weight is computed through the following ;  9  9 A?BCDCEFG=@@EAHAIHCE<=>?@A?BCDCEFJG=@@EAHAIHCE    \(11  A SNP constituting a rule with high scores usually shows a high frequency of its minor allele in the corresponding population. For instance, with regard to genotypes rs1553533 and rs1553554, one of the two genotypes is found overwhelmingly more often than the other in Surui population. Other than this information, however, no studies have been conducted on the relations between populations and the SNPs extracted in the rules In order to work around this problem, we examined the association between SNPs and traits in a coarser level. In this experiment, we examined the association between the SNPs and the geographical regions. In our dataset, multiple populations are mapped to a geographical region. The results are shown in Table 2 We also used 0.3 for both Rule Confidence and Population Support for this experiment. The rules 


found in this experiment retain F-scores lower than those in Table 1 This outcome seems to stem from the increased heterogeneity of the individuals in the same class \(i.e., geographical region KLMNOPQRSTTU  V9 suggests that rs256871 SNP has some relation with Asian populations. Our literature survey discovered an association between them such that rs256871 SNP is part of SEPT8 gene, and, in turn the SEPT8 gene is known to be accountable for tuberculosis among Asians [12 Nonetheless, most of the rules found in this study were difficult to interpret, because, out of more than 660,000 SNPs used in the study, very small numbers of such SNPs had been subject to research for  3 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218008T 4 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218014Q 322 determining the relations with particular traits such as population and geographical region.

Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
