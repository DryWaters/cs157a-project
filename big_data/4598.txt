INTRODUCTION  Different shelf has different promotion effect for retail merchandise High effect shelves which can be defined as shelves with fitting height, location etc, can play higher promotion effect on demand Apparently, shelves with high effect are important and sparse resource of retail stores since a great quantity of products compete the limited shelf space for effectively display. It has acknowledged that displayed inventory on shelf space has an effect on sales for many retail products   Mantrala revealed that a good assortment of displayed items can increase customersê perception of shopping convenience and improve their loyalty   particu lar  Wong pointed out that displayed products assortment should be adjusted to account for shifting consumer profile and lifestyle tren a rs on etc called t h e  displayed inventory which is carried to stimulate demand èpsychic stockê and suggested èfull-shelf merchandisingê policy a de a s e rie s of field experiments and found that location of the product within a display, especially the level of shelf on which the product is displayed in case of multi-level shelf, has different effect on sales Because sales of displayed inventory can be increased by attracting the consumerês attention and encouraging consumers to have additional purchase opportunities product assortment for shelf space has been considered as an important decision to retailers. The product assortment problem is concerned with the optimum use of shelves to provide a complete assortment of products meeting the customerês needs, or say, the problem is to determine the variety of products to be displayed on the shelves that have the greatest value to customers so as to maximize retailerês profit Due to the space limitation of high effect shelf, retailers can only display few products available from suppliers Therefore, high effect shelf is an import resource for gaining profit. For making the best of shelf space sometimes, retailers need to abandon some low-profit items in high effect shelf and transfer these shelves to high-profit items. What items should be discarded is a difficult decision problem. The difficulty is that the profit of one item not only comes from its own sales but also from its influence on the sales of other items i.e., the "cross demand effect". Another challenge to the product assortment problem is that customerês demands are ever-changing. The demand intensity for product would change with time. This dynamic nature of demand makes both the direct profit and indirect profit from cross demand effect of a product change with time Thus, the product assortment should be dynamically changed with time so as to make the shelf allocation respond the changing demand in dynamic market The increase of electronic data gathering devices, such as point-of-sale technologies, has made it easier for retailers to collect data, and some knowledge about customer behavior can be learned from these data Furthermore, the retailer can roughly estimate customerês demand before the sale begins through analyzing historical data and fine-tune this estimation by using real time sales data. Through estimating customersê demand intensity for various products and analyzing their purchasing pattern, retailer can observe a product assortmentês marketing effect in a simulated setting for intending sale horizon. In this paper, a transaction simulation approach is presented, and a dynamic product assortment algorithm is developed through analyzing simulated transaction data The remainder of this paper is organized as follows related researches are reviewed in next part of this section. Section 2 gives the problem definition. The transaction simulation approach is depicted in Section 3 Section 4 describes how to estimate direct and indirect profit with simulated data. Then, in Section 5, a genetic algorithm for dynamic product assortment is introduced Experiments results are addressed in section 6. This paper ends with concluding remarks in Section 7  1.1 Related researches  Product assortment problem of high effect shelf management can be defined as the process to select products in business for display in high effect shelf 978-1-4244-6487-6/10/$26.00  2010 IEEE 


 space. The measurement of demand effects which has been widely used to estimate the relationship between sales and allocated space, is the main challenge for this problem. Demand effects can be divided into two types direct demand effect and cross-demand effect. Direct demand effect is used to measure the effect on demand by changing the display space for product, and the cross-demand effect of a target product is measured to estimate the effect on demand of other products by changing the display space for this product Anderson and Amato formulated the product assortment optimization model as a knapsack problem, in which only the direct demand effect was considered [6  Hansen and Heinsbroek also estimated the direct demand effects in their mathematical programming  Corstjens and Doyle developed a generalized geometric programming model with both the direct effects and cross effects of deman Z u f r y d en pres en ted  dynamic programming approach to solve the model of Corstjens and Doyle, in which the integer solutions can be provided through allowing the consideration of general objective function requirements [9 ss demand effect was considered in Borinês optimization model, and simulated annealing algorithm was suggested as a solution methodology  integrated the inventory control model with the product assortment m y pe of m u l tico n s trai n t  knapsack model for the shelf space allocation developed by Yang, take display space and shelf location into consideration  presen ted a genetic algorithm to optimize shelf space design and item allocation [13   However, high cost of experiment is needed to measure direct demand effect and cross demand effect in above-mentioned model. To overcome this drawback some data mining-based approaches were proposed Brijs proposed a model celled PROFSET to solve the product assortment problem in convenience stores, in which cross demand effect can be measured by association rules g  dra w a n a n alogy bet w e e n  this cross demand effect and the mutual reinforcement of hub/authority web pages and applies the hub-authorityé profit ranking approach to solve the maximal profit item-selection problem g  proposed a novel approach with consideration of the loss ruleÑa rule similar to the association ruleÑto model the cross demand effect   2. PROBLEM DEFINITION  Given a items set I with n different items I 1  I 2  I n  let I  I 1  I 2  I n We supposed that only m items can be displayed in high effect shelf space for a selling horizon. Before the sale begins, the seller conducts market researches such as market surveys or historical data analysis, to forecast the customer arrival number N  and each productês sale quantity i Q The decision horizon can be separated into T discrete epochs to make each epoch short enough that within each epoch there is almost one customer arrival. Thus, the arrival rate of each epoch can be calculated by  T N   The probability that an arrival customer would purchase the ith product is T Q i i   Let vector    1   2   n  denote the estimated purchasing probabilities for all items in set I We refer to the profit of an item coming from its own sales as direct profit, the profit coming from "cross demand effect" as indirect profit. As defined by Brijs etc [14, 15, 16 e cros s de m a n d e f f e c t can be  measured by association rules Because customersê purchasing patterns are relatively steady, an itemês direct profit and indirect profit mainly rest with demand intensity parameters  and  We supposed that m different items should be selected for high effect shelf space. Let I D  be the set of selected items, and D I V   be the set of reserved items. Let       D D R  be the direct profit of D when demand parameters are  and  Let       V D R  denote indirect profit of D due to cross demand effects on V. Then the total profit of D is given by                  V D D D D R R R   1 Suppose that retailer determines to select m different items from set I for the sake of making the best of high effect shelf space. The problem researched in this paper is how to partition set I into two subsets D and V. The goal of partition is that profit from set D should be as high as possible  3.

Let x  x   I\ item in business apparently s  x      U card x card is the frequent degree of item x If s  x   we call x frequent item Assumption 1 High effect Shelf space should display items that are sufficient to attract customer. The frequent degree s  x just reflects how much customers are interested by the item x Thus only frequent item can be candidate for displaying in high effect shelf space According to assumption 1, we just need to simulate the transaction containing frequent item Definition 1 if X is a frequent items set and card  X  k  then X is called k frequent items set and denoted by k X If frequent item sets k X and i k X  satisfy 


 k X  i k X  then i k X  can be called super frequent item set of k X  Apparently, any item x in frequent item set k X  is also a frequent item, and the set x can be called 1-frequent item set Definition 2 if a transaction contains frequent item set k X but not contains any super frequent item set of k X then we call this transaction according with the purchasing pattern k X  The k X  is called k pattern Let set   denote the set of all the super frequent item set of k X The number of all the transactions that accord with k X   can be calculated as follow        1 X 1  X   X   X   k k k k card card card 2 Let an item x i  X k If a transaction contains item x i then the conditional probability that this transaction accords with pattern X k can be calculated as follow     X    X  Pr i k i k x card card x  3 According to the generalized total probability formula the probability that an arrival customerês transaction pattern accords to k X  can be calculated by     k i X x i k i k x  X  Pr  X  Pr  4 Assumption 2 Purchasing patterns corresponding to customer behavior can be discovered in the transaction data set, and these patterns will remain unchanged in relatively short time horizon Assumption 3 A customer buys only one unit of a certain product in same transaction Frequent item set can be discovered in historical transaction data set, and according to assumption 2, its frequent degree s X\ill remains steady Let t  t 1,2ÉT\denote the index of epoch in a decision horizon.

GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR ITEMS SELECTION 


  Wong has proved that the maximal-profit item selection problem researched in this paper is NP-hard. Thus a genetic algorithm is used for this problem. The genetic algorithm can be viewed as an optimization method which encodes a possible solution of a problem in a chromosome-like data structure. This approach creates a number of chromosomes in a population and finds a solution by rearranging the chromosomes in the population. Some key steps of this approach are described as follow  5.1 Encoding  For the encoding, we take a string of 0's and 1's which is called a chromosome. First, set index for each item in set I, and the bit position of a chromosome string is the index of each item. If the value of a bit is 1, it means that the corresponding item is selected in set D. If the value of a bit is 0, the item is selected into set V. e.g. if the coding of a certain chromosome is 001100É, this encoding means that item #3 and #4 are selected into D and item #1, #2, #5, #6 are selected into V  5.2 Fitness function  When items in set D are selected to be displayed in shelf space, the total profit of set D      D R can be estimated by above-mentioned estimation algorithm which is based on transaction simulation  5.3 Initial solution population  Let T r x x    be the direct profit estimation of the item x. For forming initial chromosome, we just rank items by their direct profit estimation from high to low and set different selected probability accordingly for them: setting higher selected probability for the item with higher profit, setting lower selecting probability for the item with lower profit. We select the items stochastically according to their selected probability. If an item is selected, itsê bit value in a chromosome is marked as ç1é, otherwise, marked as ç0é. When we have selected m items, one chromosome is formed After a chromosome is formed, we can repeat this step from the beginning until k initial chromosomes are formed  5.4 Crossover and Mutation  1. The genetic algorithm firstly randomly selects pairs of individual chromosomes for reproducing next generation. The probability of a chromosome being selected is proportional to its fitness function value 2. Comparing the bit value of parent chromosomes, and entail the bit with same position value to offspring chromosomes. Now there are still some bits without value in the offspring chromosomes, this means that these bits have not inherited value from parent chromosomes. In order to ensure that there are just m bits with value 1 in offspring chromosomes, crossover operator should continue steps as follow a  Working out the number of bits with value 1 on the offspring chromosome. Suppose there are r bits with value ç1é, then there will be m-r bits to get value 1 in those bits without value b  Getting out all the bit position index of bits without value. According to these position indexes scan all the bit values at the same position in parent chromosomes. If there is a bit with value 1 at the same position in either of the parent chromosomes, then set the bit in offspring chromosome with value 1 c  Repeat b\til the number of bits with value 1 becomes m. Set value 0 for other empty bits 3. After crossover procedure, we get some offspring chromosomes from previous generation chromosomes Then Select one chromosome from the offspring chromosomes with a low probability \(for example the probability 0.5%\n mutation process. In order to ensure that there are just m bits with value 1 in a chromosome after mutation, we do the following mutation operation to the chromosome a  Select one bit from bits with value 0 stochastically and change the value to 1 b  Select one bit from bits with value 1 stochastically and change the value to 0  6 EXPETIMENT   From the observation on transaction records in a certain convenience store in Shanghai, we obtained a set transaction sample of 300 kinds of items in fifteen days The quantity of shelves with high effect is relatively small. Having calculated the probability distribution of each item or items combination purchased from sample data, we work out 70 frequent item set. Then we designed a simulation program to produce transaction data during a period of time  Table 1 Comparison between two methods  m Profitability of m items Genetic algorithm Direct profit ranking 20 30 40 50 60 70 31 37 41 46 51 57 21 23 27 31 36 41  The results of the experiments are shown in table 1. In the table 1, the figure m denotes the number of items selected to be displayed in high effect shelf. we measure the total profit \(direct and indirect profit m selected items, and the profitability is the percentage of the total profit in all the simulated data set. Table 1 demonstrates the comparison of profit effect by two items selection methods when m varies. The average profitability of genetic algorithm is 48% higher than direct profit ranking method  


 7. CONCLUSION   In this paper, we explored how to optimize product assortment of high effect shelf. A simulation-based genetic algorithm is developed which can find optimal solution according the demand parameters. The simulation module makes the fitness function value of genetic algorithm keep consistent with the future demand state. Thus, the genetic algorithm can adjust product assortment if the demand state change at any time. The experiment result shows that approach presented in this paper can make full use of high effect shelf space of a retail store  REFERENCES  1  Murali, K.

Fig 5 Visualization of the future paths considered by the A controller Each read line shows a possible future trajectory for Mario taking the dynamic nature of the world into account not the case Instead a more accurate representation of the distance to the goal can be given by simulating the time required to reach the right border of the window Here the current speed of Mario is taken into account The quickest solution to get to the goal would then be to accelerate as fast as possible and taking the required time as a heuristic Similarly the previous distance of a node to the starting node is simply the time it took to reach the current node c Variable Optimisation While the A search algorithm is quite solid and guarantees optimality certain restrictions need to be put on its execution time to stay within the allowed 40ms for each game update These restrictions will likely lead to a non-optimal solution so careful testing has to be undertaken to ensure that the search terminates The 002rst restriction used was to stop looking for solutions when the time-limit had been reached and using the node with the best heuristic so far as a goal node The linear level design created by the level generator in In\002nite Mario favors this approach as it does not feature dead ends that would require back-tracking of suboptimal paths The requirement that the heuristic has to be admissible has also been relaxed A slightly overestimating heuristic increases the speed of the algorithm in expense of accurac In detail the estimation of the remaining distance can be multiplied with a factor w   1  Experimentation with different values for w  led to an optimal factor of w  1  11  Another factor that has an effect on the processing time required by A is the frequency of plan recalculation As mentioned above limited information requires a recalculation of the plan once new information becomes available i.e obstacles or enemies enter the window of visible information Experimentation indicated that the best balance between planning ahead and restarting the planning process to incorporate new information is given when the plan is recreated every two game updates Planning longer in advance occasionally led to reacting too late to previously unknown threats resulting in a lost life or slowdown of Mario B Other A*-based controllers Two other controllers were submitted that were based on the A algorithm One was submitted by Peter Lawford and the other by a team consisting of Andy Sloane Caleb Anderson and Peter Burns we will refer to this team with Andy's name in the score tables These submission were inspired by Robin's controller and used a similar overall approach but differed signi\002cantly in implementation C Other hand-coded controllers The majority of submitted controllers were hand-coded and did to our best knowledge not use any learning algorithms nor much internal simulation of the environment Most of these continuously run rightwards but use heuristics to decide when and how to jump Some were built on one of the standard heuristic controllers supplied with the competition software The following are very due to space limitations brief characterizations of each 1 Trond Ellingsen Rule-based controller Determines a 223danger level\224 of each gap or enemy and acts based on this 2 Sergio Lopez Rule-based Answers the questions 223should I jump?\224 and 223which type of jump?\224 heuristically by evaluating danger value and possible landing points 3 Spencer Schumann A standard reactive heuristic controller from the example software augmented with a calculation of desired jump length based on internal simulation of Mario's movement Incomplete tracking of enemy positions 4 Mario Perez Subsumption controller inspired by controllers used in behaviour-based robotics 5 Michal Tulacek Finite state machine with four states walk-forward  walk-backward  jump and jump-hole  6 Rafel Oliveira Reactive controller did not submit any documentation 7 Glenn Hartmann Based on an example controller Shoots continuously jumps whenever needed D Learning-based controllers A number of controllers were submitted that were developed using learning algorithms in one way or another These controllers exhibit a fascinating diversity still due to space considerations and paucity of submitted documentation also these controllers will only be described summarily 1 Matthew Erickson Controller represented as expression tree evolved with fairly standard crossover-heavy Genetic Programming using CompetitionScore as 002tness The tree evaluates to four boolean values left/right jump run and duck Nonterminal nodes where chosen among standard arithmetic and conditional functions The terminals were simple hard-coded feature detectors 2 Douglas Hawkins Based on a stack-based virtual machine evolved with a genetic algorithm 3 Alexandru Paler An intriguing combination of imitation learning based on data acquired from human playing and path-\002nding A is used to 002nd the route to the end of the screen the intermediate positions form inputs to a neural network trained on human playing which returns the number and type of key presses necessary to get there 


4 Sergey Polikarpov Based on the 223Cyberneuron\224 architecture 8 and trained with a form of reinforcement learning A number of action sequences are generated and each is associated with a neuron this neuron is penalized or rewarded depending on Mario's performance while the action sequence is being executed 5 Erek Speed Rule-based controller evolved with a GA Maps the whole observation space  22 002 22  onto the action space resulting in a genome of more than 100 Mb VII R ESULTS The 002rst phase of the competition was associated with the ICE-GIC conference in London and the results of the competition presented at the conference The results are presented in table I and show that Robin Baumgarten's controller performed best very closely followed by Peter Lawford's controller and closely followed by Andy Sloane et al.'s controller We also include a simple evolved neural network controller and a very simple hard-coded heuristic controller  ForwardJumpingAgent which was included with the competition software and served as inspiration for some of the competitors for comparison none of the agents that were not based on A outperformed the heuristic controller TABLE I R ESULTS OF THE ICE-GIC PHASE OF THE COMPETITION  Competitor progress ms/step Robin Baumgarten 17264 5.62 Peter Lawford 17261 6.99 Andy Sloane 16219 15.19 Sergio Lopez 12439 0.04 Mario Perez 8952 0.03 Rafael Oliveira

CIG conference in Milan Italy and the results presented there For this phase we had changed the scoring procedure as detailed in section IV-A A wise move as both Robin Baumgarten's and Peter Lawford's agent managed to 002nish all of the levels and Andy Sloane et al.'s came very close In compliance with our own rules Robin rather than Peter was declared the winner because of it being faster having more in-game time left at the of all levels It should be noted that Peter's controller was better at killing enemies though The best controller that was not based on A that of Trond Ellingsen scored less than half of the A agents The best agent developed using some form of learning or optimization that of Matthew Erickson was even further down the list This suggests a massive victory of classic AI approaches over CI techniques At least as long as one does not care much about computation time if score is divided by average time taken per time step the extremely simple heuristic ForwardJumpingAgent wins the competition 8 http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0229 VIII D ISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS While the objective for the competitors was to design or learn a controller that played In\002nite Mario Bros as well as possible the objective for the organizers was to organize a competition that accurately tested the ef\002cacy of various controller representations and learning algorithms for controlling an agent in a platform game Here we remark on what we have learned in each of these respects using the software in your teaching and the future of the competition A AI for platform games By far the most surprising outcome of the competition was how well the A*-based controllers performed compared to all other controller architectures including controllers based on learning algorithms As A is a commonly used algorithm for path-\002nding in many types of commercial computer games e.g RTS and MMORPG games one could see this as a victory over 223classical\224 AI over more fancy CI techniques which are rarely used in the games industry However one could also observe that the type of levels generated by the level generator are much less demanding and deceiving than those found in the real Super Mario Bros games and other similar games All the levels could be cleared by constantly running right and jumping at the right moments there were no hidden objects and passages and in particular there were no dead ends that would require backtracking All the A*based agents consume considerably more processing time when in front of vertical walls where most action sequences would not lead to the right end of the screen suggesting that A would break down when faced with a dead end While the sort of search in game-state space that the A algorithm provides is likely to be an important component in any agent capable of playing arbitrary Mario levels it will likely need to be complemented by some other mechanism for higher-level planning and the architecture will probably bene\002t from tuning by e.g evolutionary algorithms Further the playing style exhibited by the A*-based agents is nothing like that exhibited by a human player the creepy exactness and absence of deliberation seems part of what made the YouTube video of Robin's agent so popular How to create a controller that can learn to play a platform game in a human-like style is an industrially relevant cf Demo Play  problem which has not been addressed by this competition B Competition organization Looking at the objectives enumerated in section IV we consider that the 002rst two objectives  ease of participation and transparency  have been ful\002lled the third  ease of 002nding a winner  could have been met better and that we largely failed at meeting the fourth  depth of challenge  Ease of participation was mainly achieved through having a simple web page simple interfaces and letting all competition software be open source Participation was greatly increased through the very successful media campaign built on social media Transparency was achieved through forcing all submissions to be open source and publishing them on

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
