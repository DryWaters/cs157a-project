A Bayesian network can be considered to be a powerful tool for various analyses \(e.g. inference analysis sensitivity analysis, evidence propagation, etc.\owever, it is first necessary to obtain the Bayesian network structure of a given dataset, and this, an NP hard problem, is not an easy task. Among the available scoring metrics, the present study employed Mutual Information Test \(MIT\ construct a Bayesian network from the event logs of port logistics data covering six days of observations. Additionally, dynamic 
programming was used to shorten the combinatorial calculation of the metrics and, later, to minimize the computation time. To validate our method, we conducted a case study of port processes using actual event logs from an Asian port

 I NTRODUCTION  Currently many businesses are supported by information systems that provide insight into what actually happens in business process execution. This abundant data has been studied mainly in the growing research area of process mining [1e of t h e i m p o rtan t perf or m a n c e m o n itori ng  concerns is the execution pattern. Suppose that a process

contains an OR, according to which, it can follow one course or another course: Which is it more likely to follow Any different flows can differentiate the final result \(e.g total execution time; required resources, etc.\ that process. It should be clear, then, that an event of a process might contain many other attributes, which, in the cases of some complex business processes [9m a y  h a v e t e ns or  even hundreds of attributes. Thus, determining which attributes influence a given pattern is not straightforward To accommodate this process pattern uncertainty, in the present study, we employed a Bayesian network to determine which attributes cause a particular kind of process flow In our previous work w e u s ed a depen den c y  g raph  retrieved by Heuristic Mine an d dec om pos ed any  
cycles found into a non-cycle structure. This methodology though enabling quick retrieval of the constructed Bayesian network, has drawbacks relating to the fact that its noncycle structure is dependent solely on the structure of the dependency graph. In other words, we have to take due note of the fact that the structure is supported only by the successive occurrences between activities and not by the common information shared. To remedy this shortcoming in the present study we refine our previous work by developing a dynamic programming procedure of mutual information score using Mutual Information Test \(MIT  The data used to calculate MIT score was originally not in a form of event logs, and, indeed, MIT was not designed for

Since a case in the event logs contains a sequential process execution, we can assume that the data in the event logs is ordered.

 Fig.  1 Let us assume that for each MIT local score we need to find the minimum score such that the th local score is from the minimum 1\th local score. Unlike the recursive procedure, we would like to start our procedure from the bottom up and move incrementally to the th step from the minimum th step. The formal definition of the recurrence is 1 12 12  1          min 2  6 where 1    is the minimum th local score that has parents 1 that yield the minimum local score for the th steps, and 1 2  calculates the mutual information score by adding   The mutual information score for finding each parent of a random variable is similar to that in equation \(5 Suppose that ou r recurrence for 1    for the th step, is correct Accordingly, we consider two options for calculation of the  th step: 1\ the calculation of 12    where there is no contribution from the addition of the remaining random variables as the parents of 2\ the addition of 12    and the remaining random variable\(s\ denoted   if by adding it\(them\better mutual inform ation scor e of in th step is made. The minimization of the th step will lead to the minimization of the th step. Thereby, our algorithm will find the optimal mutual information score. The base case is obviously 0  0 where    Our algorithm has the computational complexity of  2   for random variables and candidate parents for each random variable The procedure for finding the parent\(s\ of 1 using the same example from the beginning of this section. The process starts from the bottom and gradually inserts, in sequence, the remaining parents of 1 The last iteration shows the optimal mutual information score for 1 denoted 3 113   The complete Bayesian network for the example is shown in Fig. 1 IV C ASE S TUDY  One hundred and eighty \(180\ the 500 port logistics operations in the world are required to serve more than onehalf million TEU \(Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit annually; this fact has compelled the adoption of more efficient operations. Most port logistics operations currently are supported by information systems that store actual operation records. Employing this data, and using the process mining technique, port managers can obtain useful insights into what actually happens in the port logistics process execution. Moreover, since port logistics are prone not only to complexity but also uncertainty, in this study we employed the Bayesian network to investigate port logistics performance Fig. 2 shows port logistics process in BPMN 2.0 notation. Port logistics event logs obtained consists of 395 process instances and 1009 events. It covers six days of observation, and includes the discharging and transshipment processes. The discharging process discharges a container from a vessel for stacking in the yard, after which it is either brought out of the port as an outbound container, or loaded onto another vessel. Due to privacy issues, some of the contents have been masked; this did not affect the study results. The events \(activities\ include yard operations for container discharge ay operations for container discharge yard operations for container loading  pluggings for reefer container container shuffling  ay operations for container loading d yard operations for container gate out event is represented as a random variable, the state\(s\ which is are\ attribute\(s\value in the event logs, \(i.e. the value of the originator or of another data attributes Each event in the same process instance is ordered based on its timestamp. This facilitates construction of a Bayesian network, since the parent of a given event is actually an event that previously occurred. To that end, first, we list the random variables, and their respective candidate parents and states from the event logs. For convenience, each random variable is represented as its abbreviation  and For instance, a variable has its candidate parent\(s whereas has an empty set of candidate parents, since we cannot find any predecessor of event in the event logs. The following is a complete list of events and their respective candidate parents and states

The states are those of the originators, which in this case are quay cranes and yard cranes To learn the Bayesian network from event logs, we apply our proposed calculation steps to our case study. First, the variable with an empty set of candidate parents is left as it is Afterwards, starting from the first variable, we calculate the local score according to equation \(5\. Since has only one parent \(as do and e calculation will be straightforward. For and each having two parents The results indicate that between the two candidate parents there is only one parent for both and This is due to the fact that 1  and 1  are smaller than 1   and 1  respectively The local score calculation of denoted as  on this basis, we also gain the actual parents of which are       The complete Bayesian network in our case study is illustrated in Fig. 3 \(a\. 3\(b\ includes the attributes from the event logs, and also shows the observation of originator in  and the flow traversing through that affects the posterior probability of being late in the container loading process of which also can be expressed as   01   61   0.0002 meanwhile Fig. 3\(c\ shows the posterior probability distribution of each possible state in the random variables After the Bayesian network is retrieved, the network analysis, which includes inference analysis, sensitivity analysis, and others, can be performed Causal inference Causal inference can also be used to investigate the cause of working delays. In w e  n o ted th e la ten e s s  inference of an overall process given one delay in an event For example, if the container placement in the yard for loading preparation ertain, then the probability of the container loading process become late for Vessel is 0.0211 and, eventually, the probability of container loading process being on time is 97.88 Backward inference Backward inference is used to find the probability of the opposite direction of causal inference, that is, the probability of the caused random variable where the affected random variable is known. For instance, the probability that a container going off port through the container gate out  is a reefer plugging container, is denoted    and is 0.017.  It should be noted that only reefer containers go through reefer plugging event In this study, using the same means of retrieving the reefer plugging container probability, we could determine that the probability of those containers having been through a shuffling event \(SF\as 0.015 Explaining-away inference Suppose that a port manager wants to know which event has a higher chance of triggering a gate-out process: YD, SF RP or a combination thereof. Using explaining-away inference this time, the port manager can predict this. A more interesting analysis that can be employed using explaining-away inference is the ability to infer any possible patterns influenced by each random variable state\(s\As an example, assume YD and QD as an event with yard cranes and container-bound remarks as its states, respectively. It can be inferred that any yard cranes carrying a container with çtransshipmenté as its remark is more likely, with the probability of 0.09, to execute YL than another process This way, if YD and QD are certain, we can obtain a clearer understanding of the probability of transshipment occurring

  Fi g 3 V C ONCLUSIONS  This study refined our previous investigation into Bayesian network generation. In that earlier study, we decomposed any cycles found in a dependency graph into a Bayesian network. However, in such a case, the non-cycles structure remains as the original dependency graph structure Moreover, the dependency graph is derived from the Heuristic miner algorithm, which derivation does not follow the principle of Bayesian network construction, namely dependency \(independency\mong vertices. To remedy this shortcoming, in the present investigation, we employed mutual information test \(MIT o construct the Bayesian network. MIT was not originally designed for the field of business process management, and so the data set used to calculate MIT is not in the form of event logs. Thus, we propose dynamic programming for MIT calculation. Our proposed method was proved to entail less computational complexity than the recursive procedure for the original MIT calculation. Moreover, we validated our method using real port process analysis. The case study reported in these pages covered six days of observation and involved almost four hundred process instances. Considering that event logs contain time-series data, we would like to enhance this method in a more applicative direction, specifically with respect to the order Markov chain in a dy namic Bayesian network A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea NRF\ed by the Ministry of Education \(2013013143 and the National Research Foundation of Korea \(NRF\ grant funded by the Korean government \(MEST\ \(No 2012R1A1A2008335 R EFERENCES  1

 However, this does not return the result expected, explained as follows. The number of tuples in the Chunk table grows as the number of columns in Private table grows. In our running example, since each tuple is represented in two columns in the Chunk table, we cannot assume that the number of entries for Tenant 17 would be a multiple of a fixed number \(2, in our case List the hospitals and their number of beds For the Index table layout For Chunk table layout, this query could be expressed as Note a restriction here which assumes, by default, that State is assumed is of type Str1, which may not be true Find number of beds for Tenant 17 For the Index table layout, this query is formulated as follows The above query could not be expressed for the Chunk Table layout since selecting any value from the attribute çInt1é would include values corresponding to other possible attributes of all the tenants Find details of tenant, aid, name, and hospitals For the Index table  This query cannot be expressed over the Chunk Table layout Find details of hospitals and beds for each tenant This query for the Index table layout can be expressed as follows, which includes two join operations over the common attributes among the tables, namely ext_base ext_hospital, and ext_beds This query is not possible to express for the Chunk Table layout. This is because in a Chunk table, data values of similar type are stored in one column, and hence having predicates over Tenant, Chunk, and row in the WHERE clause do not help in retrieving the right data.While queries of types 0, 1, and 2 measure expressivity of the schema, we also compare the Chunk table and Index table layouts based on their space requirements. In the Index table layout, common data among tenants is always stored in the base table. The supporting tables would only include necessary rows. This reduces the space utilization to a large extent. We hence compare the sizes of Chunk table and the Base table of the Index table layout. Figure 7 illu strates the results of this comparison V CONCLUSION We studied suitable date models for multi-tenant databases, which is important to manage big data in the context of cloud computing paradigm. We proposed a data model that improves chunk model in space utilization as well as query processing. The correctness of the proposed model was discussed and illustrated through various query types We note that in terms of space, the Index table layout takes almost two third of the space taken by the Chunk table layout. We observe that the query processing times of Index table layout for queries of Type 0 improve by an order of magnitude. We also observe that the query processing times for queries that can be posed both against the Chunk table and the Index table layout \(Type 1\most the same. We compile an exhaustive set of queries as Type 2. These queries could not be supported by the Chunk table layout. This is due to the inflexibility of the Chunk table layout and poor design. Since the Index table layout is a ver tically partitioned schema, we can take advantage of column store features. This is an advantage as most of the queries for SaaS are posed on individual columns The index column of the base table can be further indexed, sorted or even hashed if the application demands  This is useful in case the schema has to be

further extended to a data warehouse like application scenario as many CUBE operations involve individual columns. The result of our experiments and analyses indicate that our proposed Index layout is more expressive than the Chunk table layout, and results in much improvemen t in performance in terms of space utilization through compression and is more expressive for supporting a wider range of query types. Its vertical partitioning and its column-store like design leads to significant increase in query processing performance. Other advantage of the Index table layout is that the mapping step of the Index table is much less complicated than that of Chunk Folding    Figure 7.

All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
