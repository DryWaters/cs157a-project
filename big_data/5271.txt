The Dynamic Data Reduction and Association Rule Parallel Mining Based on Rough Set He Youquan , and Wang LiJun  Information Science & Engineering Department, Chongqing Jiaotong University, Chongqing, China \( hyq123003@163.com Abstract\227 To dynamic increasing databases, the data dynamic reduction and decision-making rule mining are treated by the methods of repeat scan, order, search, reduction data set traditionally, this paper proposes a new mining algorithm, which trea 
t two dispart table simultaneously by using program\222 many course parallel technology. This method improves greatly mining efficiency of the system, is of important reference meaning to da ta reduction and association rule mining of the large dynamic increasing databases  Key words\227 data mining, data reduction, association rule, parallel mining

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
