But for larger N, the number of sample po ints, is selected, not only windows effect is reduced and f requency resolution is improved but also export that the frequency domain signal to noise ratio is N times increase of time-domain. So when N is a greater value using DFT measuring frequency algorithm can detect small signal submerged in the noise A realization scheme is given based on the big point DFT radar reconnaissance digital receiver, and export the quantitative relationship about sense pulse modulation radar signals. With the development of component technology and improvement of algorithm long-data DFT has sufficient computing speed now, which provides the probability of its application in digital receiver Long FFT use generally 2-dimension algorithm and its implementation method on FPGA are also talked about  Key words digital receiver, DFT, windows effect, signal to noise ratio, FFT  I I NTRODUCTION Radar reconnaissance digital receiver is a embranchment of modern electron warfare reconnaissance receiver, which used to obtain the enemy's rad ar information, and it is a important component of electronic intelligen ce  safeguard system 1 In order to detect complex unknown signal in a modern high-density, highly com plex environment of the electronic signals to demand the receiver to transmit high bandwidth, high sensitivity an d resolution, large dynamic information, signal can long-term storage for later analysis and the application of flexib le signal processing methods capable of handling si gnals arrived at the same time, other information is not lost as fast-Transform targets etc. The scheme commonly used about radar reconnaissance digital receiver are: direct DFT transform digital receiver, lack of sampling multi-channel pa rallel digital receiv ers, frequency channel digital receiver and booting digital receivers 2  DFT is the most commonly used signal processing technology, has got considerable attention sin ce long period The application of DFT technology in the receiver can overcome single-bit receivers can not handle multiple signals get simultaneously, nor the broa dband signal cross-channel issues in the frequency channel receiver. More important is the distribution of time-frequency signal which bases on the STFT \(short-time Fourier transf orm\given and can have a more profound cognition to the signal structur e when the data processing subsection. Limited by devices computational capabilities, receiver us ed to adopt short data DFT measuring-frequency methods. When the reconnaissance target is locked for the pulse radar signals because of this signal mostly is the unknown parameters of the cycle signals, the time-frequency analysis function of short data DFT isn’t role play. On the contrary, the use of the big points DFT measuring-frequency methods, on the one hand can reduce the effect of window domino effect to DFT and increase measuring-frequency accuracy of the signals, on the other hand through th e accumulation of DFT, will be able to detection the weak Radar signal hide the noise. With the level progress of de vice and improvement of the algorithm the constraint of the big points DFT is broke through in computational capabilities, it have practical application in radar reconnaissance digital receiver II C HARACTERISTICS OF DFT A  DFT definition Fourier transform is a tran sformation tools between the time domain and frequency domain, Fourier transform, in essence, is constituted of many different frequency sine or cosine waves which time-domain signal will be broken down into , and this could be transform the Research of signal  xn into the study of th eir weights. But the spectrum by the Fourier is the de mographic characteristics of the signal, it is the integral about whole time-domain, any moment of time-domain waveform signals are included all the information in the frequency-domain Signals. So continuous Fourier transform is limited by time-domain function must be able to form that can be closed and difficulties in the calculation of con tinuous functions integral Therefore, in engineering applications, the real Fourier transform translate into the Discrete Fourier Transform to approximate calculation 3  Discrete Fourier Transform com putational formula is 1 0     0 1 N nk N n Xk DFTxn xnW k N         1 ______________________________________ 978-1-4244-2193-0/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE 


Direct calculate to complete full point DFT, the total amount of computation to the plural multiplication and the plural addition. The Fast Fourier Transform FFT\use of symmetry character and periodicity character the long sequence of DFT divided into short sequences DFT can great extent improve the computing speed. At present there are many fast algorithm for calculating the DFT, including ba se-2 FFT algorithm, base-4 FFT algorithm, split-base algorith m, the main factor decomposition algorithm, Winograd "small N" algorithm etc For FPGA Implementation, base-2 and base-4 algorithm is conformable big points FFT algorithm 4-5  2 N nk N W 1 NN   B  DFT windows effect In digital signal processi ng, the actual physical signals which need detect or process usually non-time limit, but as the restrictions such as computi ng speed and handle the workload and computer storage capacity, we can only select limited time-long data sample to be handled. This means that in the digital signal processing the original non-time limit signal must be cut off, which is equivalent to the original infinite raw data sequence data through a window Hypothesis enter sequence  x n  which length is N, its Fourier transform is  j X e  the choice of spectrum of window function is  wn  j We   well then the Fourier transform results Ye  j  of the sequence which comes from  yn  x n addition window is   1   DTFT      2 jj Ye xnwn Xe We d    j          2  By the theory of DFT, it is kn own that the DFT results of  is a uniform N discrete sampling points on the circle in fact. The effect of addition window on the DFT performs in reducing the frequ ency spectrum resolution and producing energy leakage. DFT resolution refers to the capacity of the two neighboring peak which can be distinguished in the real spectrum of the signal. The size of the resolution after addition window depends on the main valve width BW of the spectrum window, only the di stance of two frequency spectrum more than the width of the main valve about the spectrum window, the two peaks can be resolved out leakage of the spectrum is power or energy which concentrated in a narrow-band frequency Domain spreads to the nearby bands, this is th e result which true signal spectrum  yn  j X e   and the Side lobe of the spectrum window  j We   convolves.  As the existence of leakage domino effects, in the larger side lobe of spectrum window  j We   sometimes can cover up the smaller peaks of true spectrum  j  X e  or produce spectrum peaks does not exist in the real spectrum peaks at all. In order to reduce leakage domino effects, you can choose other smaller Side window function than the rectangular window. the main lobe of Window function spectrum is elected should try to narrow as much as possible so that energy can concentrated in the main lobe, so in spectrum analysis there has a higher frequency resolution, the height of the window spectrum side lobe as little as possible and with the frequen cy as soon as possible attenuation, accordingly reduce th e leakage distortion in the estimated spectrum When the sequence length N is larger, it equivalent the time-breadth of the window function which multiplied is longer, this can reduce the truncation function of the window signals contained in the se quence. From the frequency domain perspective, the frequency spectrum of window function becomes narrow and the frequency resolution is improved C  DFT signal Signal-to-No ise ratio on the increase For the plural Sine-sequence of Gaussian white noise expressed as 0 jn xAe     0,1 1 nvnn   N  3 0  is the signal’s digital frequency, then when 0 2 k 0  N   signal frequency matching the output spectrum of one DFT. Assumed that the noise in time-domain is not relevant, and in time-domain the noise power can be written as 2 012 Then corresponding noise power 2 f 012  in the frequency-domain is expressed as  11 2 2/2 00 2  2         NN jmkN jnkN fm mn jnnkN kE ve ve eNEvnvnN   012 012      n 1 0  N nn n EV kV Evv    015\015              4 This shows that in the frequency domain, the noise has the same distribution, but the variance increases N times Therefore there is 2 m f X  22 22 2  22 2 f SNAAS NN NN N 012\012\012 015 015      5 At 00 2 kN   time, the frequency signals do not match the output spectrum lines of a certain DFT and will reduce.

Especially when N is a greater value, reconnaissance receiver using DFT measuring frequency algorithm can detect small signal submerged in the noise. From another perspective, N point 


DFT equivalent of a coherent direction for accumulation. For the signal it has accumulation function, and the noise with stochastic range and phase is not accumulated III DFT BIG POINTS IN THE APPLICATION OF RECONNAISSANCE RECEIVER Despite the method of measuring the frequency based on DFT has disadvantage effect of the window domino effect, it also have the merits to overcome measured signals’ low signal to noise ratio and can detect signals at the same time reach.. Particularly with the development of FPGA devices the time which the big points FFT required substantially decline, so measuring frequency surveillance system based on the big points FFT, can greatly increase the detection probability of space weak signals and solve the problem about signal arrived at the same time A  application algorithm and quantitative analysis A big point DFT radar reconnaissance receiver designs as shown in Figure 1 Broadband analog sign al is converted by the A / D, at the first pass time-domain multiply window module, a re-N-point FFT computing \(N ranged from 256 K 1M\s to the frequency domain. After completion the frequency spectrum detection module searches whether radar signal is there. If the signal is detected there, then the more the signal separation, after the completion of separation using M point IFFT computing \(M adopt 64 K\the time-domain signal reconstruction. The signal is the narrow-band signal after the separation in general, so it can only take effective bandwidth of the frequency domain data M needs to fill zero to M point\nally give a complete pulse description of the word \(PDW\gnal separation through the time-domain detection module Fig 1  Operating flowchart of system Below is derived detection radar signal pulse modulation of the quantitative relationship, Assuming a sampling frequency S f FFT points N, IFFT points M, sampling interval and with the resolution frequency, respectively is 1 S t  f  6  S f fN   7 In FFT spectrum, the corresponding frequency value of the location point k is  s f f kf k N    8 After signal separation, to the FFT spectrum data which contains effectively bandwidth do M point I FFT transform transform it to the time domain and its resolution time is 1 s NN tt Mf Mf M       t  9 The sampling time of each swatch \(or detection time 0 TMtN    10 In IFFT results, the corresponding time value of the location point n is tnt    11 B  The rapid algorithm of DFT big points In order to improve the degree of parallel of the system and reduce the ne eds of memory capacity of the system, can change one-dimensional FFT points into the two-dimensional L M  treatment, that is, at first row transform then to line transform. Select rows transform L 1024 as a fixed point FFT, adopt base-4 algorithm to realize in order to reduce the demand of chip ping-pong memory line transform is 2 n M  variable points to transform FFT use base-2 algorithm to realize, to meet Requirements of the system points changing. In the system, the transformation between line and rows can be realized by two FPGA chip Data matrix between the two FPGA chip need to re-order, so the data need to go through cache, after multiplied by the rotating factor ,the transformation from rows FPGA transmit to line transform FPGA 7-8 Two-dimensional FFT / IFFT process Data rearrangement, N point data arrange L M  point format, including fixed L 1024 Each row of the matrix do fast Fourier transform, that is, do the M-L, one-dimensional FFT computing; Output of row Transform multiplied by the rotating factor keep into the middle of a data matrix \(L line M row\Each of the middle of the matrix will do Fast Fourier transform, that is, do L-M one-dimensional FFT computing; The whole sequence output For each level of transformation, since the array structure size too large, difficult to achieve, and the processing speed of recursive structure is slower, it will be difficult to achieve system requirements. Although parallel structure can achieve faster processing speed, too much demand about the butterfly computing unit and the wider memory bandwidth. It not only easy to structure the cascade of a pipeline handle mode enables the processor to achieve 100 percent efficiency, but also when the points need to changed the system easily reconstruct, so it becomes principal choice for structure of a high-speed real time variable-point FFT processor Based on the abov e analysis, FFT / IFFT subsystem major consists of two parts, shown in Fi gure 2. The main functions of the two modules are one-dimensional FFT processor, also including reading data circulation cascade structure control FFT processor modules accomplish line transform or row transform; Reading data cycle control module for the completion of the data generated address, read, reverse order and output variable operation and the realization of the control changing points function. Line transform FPGA holds the output of the first-class FFT \(intermediate data 


Reading data circulation control, and deliver to line transform FPGA. Data temporary memory for storing intermediate data, the rotation factor of memory for storing rotation factor, as the largest processing point for 1024 1024, the number of data and rotating factor is larger therefore, need to storage intermediate data by using the RAM chip, The ROM chip storage rotation factor. According to the real-time data processing speed of the external circuit decide whether need the import and export memory, if the processing speed of a applications system and processor FFT correspond, you can not use the input and output memory but need system to input FFT processor according to sequence the length of the system based on data in with the reverse requirements, and in time process the output of FFT processor Fig 2  Composing of FFT/IFFT module IV C ONCLUSIONS The realization of big points FFT in system-level FPGA for the radar detection receiver application the big points DFT provides a core guarantee. DFT using the big point of the channel could reduce the total number of channels, and can also bring into full play the advantages of the DFT points Based on the foregoing scheme, FFT transform points to 256 K, IFFT transform points to 64 K  the pulse radar signals reconnaissance receiver of 1 GHz bandwidth has been successfully applied R EFERENCES  Jam es Tsui, translate by  Yang Xiao niu Wideband digital receiver  Beijing China: Electronics Industry Publishing House, 2006  FU Yongqing, Li Yu B ased on the m u lti-phase filter channel receiver and its application research”,Signal processing,China, pp.517 520,May,2004  W a ng Shiy i Digital signal processin Beijing China: Beijing Institute of Technology press, 2001  Lu C, Cooley J W  Tollim ier i R, “FFT algor ith m s for prim e tr ansform  sizes and their implementations on VAX”, IBM3090VF, and IBM RS/6000.

transmitter and receiver This table would include entries such as the bandwidth modulation coding carrier frequency etc The next 16 bits of the R3 field define the number of frames remaining before the new format is to take effect This count field serves multiple purposes but in each case it allows adequate time for the receiver to prepare for the reconfiguration In a typical scenario the transmitter will determine that a format change is necessary at some point in the near future It announces the format change by beginning a countdown in the count field For example if each frame has a duration of 100 microseconds a format change 5 milliseconds in the future begins in 50 frames The count field in each subsequent frame would read 50 49 48 and so on The receiver tracks this countdown but also knows the duration of each frame and decrements its internal counter at the appropriate time whether it receives a frame or not As long as the receiver successfully receives even one frame during the countdown it will reach zero at the intended time If the transmitter does not wish to schedule a reconfiguration it can repeatedly transmit a large constant value in the count field Each received frame will reset the countdown timer and no reconfiguration will occur This practice doubles as a watchdog timer in the case where synchronization is lost if the receiver loses reception for an extended period of time it will automatically switch to the format specified in the last received frame In a cognitive radio for example this allows the transmitter to specify a backup format in the event of some unexpected interference Note that the receiver strips the R3 header both the format and count fields and only passes the frame data to downstream blocks 4 N bits 0--16 bits 16 bits Figure 8 Frame format for rapid runtime reconfig Configuration interface for R3 The host may not be fast enough to reconfigure the transmitter and/or receiver quickly enough to avoid loosing a significant amount of data A nontrivial amount of computation is required to determine the appropriate values for all the configuration registers On the other hand putting sufficient intelligence for reconfiguration into the FPGA firmware would be prohibitively complex A compromise is reached by having the host pre-compute all the register values and load them into a buffer The buffer contains a sequence of reconfiguration instructions consisting of an address and a data The FPGA firmware then generates a trigger to quickly execute all the instructions in the buffer The trigger is based on the R3 count field Once R3 reaches zero both the transmitter and receiver start the reconfiguration simultaneously A block diagram showing the host and the buffer is shown in Figure 9 Note that the host interface always has priority over the bus since there's no mechanism for reporting a pre-empted transfer The command buffer monitors the bus and injects commands only when the host is idle Host I Commad Transceiver Buffer start trigger Figure 9 Command buffer interface for R3 R3 Locking Behavior The rapid reconfiguration described above can take thousands of clock cycles and will typically cause the receiver to lose lock The transition from one format to the next cannot be easily scheduled to occur over just one sample The datapath in both transmitter and receiver is highly pipelined i.e the downstream blocks are processing older samples while the upstream blocks have already started processing new samples A seamless transition between the formats would require each of the blocks to be configured instantaneously and in a very precise sequence The sequencing would have to be precise to within a clock cycle This precision would be very difficult to achieve in general and especially since the configuration logic runs at a lower clock frequency than the signal processing logic Therefore at least one frame will be lost during the reconfiguration Typically a loss of lock is declared after missing unlock after consecutive frame headers and a lock is declared after seeing lock after consecutive frame headers Since the reconfiguration is known to cause a loss of lock the lock status should be reset at the start of the reconfiguration sequence This will allow the synchronization logic to immediately start looking for a new synch pattern and save the loss of unlock after frames In addition the timing tracking will unlock if the data rate in the new format differs from the previous format However the phase tracking should remain valid Invalid timing tracking output can cause the phase tracking to unlock if the decision directed phase error detector is used Therefore the phase tracking loop should be frozen at the beginning of the reconfiguration process and released at the end 5 


5 MULTIMEDIA SUBSYSTEM The VLC media player provides the video codec subsystem 7 This highly flexible open-source player integrates the video encoding streaming and decoding interfaces The player can be controlled via a Telnet connection providing the necessary automation interface to the DBRA controller The encoder captures raw data from a high-end webcam and encodes it into one of the supported formats The format selected for this research effort is H.264 a standard for video conferencing 8 This format can be configured for a wide range of data rates from a few dozen kbps to few Mbps The encoded data is streamed over the RTP/UDP 9 interface on the local computer A UDP client captures the packets and passes them to the transmitter If the UDP data rate exceeds the throughput of the waveform selected at the transceiver UDP packets are dropped After passing through the transmitter channel and the receiver the UDP packets are reconstructed by a UDP server The UDP server then streams the UDP packets on the receiver computer The UDP packets generated by the VLC include sufficient information about the video codec for the receiver to process them without any side-channel input Therefore the DBRA controller communicates video compression changes only to the transmitter-side VLC application TCP/IP Hardware Testbed Software defined radio opens a wide range of exciting opportunities No longer is a wireless link designed for the worst-case conditions only Instead the available bandwidth is optimally utilized over a range of conditions The average throughput and therefore average user experience is significantly improved This improvement comes at a cost of additional complexity at multiple layers of the communications protocol stack A designer must be aware of the ramifications of physical layer changes on the network and even application layers The design of the adaptive physical layer and video codec infrastructure is rather involved Initial results with usercontrolled DBRA events have been obtained A high data rate 4 Mbps physical link is first established and high quality low compression video stream is sent The high quality video frame grab is shown in Figure 11 The physical link bandwidth is then reduced to 64kbps Video data packets are now necessarily dropped resulting in very dramatic degradation in video quality Large portions of the image have been corrupted as shown in Figure 12 The video compression is then adjusted to match the physical layer throughput The resulting video stream is now less sharp but clearly superior to the previous case as can be seen in Figure 13 Adjusting the data rate at the application layer is therefore an important aspect of the DBRA system Without this link real-time applications cannot take advantage of conditions better than the worst case satellite link worst case terminal mobility and worst case traffic demand dynamics Taking advantage of the dynamic allocation of satellite resources requires coordination between all network layers including mechanisms for physical layer mode change link layer bandwidth allocation network layer QoS capabilities and application layer changes to data rate Figure 10 Video subsystem block diagram 6 6 CONCLUSION
