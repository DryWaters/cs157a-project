2 Zhouch@lreis.ac.cn Abstract Spatial Co-location patterns are similar to association rules but explore more relying spatial auto-correlation. They represent subsets of Boolean spatial features whose instances are often located in close geographic proximity. Existing co-location patterns mining researches only concern the spatial attributes and few of them can handle the huge amount of non-spatial attributes in spatial datasets. Also, they use distance threshold to define spatial neighborhood. Howeve r, it is hard to decide the distance threshold for each spatial dataset without specific prior knowledge. Moreover spatial datasets are not usually even distributed, so a unique distance va lue cannot fit an irregularly distributed spatial dataset well Here, we proposed a qualitative spatial co-location pattern, which contains both spatial and non 
spatial information. And the k nearest features k NF neighbourhood relation was define d to set the spatial relation between different kinds of spatial features The k NF set of one featureês instances was used to evaluate close relationship to the other features. To find qualitative co-location patterns in large spatial datasets, some formal definitions were given, and a QuCOM \(Qualitative spatial CO-location patterns Mining algorithm was proposed. Experimental results on the USA thesis map data prove that QuCOM algorithm is accurate and efficient and the patterns founded contain more interesting information Keywords  Include at least 5 keywords or phrases I I NTRODUCTION 
In spatial datasets, not only spatial attributes, but also nonspatial attributes play an impor tant role in describing specified spatial features. Howeve r, until now, it is still a challenge to handle non-spatial information in spatial data mining because there are so many different kinds of non-spatial attributes exist Spatial co-location patterns mining is an important spatial data mining task with broad applications. Examples include symbiotic species discovery co-located serv ices frequently requested together from mobile devices in location-based services. Traditional spatial co location patterns mining researches cannot deal with non-spatial attributes in spatial datasets, which lead to poor comp 
rehension of those mining results. Here, we will consider both non-spatial attributes and spatial attributes, to mining qua litative described spatial colocation patterns. Compared with traditional spatial colocation patterns, the qualitativ e spatial co-location patterns have better comprehension, and can get the frequent closeness relationship between different spatial features in more details For example, it is interesting to k now what kinds of schools are near hospitals, secondary school or post secondary school The various types of sch ools are qualitative description for this co-location pattern The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II discussed previous work 
on spatial co-location patterns mining. In Section III, we formalized our definition of qualitative spatial co-location pattern. Section IV presented two characters of the k nearest features based qualitative spatial co-location pattern. Section V is the QuCOM algorithm for mining this k ind of patterns. Experimental results were given in Section VI. Then section VII was the conclusion of this paper II R ELATED WORKS Extracting interesting and us eful patterns from spatial datasets is more difficult than extracting th e corresponding patterns from traditional num eric and categorical data due to 
the complexity of spatial data types, spatial relationships and spatial auto-correlation  Specially, in the spatial association rule mining proble m, transactions are often not explicit. The instances of spatial features are embedded in a continuous space and share a variety of spatial relationships e.g., neighbourhood, contain overlap According to the di fferent methods to d eal with transactions spatial association rule mining can be categorized into two classes: spatial predication based rule mining 2  a n d  spatial co-location pattern mining 4  Shekhar gave the definition of spatial co-location patterns 
they represent subsets of Boolean spatial features whose instances are often located in close geographic proximity However, this definition only considers a close geographic proximity between spatial features, and does not contain the non-spatial effect On the other hand, appro aches to discover co-location patterns in data mining area ca n be mainly categorized into four parts ___________________________________ 978-14244-83 51-8  1 1 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE  


1 The clustering-based map overlay approach  6 treats every spatial attribute as a map layer and considers spatial clusters \(regions\of point data in each layer as candidates for mining associations 2 reference feature based approach e num erates proximity neighbourhoods to çmaterializeé a set of transactions around instances of the reference spatial feature transactions are created around instances of one user-specified spatial feature. The association patterns are derived using the Apriori algorithm 3 data-partition approach  a ttempts to measure the frequency of a co-location pattern by grouping the spatial instances into di sjoint partitions 4 event centric model base d approach 4 d efin es a  participation index as the interestingness measure. The participation index of a pattern is defined as the minimal participation ratio of the objects of each feature in the pattern All above mentioned appro aches have shortcomings Clustering-based map overlay approach assumes instances of each spatial feature are clustered; while many spatial features can be completely spatially ran dom or declustered \(i.e negative spatial auto regression\ many scales. Other three approaches use a distance threshold to treat spatial close relationship. Spatial featur es which have a distance below the threshold are considered to be close relationship However, it is hard to decide the distance threshold for each spatial dataset without specific prior knowledge More over spatial datasets are not usually even distributed so a unique distance value cannot fit an irregularly distri buted spatial dataset well. Xiong  p ropose a new buffer based definition of neighborhoods to mine data sets with extended spatial objects, e.g. linestrings and polygons But its geometric computation is costly cannot fit for l arge spatial datasets To avoid those shortcomings of distance based approaches we choose the k nearest neighbourhood, which is widely used in data mining area, like classification, clustering. However different from those traditional k nearest neighbourhood based algorithms, the close relatio nships of spatial features here are between distinguished spatial features. In fact, spatial features k nearest features are those who are located in the nearest neighbourhood and have different types of spatial features K nearest features based neighbourhood uses relative distance to measure the close relation among spatial feature objects, which can remedy the disadvantage of distance threshold based spatial neighb ourhood, also can handle polygon features better. When a polygon feature is abstracted as a point for the calculations the distances to its neighbours are increased, but its k nearest neighbours do es not change III P ROBLEM FORMULATIONS In order to deal with non-spatial attributes in our mining task, we proposed a qualitative spatial co-location pattern Non-spatial attributes in spatial datasets can be simply divided into two parts: classified attribu tes and numeric attributes Here, we only consider classified attributes. Besides, some numeric attributes can be preprocessed into classified attributes through discrete operations Generally to say, the qualitative spatial co-location patterns mining are based on the result of traditional spatial co-location patterns, to find the non-spatial frequent itemsets. A formal definition is below Definition 1 Qualitative spatial co-location pattern Given 1\A spatial feature type set T with M spatial feature types T = {C a C b  C M  2\ature object set O with N spatial feature objects, O = {o 0 o 1 o N-1 each o i  O is a vector<objectId featureType, location nonSpatialAttribute1 nonSpatialAttribute2, É>, where objectId 0, n-1 featureType T, location spatial framework S, and nonSpatialAttributes are qualitative description strings 3\spatial neighbourhood relation R over locations in S 4\A minimum spatial attributesê support threshold  s and a minimum non-spatial attributesê support threshold  non-s The problem of findi ng qualitative spatial co-location patterns is to find correct and co mplete set of co-location rules with spatial attributesê support threshold  s and non-spatial attributesê support value  non-s The output form of qualitative spatial co-location patterns could be multiple tuples. A double tuples qu alitative spatial co-location pattern can be described like: Co-location k C p nonSpatialAttributeP 1  C q nonSpatialAttributeQ 1 eans feature type C q with its non-spatial attrib ute value equals to Q 1 has a frequently nearest relationship with feature type C p whose non-spatial attribute value equals to P 1  The instantiation of spatial neig hborhood relation R is the key point to this qualitative spatial co-location pattern. Here we choose the k nearest neighborhood Based on the formal defin ition of qualitative spatial colocation pattern, we used Euclidean distance to evaluate the distance between spatial feature objects \(p, q\noted as dist\(p, q\and gave the definition of k nearest feature objects set and frequent k nearest feature objects set. Finally, we introduced the quantized k nearest features based qualitative spatial co-location pattern Definition 2  K nearest feature objects set of a Feature object short for k NF\(o Let o be a feature object in dataset S, the k NF\(o subset of the nearest k features objects of o, and any object in K NF\(o\he same feature type with o is omitted.

Fig 1 A sample spatial dataset Example 1 Figure 1 shows the frequent co-occurrences of some spatial feature types of points. In this spatial dataset S four spatial feature types named by lexicographic order \(A, B C, D\different shapes. Feature objects are located in a two dimensional space, and as can be seen instances of spatial features in sets {A, B} and {A, C} tend to be located together. Dataset S will be used as the explaining example in the fo llowing paper. We have 18 instances in S where 5 instances of A, 5 instances of B, 6 instances of C and 2 instances of D Example 2 Consider 5 instances of A in Figure 1, use k 2 as the number of nearest neighbor threshold, then: 2NF\(A 1  3 B 3  2-NF\(A 2 B 4 D 1 2-NF\(A 3  6 C 1 2NF\(A 4  5 B 3 2-NF\(A 5 B 2 B 1  Definition 3 k nearest feature types set of a Feature type short for k NF\(T Let C be a feature type in T k NF\(C\ union of each Cês instance o i s k NF\(o i n abstracted to feature type level.

Also, we make comparisons with the distance based co-location patterns A The inclusion character Obviously, the qualitative spatial co-location pattern set is a subset of traditional k nearest features based co-location pattern set when chosen the same support threshold, which means there has an inclusive relation between these two kinds of pattern. If Qu-Co-location k C p a i  C q a j ists, then Colocation k C p  C q oo This character can be used to find qualitative spatial colocation patterns according to the traditional k nearest features based co-location patterns B The anti-symmetry character Distance based co-location pattern s are bidirectional and symmetrical, co-location\(A, B  co-location\(B, A However, the computation of these patterns is very effected by the instance number of A an d B, especially to those rare spatial features. Itês nearly impossi ble to get a distance based co-location pattern contains rare spatial features. Huang identify a weak monotonic property of the maximal participation ratio to mine patterns contain rare spatial feature We notice that the computation complexity well be increasing exponentially as the th reshold low down. It is equal to the Apriori algorithm without pruni ng step, when chosen 0 as the support threshold According to our definition 4 k nearest features based colocation patterns have already considered the fact that each feature type has different in stance number. Usually, colocation k A, B  co-location k B, A\We call it anti-symmetry character. This character can handle the rare spatial feature situation, example 6 shows that feature type D only has two instances, although Supp ort\(C, D\1/3 \(2-NF\(C 4 d 2NF\(C 5 tain Dês instance\t Co-location 2 D  C with Support\(D C\Specifically, if colocation k C a  C b d Co-location k C b  C a both exist, then co-location k C a  C b  Example 7 From the 7 results of exam ple 6, as both Colocation 2 A  B\nd Co-location 2 B  A\ are exist, we can get a bidirectional k nearest features based co-location pattern Co-location 2 A  B 2 A  C\Two co-location patternsê support values are 80% and 60 V T HE Q U C OM ALGORITHM To mining qualitative spatial co location patterns directly is costly. For a spatial dataset which contains seven spatial feature types, each feature type contains only one classified non-spatial attributes and each non-spatial attribute has four kinds of qualitative de scription, when set k equals to 5, the size of each feature objectês k NF set could be calculated as below 12345 77 77 7 4 4 4 4 4 3306 8 size C C C C C 015\015\015\015 This could be very in efficient for a large spatial datasets even when facing multiple non-spatial attributes situation As mentioned in section IV, we can use the results of traditional k nearest features based co-location patterns, to mining qualitative spatial co-location patterns from them. This can avoid many computations, the size of k-NF set is diminished sharply \(only those spatial feature types have colocation relations will be used to establish the k-NF set\and also the length of each candidate frequent itemset will be shorter than k. Following this idea, we developed our QuCOM Qualitative spatial CO-location pa tterns Mining A QuCOM algori thm description The QuCOM algorithm can be di vided into two parts K nearest features based co-location patterns generation Qualitative spatial co-location pa tterns generation. Actually the first part could be a ordinary k nearest features based spatial co-location patterns mining algorithm like KNFCOM just focus on the second part here The key point in gene ration qualitative spatial Co-location patterns is to calculate Qualitative support for each k nearest feature types which are generated in \(1\first and foremost introduced data st ructure is AttrSet, it is used to store all the candidate qualitative spatial co-location patterns and their suppo rt values.

In this paper, we proposed a new spatial association pattern: qu alitative spatial co-location pattern. To mining this pa ttern from spatial datasets, we gave several definitions, and pro posed the QuCOM algorithm Comparison analysis in th e experiments part gave a clear proof that the qualitative spatial co-location mining can get more interesting results than traditional ones The ability to handle lin er spatial features is still a challenge in the spatial association rules mining area, because the definition of its close relationship is more difficult than points and polygons. Also, the QuCOM algorithm only can handle point and polygon spatial features well. Extending it to handle all kinds of spatial features could be our ongoing work A CKNOWLEDGEMENT This study was funded by a grant \(Project Number 41001231\ Nationa l Natural Science Foundation of China, and the National High Technology Research and Development Program \("863"Program\na Project Number: 2011aa120304 R EFERENCES  S.

We assumed a horizontally partitioned dataset and a message passing communication model. We considered a single class as a consequence but the algorithm can be easily applied for rules with a pattern as the consequence We theoretically proofed a relation between locally large and globally large patterns that is used for local pruning at each site to reduce the searched candidates.  We derived a locally large threshold using a globally set minimum recall threshold Local pruning achieves a reduction in the number of searched candidates and this reduction has a proportional impact on the reduction of exchanged messages. The performance study has demonstrated that EDP-ORD generates a much smaller set of candidate sets and requires significantly smaller amount of messages when compared to a naÔve extension NDP-ORD This shows that EDP-ORD is a scalable distributed efficient and effective technique for ORD in large databases We implemented only local pruning, however we discussed an upper-bound pruning that can help in achieving further reduction. Future extensions include studying upper-bound and polling-site pruning [9  an d  ex t e n d in g th e a l g o r ith m in  ca s e o f  vertically partitioned data set.

ing work because the approach is free from any assumptions on the structure of the attribute and does not have to rely on statistical approximations We evaluate the approach using two synthetic data sets to establish the upper and lower bounds of the covered similarity space We nd that we can cover the whole similarity space and that we are only constrained by the random number generation To validate the method against this constraint we investigate the speciìc inîuence of the random number generation by using the method as a test of randomness Additionally operational systems usually exhibit large amounts of noise in their workload therefore we validate the method against noise as well Our ndings show that it is highly resistant to noise whereas other commonly employed methods yield to the law of large numbers or fail completely Additionally the method can consistently identify dissimilar behaviour as well even though it is not as good at that task which is only partially true for other commonly employed methods The second method uses association rule analysis to identify and quantify the relationship between descriptive attributes of the workload The novel idea of this approach is to eliminate the use of values and instead focus on the attributes themselves and therefore rank the relative usage of the attribute That way the most important building blocks of the workload can be compared directly The algorithm is described and then evaluated using synthetic data sets to establish the upper and lower bounds of the covered similarity space This time we nd that we are only constrained by the amount of learnt rules which follows from the used rule learning algorithm At least 16 rules need to be available to cover the whole similarity space when the apriori algorithm is used The method itself however does not require a speciìc rule learning algorithm We then present our compound measure that can address problematic workload characteristics We use the transfer function concept to weight speciìc events in the waveletmethod based on relative attribute dependencies Then we conduct an empirical study to evaluate all methods on operational workload from seven large-scale distributed systems Two important characteristics stand out First the time and frequency behaviour is surprisingly well-modelled with a wavelet method Second the association rule by itself is seemingly useless However the inclusion of descriptive attributes improves accuracy when determining similarity of workloads We show that the compound measure improves upon existing work by evaluating it against two important scheduling metrics mean waiting time and mean execution time The analysis of descriptive attributes for the similarity in addition to the analysis of the time-dependent attribute yields a compound similarity measure that can improve accuracy by 24.5 At the same time the standard deviation can be reduced by 10.4 We conìrm these results with an independent statistical hypothesis test a twosample Anderson-Darling statistic and show the advantage of the compound measure even at higher signiìcance levels of  0  125 with only 11 dierence Our results strongly reassure our initial expectations that the compound measure is a good choice for large-scale and data-intensive systems that have to deal with enormous amounts of events and previously unknown dependencies in their workload Furthermore even though we only used scientiìc workloads in our evaluations we did not observe any constraint that would limit the use to scientiìc workloads 7 FUTURE WORK As a result of this work we can continue to evolve our simulation eort for DQ2 We will use the similarity measure to evaluate the results of our future workload models to speciìcally address problems like data transfer cycles distributed le caching or popularity-based deletion However the measure can still be improved If it is suspected that dependencies change over time then the rate of change needs to be investigated Extending the association rule measure with time-evolving graphs may prove to be appropriate for such cases Additionally we only used the Haar wavelet as suggested by previous work We are interested in investigating the inîuence of dierent types of wavelets on the analysis of non-periodic burst behaviour An implementation of the similarity measure including already pre-processed versions of the used workloads from the evaluation can be downloaded from our website  8 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are grateful to the following teams for providing

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
