ability to take into account contextual information user preferences and requirements and real-time events to provide optimal solutions and automatic con\002guration for the end user In this paper we present a speci\002c functionality in the design and implementation of a declarative decision support component that exploits contextual information user preferences and requirements to automatically provide optimal con\002gurations of smart city applications The key property of user-centricity of our approach is achieved by enabling users to declaratively specify constraints and preferences on the solutions provided by the smart city application through the Decision Support component and automatically map these constraints and preferences to provide optimal responses targeting user needs We showcase the effectiveness and 003exibility of our solution in two real usecase scenarios a multimodal travel planner and a mobile parking application All the components and algorithms described in this paper have been de\002ned and implemented as part of the Smart City Framework CityPulse 1  I I NTRODUCTION Smart city applications require Internet of Things IoT discovery and matchmaking techniques dedicated to dynamicity handling Information taken into account during the matchmaking process originates from diverse data sources including data streams city services the user's social context situational awareness e.g user location preferences and application con\002gurations The exponential growth in the availability of information from numerous data sources raises several dif\002culties in implementing sustaining and optimizing operations and interactions among different city departments and services  There is a strong need for smart city applic ation tools which support easy development of smart applications The state-of-the-art for smart city frameworks has major focus on existing smart city platforms and the existing works are mainly in four key areas i data acquisition ii semantic interoperability iii real-time data analysis and event detection and iv smart city application development support Among the existing frameworks such as PLAY 1 www.ict-citypulse.eu iCore and ST AR-CITY 5 CityPulse 8 is the only framework supporting all four previously mentioned features In additional to data acquisition and semantic interoperability the CityPulse framework provides a complete set of domain independent real-time data analytics tools such as data federation data aggregation event detection quality analysis and decision support The application development is supported through a set of APIs provided by CityPulse In this paper we focus on the decision making process which is designed and implemented within CityPulse framework The Decision Support component in CityPusle supports the complex reasoning capabilities that are required in various smart city applications such as non-monotonic nondeterministic and recursive reasoning This component represents higher-level intelligence strongly connects to user application layer and acts as a 003exible interplay between user-centric factors and dynamic aspects of the changing environment within the city Factors such as user interests and reputation requirements are also considered in the decision support process The exploitation of such factors along with richer user pro\002les has a great potential for providing more personalised decision support and greatly improve user experience when interacting with smart city applications Although elicitation and usage of user pro\002les is optional motivated by their potential we included explicit aspects of user pro\002les in the decision support process which are automatically encoded and used to con\002gure the way the decision support process works These aspects include not only user location but also user preferences and constraints on the solutions provided as well as dynamic correlations between contextual activities and their dependencies with city events for a particular user in speci\002c application scenarios The ability to continuously characterize the correlation between city events and user activities is used to dynamically 002lter events that are relevant for a particular user at a speci\002c time so that Decision Support can be instructed to 002nd new solutions whenever needed This functionality has been speci\002ed and implemented in a component called Contextual Filtering  In the proposed characterisation e v ents user acti vities and 360 


Fig 1 Decision Support I/O their dependencies are modelled using Linked Data and open vocabularies in order to provide a lightweight interoperable and well-established foundation for decision support In this paper we focus on user-centricity and describe how user requirements in terms of preferences and constraints can be explicitly speci\002ed and mapped into a representation that is independent from the speci\002c application In the remainder of this paper we will present the design principles for our Decision Support component in Section II formalise our declarative speci\002cation of user requirements and their automatic representation as logical rules in Section III and the implementation of our scenarios in Section IV We then conclude with some 002nal remarks in Section V II U SER C ENTRIC D ECISION S UPPORT The Decision Support component is responsible for higherlevel intelligence which can utilize user contextual information background knowledge and real-time events to deduce intelligent conclusion in real-time This component is also capable of acquiring the analyzing additional information sources related to user contextual patterns users application usage behaviour and self-de\002ned preferences while using a smart city application to provide optimal con\002guration for smart city applications and enable these applications to generate reactive application logic within deployed smart city applications Figure 1 represents a general information 003ow and interactions of Decision Support with other external components As an initial step to start the information processing Decision Support receives following input i a reasoning request from the application interface which includes user related functional and non-functional parameters constraints and preferences ii background knowledge  which is domain dependent information available for reasoning and application logic strictly tied to the given scenario and iii external information sources  which is any relevant information collected through external components required for that speci\002c scenario After processing all related input information as mentioned above Decision Support generates a set of scenariodriven solutions which are guaranteed to be optimal and satisfying all requirement and preferences speci\002ed by the individual user In real world scenarios the reasoning module has to deal with issues related to incomplete and contradictory information diverse and un-realiable input data and most importantly user de\002ned constrained and preferences are not explicitly input by the end user In order to better support the provision of optimal decisions the reasoning module must have ability to expressively deduce information from the information collected through internal and external modules additional to the user de\002ned input We achieved this expressivity within Decision Support by opting to use a declarative non-monotonic logic reasoning approach based on Answer Set Programming ASP All input information of Decision Support is mapped into ASP-format rules Decision Support combines mapped rules with already existent domain-dependent rules to design an application logic for the provision of optimal solutions to the users Figure 2 depicts a system sequence diagram of Decision Support to showcase all interactions and processing steps involved in this component In what follows we brie\003y elaborate each and every information processing step of the Decision Support component 017 Request Handler receives a ReasoningRequest as an input from the application containing user preferences and requirements Whenever a new reasoning request is arrived a new instance of Decision Support is initiated This ReasoningRequest is interpreted as the InterpretedRequest and used to initiate the DS Manger  017 Request Re-writer automatically generates the logic rules required for the speci\002c reasoning request that is received from DS Manager the detailed process of automated mapping and rules generated is presented in Section III After receiving the rules from Request Rewriter the DS Manager asks CoreEngine to perform the reasoning by sending InterpretedRequest and Rules as parameters 017 CoreEngine is a component that executes the ASP solver in our current implementation we use Clingo4 as the ASP solver using the EmbASP framework 2 which is able to invoke the ASP solver and to collect Answer Sets as plain Java objects The ASP solver starts by collecting 226 ExternalInformation refers to additional information collected through external modules which can vary depending on the scenario For example in the Travel Planner scenario see Section IV the possible routes from starting point to ending point or the latest city events can be considered as ExternalInformation  Decision Support directly interacts with external modules within the ASP program using a technique called the 224external atoms\224 By using this technique the ASP reasoner is able to invoke the external modules interactively only on need basis and can also re-use derived answers for other reasoning tasks This feature offers a very powerful ability on-demand composition of reasoning tasks to provide solutions 226 BackgroundKnowledge is static information containing important facts and rules related to a particular domain and stored internally for reasoning tasks For example in the Parking Space scenario see Section IV the locations of the parking spaces are part of background knowledge 2 https://www.mat.unical.it/calimeri/projects/embasp 361 


Fig 2 Decision Support sequence diagram 017 The ASP Solver combines ExternalInformation  BackgroundKnowedgle  and Rules to compute the optimal answers in the form of AnswerSets satisfying users de\002ned constraints and preferences 017 EmbASP Framework processes AnswerSets and the optimal selected Answers as objects are sent to the CoreEngine and then back to the user application for visualization The actual deduction process for generating solutions to the decision support task required by the application is performed by combining background knowledge external information user preferences  constraints and scenario-dependent rules The fully declarative nature of the ASP framework used in the implementation of the Decision Support component capabilities makes it possible to combine these rules and knowledge facts in a straightforward way and enables full exploitation of the expressive power of ASP inference for constraint checking and preference-based deduction This very same declarative feature is likely to simplify the extension of Decision Support provided within the CityPulse framework and to reuse for other decision support tasks III U SER C ENTRIC D ECISION S UPPORT R EQUEST  S PECIFICATION AND M APPING Preference-driven and constraint-based reasoning provides a powerful mechanism where user-centricity is a key feature and enables to 002nd an optimal match between the needs preferences of citizens available data streams and city services This section describes the speci\002cation of a reasoning request We focus on user preferences  constraints and their automatic mapping into declarative deduction rules These rules are then used in the decision support process for solution optimization In what follows we will detail each element of the Reasoning Request and de\002ne the automatic mapping or translation into deduction rules used by the Decision Support component Such translation is de\002ned in a general way so that independently of the Functional Details de\002ned as strings and values an automatic declarative rule-based speci\002cation can be obtained which is seamlessly combined with the rules in the Decision Support module used by a speci\002c application As illustrated in Figure 3 the Reasoning Request consists of 017 Type  T  determines the reasoning task required by the application This is used directly by Decision Support to perform the correct task using the reasoning engine and needs to be identi\002ed among a set of available options at design time by the application developer Such options have been de\002ned for the implemented scenarios Customization and extension of available types will be possible via APIs 017 User Reference is an identi\002er of the user that made the request Such reference is meant to be a unique identi\002er related to user credentials that will be used in the 002nal integration activities in order to manage user logins and instances of the CityPulse framework in different cities 017 Functional Details represent the actual criteria for the reasoning task required by the user i.e constraints and preferences for solution optimization Functional Details includes Functional Parameters Functional Constraints and Functional Preferences We shall focus now on the speci\002cation of each of the aspects included in Functional Details and illustrate how they are automatically mapped and translated into logical deduction rules A Functional Parameters A Functional Parameter de\002nes a mandatory information for the Reasoning Request for instance the 224ending point\224 in a travel planner scenario A set of Functional Parameters  005  is composed by a 002nite set of cardinality n 005  of individual Functional Parameter  031 i  031 i 2 005 8 i 2 1 n 005   Each Functional Parameter  031 i  is composed of 017 Functional Parameter Name  N 031 i  017 Functional Parameter Value  V 031 i  i.e 031 i  h N 031 i  V 031 i i  The Functional Parameter Name  N 031 i  is a string taken from a 002xed set of strings  002 T;N 031 i  and the Functional Parameter Value  V 031 i  is speci\002c for each scenario The set of Functional Parameters  005  is translated as the concatenation of the translations of each Functional Parameter  031 i  that composes it Each Functional Parameter  031 i  h N 031 i  V 031 i i  is translated as parameter  N 031 i  V 031 i   The Functional Parameter Value can be a single value or a set of possible values When the Functional Parameter Value is a set e.g expressed as enumeration of possible values it is translated into several of the above facts one for each item in the set B Functional Constraints A Functional Constraint de\002nes a numerical restriction about a speci\002c aspect of the Reasoning Request This restriction is 224strict\224 and needs to be ful\002lled by each of the answers otherwise referred to as solutions offered to the user A set 362

bikes Tony will be presented with his ideal route and will be able to select each leg of the journey based on concurrent and projected aggregated conditions Recalculation of his chosen route\(s can happen if conditions or preferences change and the provided solution will adapt to any detour of own choice In order to provide optimal travel-planning solutions to Tony Decision Support allows him to provide his multidimensional requirements and preferences such as air quality traf\002c conditions ect The Reasoning Request for this scenario has the following main 002elds 017 Type indicating what

distance measures and allows enhanced information interpolation to increase reliability Furthermore an enhanced routing system enables multidimensional weighting on path e.g depending on distance duration pollution events or combined metrics Thereby it is possible to avoid certain areas or block partial routes for speci\002c applications 017 Data Federation which is responsible for processing the application request for IoT streams and automatically discover the most relevant data streams after catering for individual requirements and preferences for a particular user request It is also

The city is increasingly reducing the amount of parking spaces per unit e.g apartments and the dif\002culty of 002nding a parking space means Frank has to drive around for a long time looking for parking spots This is very time consuming for him and results in negative environmental impact pollution noise By using multiple input sources of information the application can provide Frank with a certain degree of probability of 002nding a parking spot in different locations thus reducing the driving time and related CO2 emissions By knowing the number of cars on the road at any time the application can help Frank avoiding congested hot spots by being rerouted towards different paths to even out the distribution Decision Support aims to provide optimal available parking slots nearby

by leveraging the expressivity and fully declarative nature of ASP To achieve this we de\002ne a representation method that allows a user to specify constraints and preferences and we propose an automatic mapping to convert user requests into logical rules In order to demonstrate the ef\002ciency in term of reusability and declarativity of this approach we showcase the implementation of the Decision Support component for two smart city applications the Travel Planner and the Parking Planner applications Our rule-based Decision Support component can be used in various application scenarios by i identifying values of the parameters to be constrained or optimized in the Reasoning Request ii describing the domain-speci\002c rules for the decision task or using existing reasoning modules available in the CityPulse Framework iii plugging in the proper External Modules to compute subtasks when needed for scalability As a result of our proposal we can achieve user-centricity in the Decision Support process in order to provide optimal solutions that better target user needs A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research has been partially supported by SFI under grant No SFI/12/RC/2289 and the
