INTRODUCTION We envision that wireless sensor networks for health care s ystems being composed of heterogeneous sensor nodes over multitude sensor devices will be pervasivel y distributed carried by people or deployed in home and daily public environments and dynamically

networked  These pervasive sensory devices collect data from real worlds process and store them and feed them to all kinds of applications which open new dimensions to communication technology  A patient or an older may usually be at home sometimes walk around in a public area or take a traffic tool Figure l depicts a typical application scenario of wireless sensor networks for pervasive health care systems which can be divided into four parts  indoor part in-vehicle part public part and body part  The indoor part is usually deployed at home or hospital  constituted by several sensor nodes and a gateway 
with rich power supply  The in-vehicle part is usually deployed in the traffic tools or in the ambulance  which is also constituted by several sensor nodes and gateway  The public part is usually deployed in public area  constituted by several sensor nodes only Body part which is a collection of sensors 267Works done in Data Commun ication JTH Jonkoping University  Sweden 978-1-4244-5160-9 09/$26 00 2512009 IEEE nodes worn on patient's or elder's body provides an integrated set of personalized vital physiological data collection with several body sensor nodes and a gateway  In WSN for pervasive health care systems the body 
sensor network must be linked with one of the three sensor networks  indoor in\255 vehicle  and public sensor networks  to constitute an entire system  When patients are at home the body area sensors will work as mobile parts of the indoor nodes  forming a home care networks Critical data and home environmental data will be collected and reported to the Care Center through proper gateways  When patients are in the traffic tools or the ambulance body area nodes and in-vehicle sensor nodes will constitute a special in-vehicle network for healthcare When patients are in public areas  the body area sensors will work 
as mobile part and joint the public area networks  Public area environmental data will be collected and reported to the Care Center via Body gateways  In addition to important data transmissions through the above methods  the large amount of data need be locally stored and sent according to queries from the service center Based on the above scenarios we should summarize several requirements of routing protocols for our WSN for health care applications 1 A scalable and flexible routing structure for body nodes to join indoor  in-vehicle and public nodes easily 2 A uniform 
query and report scheme to support gateway access equally and distributed data query 3 A robust scheme to support high data achieve rate with limited delay to fulfill medical requirements  4 Energy efficiency policy should be considered to prolong the lifetime of sensors  This requires a new communication scheme that can d ynamically fulfill these requirements and achieve efficient data transmission  Currentl y there are already a number routing schemes trying to resolve some flanks of this issue 2-4   But we eagerly hope to find an all-around scheme to fulfill all scenarios mentioned above

is organized as follows Section 2 reviews the related works Section 3 gives some preliminaries and defines some notations  Section 4 describes the virtual hypercube routing Section 5 shows the evaluation result And we close this paper with some conclusions in Section 6 II RELATED WORKS Currently there are a series of survey papers in routing protocols with different kinds of classification  10 Routing protocols are usually derived from Ad Hoc networks  e.g AODV  DSR DSDV etc they can achieve a high performance in normal data communication between nodes but lack of adaption with the high layer applications which may cost large waste of communication resources Few of routing schemes trying to resolve some flanks of data transmission issue in heterogeneous node WSNs e.g Directed and some successor modified from DD as well as some data aggregation protocols are to raise up the data achieving rate and energy efficiency in WSNs But the mapping between contexts to the interest is not clear and the flooding based route selection scheme is also not efficiency enough GHT 4 hoped to employ DHT and Location based routing to achieve distributed data storage in WSNs However  these approaches either employ overlay structure such as DHT or Hypercube  to achieve the service and context aware or seek the 3rd-party's assistant e.g localization technology in GHT or piggyback this accessorial information on the normal routing packets Most of them achieve the decision based on local information to minimize the communication cost which may increase complexity of the whole system Part of our inspiration in this paper is from VRR which proposed a novel scheme to implement P2P routing as well as DHT functionality directly on the link layer b-Dimensional Complete Hypercube b-DCH b-Dimensional Incomplete Hypercube b-DIH SN It is a graph Given a node Examples ofWSN based healthcare applications In this paper we defme a novel routing scheme named Virtual Hypercube Routing VHR in which all the nodes can be organized into a specific position of a Hypercube The routing selection and maintenance rules are defined based on a hypercube a node only forwards routing messages to the nodes which maintain the shortest hops to the destination on the hypercube Based on this structure the routing for all health care scenarios can be implemented efficiently  We evaluate the performance of VHR using simulation tools under a home health care scenario and a public area health care scenario  The results show that this scheme performs good scalability  high achieve rate low latency and low overhead for data communication in both static and dynamic scenarios We believe it is a good attempt to implement effective data transmission for WSNs Each sensor node SNu{q s b 1  SN u lh bit qth

status However in WSN for health care systems more query will be in the large scale WSN at the same time and it is easy to imagine that ring based structure can't achieve an efficient enough routing forwarding with at most one backup path In this paper we use hypercube instead of ring to organize sensor nodes  which can highlight good performance in 13  There has been some recent works on joint Hypercube with routing and related area Blue Cube is a hypercube establishment approach in Bluetooth networks  ECube proposes a scheme to achieve efficient data filter index and match by service awareness routing and publish/subscribe communication  focus on efficient multicast by using hypercube structure All these approaches employ hypercube as an overlay structure Hypercube is also a well\255 known over layer structure and has been widely used in context based search in the Internet community  Authors in propose a keyword search scheme with attributes using DHT-based structure in P2P overlay networks hypercube structure is used to store keys with correlation attributes in neighbor nodes of a hypercube  We believe that this overlay structure can also play a key role in organizing sensor nodes and driving the routing directly based on the lower layer e.g MAC layer However the complete hypercube structure in these papers calls for the fixed number of nodes to constitute a complete hypercube which does not fit for many practical applications of sensor networks   A Preliminaries Definition EEl b H\(SNu SN v

corresponding P_Nei in its forwarding set in each hop only Once a packet reaches the destination with the same structure and content as corresponding with identifier RR is generated by by the reverse

three rare but possible scenarios will cause packet delivery failures Some complementary principles should be added to cover these scenarios The first scenario is named tic-toe problem As shown in

employ a simple way to replace the hypercube node with a cluster only the cluster head can be assigned the hypercube identifier cluster members can communicate with gateway via internal address A global address of non-repetition can be assigned to a node in VHR Local data can be stored in the corresponding node with the known destination address based on some hash rules On the contrary care centers can also query the data under the same rules As the routing discovers process is based on the principle of time constrained this scheme can guarantee a route within the RDR In this paper we try to load all the communication cost on fixed the nodes the mobile node only in charge of issue new route path This can reduce the energy costs of the mobile nodes The logical based routing scheme can reduced the query load for query process which can also minimize the energy cost by joint overlay routing with network layer routing V CONCLUSION This paper focuses on the data transmission issues in wireless sensor networks for health care systems  This scenario is very complex  which requires a new scheme that can dynamically fulfill these requirements and achieve efficient data transmission It brings a big challenge to routing  access control  data transmission storage and processing  This paper presents a novel routing scheme named Virtual IV EVALUATION We compare the performance ofVRR  and VHR based on IEEE 802.15.4 We repeat each simulation 50 times The metrics which we are interested in here includes the correct achieve rate or named delivery rate achievability average delay and the number of overload messages per delivery under the static status and 10 node moving status In moving status the average mobility is 0-5m/s According to the result in figure 7 we know that both VHR and VRR can get a high achieve rate in small scale networks However as our scheme do not contain any failure detection and auto recovery scheme the final achieve rate is a little lower than VRR in large scale networks From figure 8 we know that the delay of VHR is shorter than VRR in large scale networks And we believe that the reason is that VHR can provide high search efficiency as an exponential based routing selection scheme than VRR In figure9 we can find that the overload is increasing with number of nodes But there is not a significant increase on the message per deliver in VHR compared with VRR VHR can achieve a short delay and similar overload with VRR as VHR is a hybrid routing protocols joint both proactive and reactive scheme We believe that the structure of the hypercube brings good connectivity in both logical structure and proactive routing tables which can decrease the costs message to other nodes to diffuse the information of the failure nodes immediately but just delete the information about the failed node locally That is because the identifier of the failure node existing in the routing table mainly plays a role as logical forwarder the true existence or not will not affect the routing performance of the other communication pairs The only scenario of is that should be reserved locally in Routing tables even this entry is disabled from will generate a from with destination e.g.=OxI121 an existed in P 7 is failure will delete all the information related with in Unlike other protocols in our scheme we need not to issue any issued a message to announce the failure of received a request to the destination node which is its former physical neighbor but failure currently from a remote node A will be sent back along the reverse path to the source And the information about contained by the nodes in the old path will be disabled by marking P_Hop as FF Figure6a illustrates this procedure as an example When the is received by any nodes the latest routing Path_ID of is necessary because if the former is not failure but move to a new position in the same network the confliction maybe caused by both the and An example is shown in Figure 6b if moves from to then according to a to to route back to The will achieve via the confliction will occur In our approach nodes only obey the operation of the message with the newest Packet ID We did not discuss the mobility scenario separately because the mobility is a process that fails on the view of some nodes and joins on the view of other nodes at the same time Although we have described the working principle of VHR in detail it is also necessary to discuss the issues of its applicability as mentioned in section In our scenario the maximum sensor nodes can be However in some occasions the address space end-point problem As shown in figure 5c a node receives a from its physical neighbor Then it finds that the In this scenario the will also be generated by and forwarded back to As soon as receiving this message will also consider it meet a tic-toe problem and try to break it by expanding its forwarding set as the first scenario Teardown Teardown

Four questions were used to operationalize this construct Organizational culture was measured in terms of four constructs: rational culture, developed culture hierarchy culture, and group culture. SPSS 12.0 was chosen to conduct ANOVA and regression analyses Factor analyses were also performed to create independent variables such as organizational culture knowledge type, the quality of information resource management, etc.[See Appendix 2  4. 2.

The nine independent variables are expected to relate dependent variables and predict them. The R2 of the regression model is 0.292 and the adjusted R2 is 0.245. To examine whether the regression model suffers from multicollinearity tolerance has been calculated. Tolerance is a method of detecting the severity of multicollinearity, where 0 stands for perfect collinearity and 1 indicates no collinearity. As seen in Table 4, there was no serious evidence of multicollinearity among the variables The Durbin Watson test of correlated error is designed to determine whether there is first order correlation in the error term. Since the DurbinWatson statistic of 1.856 is above the cut-off value there is no evidence of serial correlation in the model   Table 1.

Dependent Variable: Assimilation 2. Note: ** p&lt;0.01,  * p&lt;0.05  The results of the regression analysis indicates that organizational structure, organizational culture rational management are statistically significantly related with organizational assimilation of information technology. Especially, as to the impact of organizational culture, rational culture turns out to be positively related with assimilation. The nature of task, level of knowledge codification, hierarchical 


task, level of knowledge codification, hierarchical culture, group culture, and developed culture are not significant related with assimilation of information technology. Table 3 summarizes the results of hypotheses testing The F statistic is 6.309\(p&lt;0.01 the model fits the data. Among the independent variables, organizational centralization, rational culture, information resource management were statistically significant in predicting organization assimilation. ?Information resource management? has the largest impact on the dependent variable, t= 2.547\(p&lt;0.01 hypothesis 5 is supported by the results. The variable rational culture? has the second largest impact on the dependent variable with the result of t=2.537\(p&lt;0.01 supported by the regression results. The impact of organizational centralization? is significant at the 0.05 level. Thus, hypothesis 1 is supported. The coefficients of the other variables: ?the nature of task,? ?knowledge type,? ?developed culture hierarchical culture,? ?group culture? are not statistically significant at 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10 level Therefore, hypotheses 2, 4, 6 ,7 are not supported by the regression results   Table 3.

Discussion and Conclusions  This study examined factors influencing organization assimilation of information technology in the context of Korean local governments. Of particular interests was the influence of organizational culture and types of knowledge on assimilation. The result of this study can be summarized as follows First, centralization is negatively associated with assimilation of IT. It seems that structural perspective on organizational innovation has been upheld again by this study Second, rational organizational culture is positively associated with assimilation of IT. As Debabroto et al. \(2002 assimilation of IT could be regarded as a cumulative result of actions by individuals and units within the 


result of actions by individuals and units within the organization. These actions of assimilation, in turn are stimulated or discouraged by an organizational milieu of norms, values, and rules. To the extent that assimilation of IT lies in the arena of rational choice of individuals, organizations may be able to foster assimilation by providing appropriate incentives Third, the quality of information resource management is positively associated with organizational assimilation of IT. The capacity of IT department in providing end-user support and enduser participation in IT project planning continue to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6   be important in promoting the organizational assimilation of IT   6.

managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
