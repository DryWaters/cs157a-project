If more useful information could be displayed in the limited range of screen, the efficiency of debugging would be improved. We took full advantage of the characteristic of fisheye view that can display both “local detail” and “global context simultaneously, improved the previous implementation models and algorithms, and solved the problems of using fisheye view on DFVPL such as nest hierarchy the difference in nodes’ size is big and wires are complex. We comb ined the debugger w ith fisheye view and proved its practicability and feasibility by some contrastive experiments  Keywords Dataflow visual programming language debugger, fisheye view, information visualization program visualization  1  Introduction  Dataflow visual programming languages have many advantages such as simple structure, inherent parallel potential, easily understandable graphic representation T h eref ore th e y h a v e been  w i del y  used in virtual instrumentation, digital signal processing, parallel computing etc. In practical applications dozens or even hundreds of nodes often appear in the DFVPL programs. Thus it is difficult to display complete information in the limited visual range on computer screen. Particularly during the debugging process, the serious non-intuitive obstacle of human computer interaction makes programmers synthesize the relationship between nodes in programs and debugging information in their own minds, which greatly reduces the efficiency of debugging h e common solutions of this problem are rolled view enlarged view and the multi-view. But the effect is not satisfied To simulate the feature of fisheye, construct the fisheye lens and display the image which is observed through lens into fisheye view. A fisheye view might magnify nearby objects while shrink distant objects. It has the feature of simultaneous showing both “local detail” and “global context”. Based on the research by Furnas and other people [3-5 a ny  s c h o l a rs  h a v e  proposed a variety of ways to apply fisheye idea in wide fields [6u ch as dat a f l o w  v i su a l  programming environment, the large graphic visualization, PDA, three-dimensional reconstruction virtual touring, and image-based rendering and so on In this paper we first outline LabScene, the dataflow visual programming language, which is developed by us. Then we aim at the features of DFVPL and focus on the dataflow semantics, improve the implementation of models and algorithms and combine fisheye view with debugger. It makes both the information of current running node and the overall dataflow semantics display simultaneously in the limited screen range. Therefore, the efficiency of debugging is advanced  2  LabScene -- One of DFVPLs  LabScene is an experimental virtual instrument oriented DFVPL i k e L a bV IEW 1416].

 Figure 1. Instance of calculating prime number  Nodes are a set of node  Node is displayed by different icons. It contains a set of input terminal and a set of output terminal   Wires are a set of Wire  Wire is a set to represent data flow route Containers are a set of Container  Container can contain nodes or containers  Container is called as Parent of node if it contains node  Container also can be considered a special node  The instance of calculating prime number is shown in Figure 1. The While Container is displayed by the rectangular frame and has ability of controlling cycle Nodes are connected by wires The node on the border of container called border node If the outside nodes and the border nodes are connected, the container is connected with the outside nodes  3  Implementation Model of Fisheye View  First we introduce the correlative terms. The normal view of a DFVPL program is shown in figure 1 The coordinates of the normal view is called normal coordinates and the coordinates of the fisheye view is called fisheye coordinates Every node has different shape, size and some attachments like label Position  and size are the two properties of the node. The node concerned by users during debugging is called focus  API denotes the importance of every node VW denotes the worth of visualization of every node and is used to distinguish the nodes’ size. Nodes in the same layer have the same parent container  3.1  Framework of Model  The point P norm under the normal coordinates  transforming to the point P feye under the fisheye  coordinates is achieved by the improved method of Sark at is     1     y y y y x x x x foucs max max norm foucs max max norm feye P D D D G T  P D D D G T P  and    2  1 1    dx x d x G  In the formula 2 d is an adjustable constant. It is called distortion factor. In the formula 1 x norm D is the horizontal distance between the point to be transformed and the focus in the same layer under the normal coordinates  x max D is gotten according to the situation that which layer the transformed point in: if P norm is in the top layer, setting the largest rectangular area which could surround all nodes and wires as A max the x max D is the horizontal distance between the focus and the A max boundary under the normal coordinate s; if P norm is in a container, the x D max is the horizontal distance from the focus to the boundary of the container T is a transformation function which is responsible for transforming the calculated relative coordinates into the absolute coordinates to paint The node’s worth of visualization in the same layer is designed as    3      n API f n VW  and  is an adjustable constant to ensure VW not to be 0. The node’s size is designed as      4    e feye f n VW c s f n S    In formula 4 c e s are all the adjustable constants s is called zoom factor. Notice that the nodes’ size got from formula 4 couldn’t guarantee there are no overlaps among the nodes. It is guaranteed by the algorithm behind

3.2  Framework of Main Algorithms  The framework of main algorithms is shown in Figure 2, and we will mainly introduce the 5 steps in the middle  Figure 2. Framework of main algorithms  3.3  Implementation  3.3.1. Calculating API  API in ordinary fisheye view is a pre-set value which is assigned to each node at the beginning of algorithm. For outstanding the dataflow semantics, the improved method is dynamically calculated density of dataflow between the focus and the other nodes. The following algorithm is based on the truth that nodes with connection are closer than those without connection; nodes with direct connection are closer than those with indirect connection Algorithm of API is as follows 1  If the target node is the focus  API equals 1 2  Otherwise, traverse all the nodes connected with the input terminals of the node by starting from the input terminals of the focus If the target node can not be found, traverse all the input terminals of the traversed nodes. If the target node is found API equals 1 n 1\d number n is the traversed layers. If input terminals have no connected nodes, turn to step \(3 continue finding the target node 3  Do the same thing as step \(2\g the output terminals of the focus If the target node is found API  equals 1 n 1\ and number n is the traversed layers Otherwise, the two nodes have no dataflow relationship and API equals 0 According to the algorithm API is a real number between [0-1 d t h e recipr ocal of trav ers e d la y e rs  reflects the density relationship between the focus and the other nodes  3.3.2. Calculating Zoom Scale Nodes might be overlapped after zooming, which is not obvious when the original sizes of nodes are almost the same and the overlaps can be reduced by interactive parameters adjustment. But in DFVPL, containers which have control ability such as while container contain plenty of nodes, so their sizes are much different from ordinary nodes. In order that guarantee containers do not overlap with the other nodes and the normal zoom scale of nested nodes, we calculate the zoom scale of every node first and then modified these overlapped nodes from the top layer to the bottom layer The key of calculating zoom scale is VW because only VW of the same layer can be calculated with formula 3. So, algorithm is needed to reflect nested hierarchy, which is as follows 1  Start from the focus seek up its immediate parent containers recursively along the nested hierarchy and get the collection called List p  2  Search List p take the outmost parent container as the current calculating container and set it as CurrentContainer Traverse List p from outside to inside and go to step \(3 3  According to API of all nodes in the CurrentContainer and formula 3, calculate VW and modify it if those nodes only exist in containers. If the node is a child of one container of List p multiply VW  of the upper layer by the got VW gain the last VW If the node is not a child of one container of List p take its parent VW as its own  3.3.3. Calculating Position In DFVPL, the nested hierarchy makes it special to express the node's position, which is defined by the relative position between the node and its parent container. If we still use the previous method to calculate the node’s position in fisheye view, the nest hierarchy will be lost after it is transformed. Therefore, it is necessary to modify the function G according to the focus Details are as follows 1  Get the parameters needed in formula 1 according to the information of the layer where the focus lies in and figure out the position P p of the other nodes in the same layer. If the target node is a container all nodes in it will inherit its position. Then set the relative position of the node in the container as P s the zoom scale of this container as S p so the relative position of the node in fisheye coordinates is P p  P s S p Finally, use the function T to get the coordinates of the node for printing 2  Set the parent container of the focus as a new focus if the parent container is not the top container then go to step \(1\therwise stop  3.3.4. Limiting Zoom Scale The zoomed containers according to formula 4 often cover other nodes. Thus we propose an algorithm to limit zoom scale. This algorithm not only modifies the zoom scale of 
1026 


container but also affects the positions of nodes in it Therefore it is necessary to adjust the parameters together. Details are as follows 1  Call the top container to be calculated as CurrentContainer  2  Traverse the nodes in CurrentContainer If the zoom scale of CurrentContainer has been modified adjust the positions of these nodes using the new zoom scale. If the traversal node is a container, figure out the minimum distance of coordinates between the right bottom corner of the container and all the other nodes in the same layer, marked min x and min y  According to the minor and positive one of min x and min y and the original zoom scale of the container get a new zoom scale of the container. When the CurrentContainer s traversal is over, set a child container as the new CurrentContainer repeat step \(2 until the whole DFVPL’s traversal is completed This algorithm is mainly used for adjusting containers in DFVPL. In fact, ordinary nodes also might overlap each other after it is zoomed. Since its influence is not obvious, it will be neglected  in order to reduce calculation  3.3.5. Mapping Wires The algorithm of mapping wires is similar to calculate position. After it is zoomed the points which are connected close to the terminals of the node would not be connected with the terminals correctly because the size of the node is not obtained from the right bottom corner of the node by using formula 1. So, we need to correct the position of wrong point, and keep the segments horizontal or vertical Details are as follows 1  If the output terminal of the node is the first point of segment point  i gu re ou t th e recta n gle area of the transformed node, according to the relative position of the output terminal with the node, get a new position P n assign P n to point   2  If the segment formed by point  d point   are horizontal before transforming, assign the ordinate of P n the same with the new ordinate of point  o  the same thing along the point collection, till the segment formed by the two points is vertical. If point 0 and point  r e v e rt i cal bef o re t r an s f or m i ng do t h e  similar modification, till the segment is horizontal By analogy, we can correct the position from the last point of wire \(the input terminal of the node above  4  Integrating Debugger with Fisheye View  4.1  Integral Structure  The debugger and fisheye view can be integrated in MVC pattern, as shown in Figure 3. Fisheye view belongs to view layer, debugger belongs to control layer and DFVPL programs belong to model layer Taking nodes or containers as units, LabScene supports single-step debugging, animation debugging and breakpoint debugging. Debugger records the process of debugging as a series of events, which can be replayed after debugging. Interactive view can transmit the edit files to debugger in real time and is the chief debugging view. Fisheye view does well tracking the current debugging state. User can use both interactive view and fisheye view in the mean time to improve debugging efficiency   Figure 3. Structure of fisheye debugger  4.2  Practicality Discussion  LabScene starts up a thread in each debugging mode and draws rectangles four times during debugging in interactive view with a delay of 100ms each time, to get a zooming out animation effect. If the operation of fisheye view can be finished within less than 400ms, users will not feel the stagnancy that the fisheye view brings. For a desktop computer \(Pentium 4, CPU 1.80GH, RAM 1G\ith different amount of nodes, the time \(ms\ that the algorithm of fisheye view spent is shown in Table 1. It is found that the amount of nodes is linear with approximate time. When the amount is added to 352, consumption of time would be still less than 300ms. DFVPL is a structural design which is a program can be sealed to use as a function node. Actually, in one program, it is hardly to find thousands of nodes but hundreds of sealed nodes to accomplish functions. So the debugger su pported by fisheye view is practical The debugger has the characteristic of time delay which is suitable for displaying the fisheye view, if show fisheye view according to mouse click, it will cause confusion and efficiency problem because of the sharp movement of the mouse. That is why LabScene does not integrate interactive editor with fisheye view

The focus of the upper part is "+1" in the outer layer, and the focus of the lower part is "+1" in While circle The constants are d 2  0.2 s 2 c 1 e 1 It is easy to observe the nodes that have dataflow relationship with "+1", reducing the attention of programmers to the nodes which are not close related to "+1". For example, in the upper part of Figure 4 While circle is close to "+1", but it is minified. It is significant that this kind of view can be shown clearly to programmers about dataflow semantics, concerned details and whole information. It is proved through the experiment that the model and the algorithms we proposed are feasible      Figure 4. Calculating prime number in fisheye view   6  Related Work  The closest related work is the similar dataflow visual programming environment, KLIEG [2, 6T h e design of fisheye on it mainly show the effect of fisheye by reducing details of non-focus nodes and interfacing by dialog box. There are no corresponding solutions for the features of DFVPL such as nest hierarchy, the difference in nodes’ size is big and wires are complex. However, if these characteristics are ignored, it will cause problems like losing nest hierarchy, covering nodes each other and losing positions of wires Some famous DFVPLs such as LabVIEW [14Prograph [17 an d V EE [18  s u pport s o m e t ool s t o  directly display the execution of DFVPL programs. But they have no fisheye view to help displaying visual information

7  Conclusions and Future Work  This paper analyzes some problems when applying ordinary models and algorithms of fisheye view straightly in DFVPLs, such as loss of nested hierarchy overlap of nodes and dislocation of wires etc. Aiming at these problems we proposed a new model and corresponding algorithms. It is proved that combining debugger with the improved fisheye view is practical and feasible through experiments The constants in fisheye view model can be used to adjust displaying effect. At present, we only choose the suitable constants through experiments. In order to improve the adaptive capacity of fisheye view, the following work is studying the relationship between layouts of DFVPLs and constants  Acknowledgments  This research was supported by the Programs of Science and Technology Development Plan of Jilin Province and National Science and Technique Supporting Plan Major Programs of China during the 11th Five-Year Plan Period.

9 recognition for use in critical procedure execution for checkout of space suits  7  Virtual Cockpits Current spacecraft and aircraft have cockpits where all operator input and output is concentrated Visual input from real images viewed through windows is used to fly the vehicle with control inputs from sticks and hand-controllers directly affecting control surfaces Additional flight systems information or autopilot headings can be shown in heads-up displays \(HUD or head-mounted displays HMD allowing the pilot to see both the view outside the cockpit and the ancillary information presented without changing his head position Advances in fly-by-wire and other methods allow this direct connection to be bypassed in favor of computational methods that can provide significant advantages for control stability and robustness Indeed as in the case of the Supersonic Transport cockpit windows were a real problem and virtual methods of presenting external visual information to the pilot have been investigated In this approach cameras are used to present a virtual picture to the pilot either using HUD or HMD technology Widely disseminated HSI hardware can match similarly dispersed MAA software architectures altering the need for spacecraft cockpits where information from all the vehicle\325s systems converges and from which it is controlled HSI devices can be used at any location within the spacecraft connecting to the nearest computing node using the wireless network functioning well as roaming mobile devices enabling innovative methods of HSI interaction for future spacecraft. Crewed spacecraft, in fact, can more and more be designed in the manner of remotely controlled vehicles in which the cockpit function does not need to be physically localized in one place in the vehicle and may even not be located within the vehicle at all The only time that cockpit functions are required is during transit orbit insertion trajectory corrections and orbital insertion assuming that the surface landings will be made in smaller craft During this time the crew would don virtual reality VR headsets with microphones and earphones and take out flight controls hardware which might look like computer game controllers for the pilot and commander All of the rest of the status checks and burn equipment readiness checks can be made by voice and checking the virtual reality displays Images from outside the spacecraft would be presented to the crewmembers perhaps synchronized with the visual field providing the capability for viewing the outside environment in all directions Crew location and tracking of body position are needed for taking advantage of these developments Miniaturized low power sensors and effectors may be mounted on a variety of places on the crew themselves allowing precise tracking of their position body postures and biometric status i.e heart and metabolic rate These parameters may be wirelessly transmitted to the relevant spacecraft systems allowing more accurate tracking of crew location and supporting maintenance of physical and cognitive workload within acceptable margins Moreover since these smaller head or body-mounted displays can move around with the user they open the possibility of the virtual cockpit being totally mobile and accessible anywhere within the pressurized spacecraft volume Indeed if the wireless network is appropriately configured the cockpit could even be accessed from outside the vehicle during EVA HAL9000 watch out Augmented Reality For ordinary vehicle and mission operations the crew could use alternative displays and input methods not requiring VR headsets. For example, the spacecraft could be equipped with beam forming microphone arrays and 3D spatial audio speakers capable of monitoring spoken commands and providing directional audio output directly to the crewmember This will allow the intelligent agent system to communicate with any crewmember and receive voice commands from any place in the spacecraft including the crew quarters Mobile hand-held displays or projected displays could provide a similar capability for visual information Each crewmember would have an area of responsibility and would be presented the appropriate displays hand controllers and have the appropriate voice commands available The software would implement a flexible presentation interface coupled to the workflow of the present operation with crew being able to override the default presentation At any point in time the system would be capable of answering questions displaying diagrams and procedures and showing schedules and timelines 


10 Functions for operating spacecraft systems and monitoring the progress of the mission can be done by augmented reality displays and voice commands In augmented reality information systems help crewmembers perform their duties by presenting relevant procedures in the correct time sequence along with relevant technical information drawings and pictures In effect this type of assistant knows about the task being performed using correlations to mission procedures and documentation to present the appropriate information to the crewmember at the right time or upon request The augmented reality system will have at least the following capabilities 1  Controlling avionics and information displays 2  Reminding the crew of tasks to be performed 3  Alerting the crew to off nominal and emergency conditions in the spacecraft 4  Help running diagnostic tests and conducting recovery activities in the case of failures 5  Planning and scheduling crew work activities and communications 6  Navigation and mission progress reporting 7  Procedure execution assistance 8  Robot control and monitoring 9  Medical monitoring and diagnosis 10  Communication facilitation with Earth The spoken dialogue system will be the human interface to a series of intelligent agents which will help run the spacecraft both autonomously and under human control These intelligent agents are software processes running in the computational modules acting as high-level user interfaces to the control software. Because transit and habitat spacecraft will be more complicated than previous spacecraft they will have to be largely autonomous for a small crew to operate and monitor particularly for longduration missions Since speech is a very natural communication modality for humans it will be the best interface to the spacecraft systems particularly when augmented by haptic pointing and gesture input devices and HMDs Haptic devices such as miniature finger-mounted buzzers can also be introduced to provide positive tactile feedback for operation of virtual switches and knobs The key to coherent function is to virtually connect the HSI components to the software processes needing human input and monitoring In the case of complex spacecraft this usually encompasses multiple concurrent processes with separate virtual displays for output Training would be embedded in the system in the form of refresher videos for instruction Overlays of information during repair operations can help guide the crewmember and provide procedures Figure 5 Augmented Reality Concept Mockup 


11 directly through displays or audio output replacing paper methods Most procedures have been migrated to electronic displays for ISS already The picture in Figure 5 is a photo mockup showing flight engineer Vladimir N Dezhurov using a virtual reality HMD aboard the International Space Station Note the presence of copious amounts of paper procedures posted throughout the spacecraft and the large amount of wiring floating in the air waiting to ensnare hapless crewmembers Since radio communication with the ground will be subject to long delays about 40 minute light-speed round trip transit time all the information necessary for problem solving has to be on board the spacecraft Advanced search techniques will allow the crew to find the relevant documentation for any problem or sub-system in the spacecraft The crewmember will be able to request information using spoken commands and flexible dialogue The intelligent agent systems would be designed to try to diagnose problems and provide possible remedies because the spacecraft systems may be too complicated for crewmembers to understand in detail Of course there will always be unforeseen problems which will require human reasoning and diagnosis which can be improved by the proper presentation of relevant information Virtual User Interface Design The dramatic reorganization of crewed spacecraft made possible by the new computing and communication hardware and user-interface technologies requires appropriate design Specific analyses need to be conducted to validate the savings and document the effect on the panoply of new risks and issues raised by adoption of virtual interfaces based on body worn sensors and displays It is important to note that similar claims have been made about the underlying technology for decades first when such body referenced computer displays were conceived in the 1960\325s and later when the aerospace applications were more specifically detailed in the mid 1980\325s At those time the body position tracking systems visual displays systems interactive 3D computer rendering and kinematic and dynamic computer simulations were not even approaching performance levels that would be practical  8  These technical barriers have largely been broken and the principle remaining issues concern concepts of operations and system engineering 9  The virtualization of the user interface for cockpits and control centers raises a number of significant design issues because the very nature of such interfaces removes many of the sensory cues associated with conventional user-computer interaction like the sound and feel of fingers hitting a keyboard and the kinesthetic position cues associated with mouse use These ancillary cues are important for establishing control contexts and are very important to keep users aware of 322where\323 they are in their task or software operation Fortunately the same display techniques that interfere with crew awareness can be used to enhance it by introducing naturalistic sensory feedback for inputs to virtual controls For example a switch closure on a visually presented virtual control panel can be confirmed by an auditory click as well as a visual change in color If necessary miniaturized tactile displays built into clothing or gloves can also be used to add haptic feedback The disseminated user-interface design should be guided by some of the rules for such systems proposed by Don Norman 1 0  1  Be predictable 2  Keep things as simple as possible 3  Provide good conceptual models 4  Provide rich complex and natural signals 5  Make the output understandable provide reasons for actions 6  Provide continual awareness reassurance of intended operation without annoyance 7  Exploit natural mappings of user input to environmental effects mappings The first two rules incorporate a realization that unnecessary complexity in an interface is definitely a defect Therefore the system\325s expectation of user expertise needs to be indicated to the user to avoid affecting predictability The remaining admonitions all relate to providing good conceptual cognitive models for system navigation These support the predictability of the system since one of the features of a 322good\323 conceptual model is that it leads to accurate expectations of system behavior These accurate expectations are supported by the provision of rich complex, natural feedback recommendation four This kind of feedback supports the understandability of the interface recommendation five The last recommendation to use natural mapping refers to metaphorical relationships between patterns of user inputs and systems responses and other analogous relationships in the real world When we wish to modify something on our right we typically move our hands towards our right The guidelines outlined above must be made more concrete for specific designs but their consideration will generally improve virtual user interfaces 5. I NTELLIGENT A GENTS A complementary concept to mobile virtual HSI for spacecraft command and control is the use of 322intelligent agents\323 to act as avatars for human interaction actors for autonomous operations and as experts for knowledge management The large amount of computing provided by MAA aboard a spacecraft can be comparable to an Enterprise IT system On a long duration mission to the moon or Mars this capability may significantly improve the abilities of the limited crew complement to perform vehicle and mission operations activities and can lead the way to more autonomous, capable and reliable human spacecraft 


12 Figure 6 Spoken Dialogue Interaction Figure 6 Spoken Dialogue Interaction NASA Ames Research Center has developed prototypes for intelligent agents applied to mixed human-robotic teams and to planetary habitats  1 1  These software systems were supported by facile mobile information systems and simulations of planetary surface surveys were conducted in analog environments  1 2  The intelligent agents implemented in the Belief-Desire-Intent language Brahms responded to questions like 322Where am I?\323 322What is the current activity What is the voltage from the generator?\323 and other queries of information available in the distributed IT system The agents would also initiate commands to the robots 322Robot take a picture of me\323 322Robot go to location 1 GPS coordinates 311\323 etc Note how useful these types of human to agent interactions could be aboard a spacecraft and how they mimic natural interactions between people Figure 6 shows a picture of an astronaut performing payload operations using interactive spoken dialogue interaction with a human on Earth However aboard a future transit vehicle this may well be an intelligent agent particularly when light speed delays prevent real-time communication with Earth Intelligent agents will be in effect the extra crew members needed to run and maintain the spacecraft A crew of 3-5 persons may not be able to operate a complicated spacecraft without the support of virtual crew members capable of working 24/7 Many functions can be handled or augmented by these virtual assistants Spacecraft monitoring maintenance and repair operations are obvious candidates given the amount of work required on these tasks Activities requiring specialized knowledge could be facilitated such as medical treatment by giving the human crewmember help in executing procedures for diagnosis and treatment The following are brief summaries of selected agent functions proposed for particular activities Repair Agent Intelligent agents can monitor subsystems and follow trends in operating parameters which might signal impending problems and schedule maintenance before the system fails or loses significant function or performance The following subsystems will need to be monitored continuously 1 life support 2 navigation 3 propulsion 4 communication 5 consumables 6 power 7 radiation shielding and 8 structural integrity Most repairs have complicated diagnostic and replacement procedures to be followed along with needed diagrams and technical information The spoken dialogue system can read out the procedure steps one by one and provide the necessary diagrams and pictures All of this material needs to be on the spacecraft so that no interaction with the ground is necessary to proceed with the repair A set of intelligent repair agents can significantly reduce the time to diagnose and complete a repair while improving the quality of the repair Medical Agent The crew is a vital part of the spacecraft and their health is as important to the success of the mission as the health of the vehicle The health of the crew will be monitored continuously both during exercise and normal activities This monitoring will have to be unobtrusive because of the long duration of the mission and this requirement is nicely met using body-worn sensors Sensor-bearing vests or shirts have been suggested as ways of measuring heart rate body temperature EKG and arterial oxygen These could be integrated with the sensors used to monitor location and body position for virtual HSI These sensors provide information wirelessly to the spacecraft medical intelligent agent The agents would keep track of all of the crew physiological data and analyze it for signs of medical problems in each crew member before they became serious Often trends in medical data are very valuable for finding conditions that may become serious in the future During medical emergencies like injuries or breathing difficulties the medical agent would interact with the care giving crew member to assist in diagnosis and treatment Much work has been done in the past to develop diagnostic decision trees which allow the system and caregiver to make a rapid diagnosis Since the medical agent would already have many of the vital signs it could quickly eliminate diagnosis sub trees that do not match the measured symptoms The agent could also communicate with earthbased flight surgeons for consultation saving time during serious medical conditions Crew Personal Agent Each crew member would have an intelligent agent to keep track of schedules exercise entertainment and correspondence with the earth On the long trip to Mars it will be necessary to keep up a rigorous exercise program Since the whole crew will be dependent on a limited number of exercise machines it will be necessary to schedule these machines between the whole crew The agent system will dynamically allocate exercise times and update the schedule in case of breakdowns and other delays Scheduling and coordination can be optimized and the results of this optimization sent to the Crew Personal Agent for execution by guiding the crewmember through 


13 scheduled activities This same concept can be applied to any constrained resources Communication with the ground will be delayed for up to 40 minutes so a system which keeps track of crew questions and answers received from Mission Control will be very important When the answer to a question arrives 2 days after the initial query it will necessary to pair the query and answer automatically to save crew time and jog their memory These communications will be in speech and text/picture form and will have to be indexed and tracked 6. T ECHNOLOGY D EVELOPMENT Implementing the MAA and associated HSI concepts will require investments in improving computer technology both hardware and software Fortunately very little needs to be invented since most components have either commercial or developmental predecessors Significant development of radiation-hardened avionics computing nodes would be needed Power consumption would have to be dramatically reduced Intelligent sensor modules would need to be developed all minimizing installed cost Sensor modules would need to be very small incorporating multiple sensing elements processor and network interface The MAA relies on high-performance computing and networks which can function at many times the rate needed for control This large excess of performance is used for implementing the voting and coherency algorithms needed for effective coordination Fortunately modern semiconductor technology provides the means to implement all of these features In addition to further development of low-power radiation tolerant electronics significant advances in avionics packaging would be required For example such avionics modules could not be liquid or conduction cooled rather thermal control would have to be passive Given the fact that no wired interfaces penetrate from the exterior the use of completely sealed packages would be possible which can increase reliability and interchangeability Network technology has progressed significantly with the adoption of AFDX time-deterministic Ethernet for critical aerospace control applications  1 3  This is being used in the latest Airbus and Boeing passenger aircraft Timetriggered Ethernet is a similar alternative Each method relies on issuing packets on a timed basis with sufficient gaps in between packets to allow other time-critical packets to be interleaved which produces bounded latency  1 4  Wireless network technology has similarly progressed but to date wireless time-deterministic networks have not been developed. Mesh routing software would be needed Today several products are available that perform mesh routing at either the MAC Zigbee or TCP/IP level Tropos Mobile IP routing has been flown aboard satellites in flight tests The biggest hurdle for implementation and biggest risk is the development of the necessary system management algorithms and software architectures needed for massively redundant peer-to-peer avionics systems Although much of the critical control for MAA can be adapted from IMA the larger number of possible redundancy solutions means that better means of maintaining coherency and failover would be needed Model-based system management and diagnostics could be useful in this area The system is reconfigured according to multiple constraints synthesized from current system state Planning algorithms could be used to determine the optimal process for reconfiguring such complex redundant systems Power transmission using inductive coupling is simply a matter of producing the correct magnetic interfaces Semiconductor technology providing the high-frequency driving current is used in every switching power supply 320 not an issue for technology development However providing an alternative power source maybe more difficult in that radiative schemes for power transmission may be difficult to apply internal to a spacecraft for humans Tripleredundant power distribution schemes are possible where each module couples with more than one distribution circuit Again low power electronics enables battery backup devices to be small and lowers the performance needed from wireless power transmission methods There are a number of building block technologies needed for the virtual disseminated interfaces we are proposing The various sensory display devices that physically present the information to the users are a real challenge These are devices such as miniature flat panel displays and audio interfaces for head mounted systems Recent advances in head mounted display technology benefiting from new OLED displays and redundant optical tracking systems make possible development of virtual cockpits based on body and head mounted displays that can present cockpit virtual images laid out within a user\325s 4   steradian field of regard Such displays can replace the much heavier powerhungry flat panel displays of conventional control consoles with bright high-resolution full color lightweight displays that only draw on the order of a few watts Other types of sensors such as miniature medical sensors currently exist and can be adapted to this use Array microphones can focus upon the speech of a crew member in a given known location The corresponding audio output function can be implemented using surround sound techniques commonly used for home theater Haptic sensors for interpreting motion and gestures are now available, but the feedback elements are lagging. Other types of user input devices are emerging and may be useful The main challenge for HSI is not the device development but rather the information and sensor fusion required for providing a coherent yet dynamic and flexible user interface The interface and display-rendering software that translates all the vehicle sensor and state readings into human sensory information and then encodes human voice and action responses into commands the spacecraft can use 


14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
