4 October 2007 1 INTRODUCTION The ability to get real-time target imagery in the cockpit is invaluable to any pilot The 802.1 lb wireless data link is a 
potential low-cost commercial solution To get operationally useful ranges radio frequency antennas need to be amplified The Federal Communications Commission limits transmission to 4 Watts effective isotropic radiated power Taking all this into account students at the United States Air Force Test Pilot School modified two C-12C aircraft to determine the reception envelope and performance characteristics in an air-to-air environment Reference 1 is the full test report 2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The system consisted of a Haigh-FarrR aerial blade omnidirectional antenna

3 DATA LINK RECEPTION ENVELOPE The first objective was to determine the air-to-air data link reception envelope between the two C-12C aircraft while testing all three physical configurations of the data linkInfrastructure Bridge and Ad Hoc Although each data link configuration was different the flight test procedures in terms of pre-takeoff actions flight test techniques FTTs used and data collection techniques remained the same To define the data link reception envelope a set of FTTs were designed to both capture azimuth and elevation dependencies Several user options of the data link were available so the results attained are reported in an effectsbased fashion to clarify all the data link configuration considerations Procedures Data link management duties were assigned to operators in each aircraft based upon whether it was the control or the host aircraft The host aircraft was responsible for changing data rates changing amplifications maintaining the link and monitoring the GPS data collection The control aircraft was responsible for actively conducting data file transfers or signal-to-noise ratio SNR measurements in addition to the responsibilities listed for the host aircraft Due to the flight test workload requirements of the control aircraft two flight test engineers FTEs were scheduled when possible to fly on that aircraft test conductor and laptop operator A single FTE was scheduled to fly on the host aircraft For all flight tests the air-to-air data link was configured on the ground prior to takeoff The following actions were completed before taxi setting up the data link configuration establishing over-the-air connectivity between C-12s updating the laptop system clock with GPS time configuring WindowsR XP Performance Monitor to collect data rates and performance characteristics starting NetStumblerR and setting altimeters to the local setting Configuring the data link consisted of establishing physical connectivity to the amplifiers and setting the power level on the amplifiers either 1 or 5 W Over-the-air connectivity was verified through conducting a file transfer Each laptop was updated with GPS time to synchronize the aircraft GPS position files with the performance statistics log files The WindowsR XP Performance Monitor file was configured to collect all network interface characteristics data transfer rates and performance statistics The sample rate was set to 1 Hertz the fastest rate available NetStumblerR was configured from the control aircraft and was used to collect SNR data The software could only be used during Infrastructure configuration testing due to architecture physical configuration requirements The altimeters were set to local pressure to maintain a consistent test methodology Once all pre-flight actions were accomplished an interval takeoff was conducted A rejoin in extended trail was initiated following the takeoff Data transfers were conducted throughout the climb to monitor the link performance and facilitate an efficient entry to the first test maneuver All data transfers consisted of a data pull and a data push to maintain a steady overall data transfer rate All file transfers were initiated from the control aircrafta data pull was a file transfer from the host aircraft to the control aircraft while a data push was a file transfer from the control aircraft to the host aircraft The overall data rate was higher when both a data push and a data pull were conducted at the same time The full bandwidth available to the network was used ensured the data link was always data rate saturated The FTTs flown addressed one or more of the following areas defining the reception envelope in 30 degree increments of azimuth examining the effect of altitude separation gaining statistical significance without increasing the number of the runs examining antenna blanking events and/or examining high noise effects Visual depictions of the FTTs flown for this flight test are found in 1 All outbound FTTs commenced with maximum available data rate and terminated 10 seconds after link break All inbound FTTs started from a range greater than link break and required the laptop operator to initiate data transfers at the first indication of link availability Configuration Effects All three physical data link configurations available for test were evaluated first during ground tests prior to flight test Over 28 hours of ground tests suggested all three configurations would work under the conditions the data link would be exposed to during flight tests However only the Ad Hoc configuration was found robust free of hardware/software resets enough to continue flight testing The Infrastructure configuration was the first physical configuration tested and was used to examine the best test method data file transfers or SNR measurements for determining the distance to link break the point in which data file transfers could no longer be conducted While the best test method was able to be isolated from the flight test dedicated to Infrastructure configuration testing the configuration itself could not continue to be used due to the amount of time required to recover from the faults The SecNetl 1 card used in the laptop of the control aircraft had to be reset over five times in flight Each time this occurred the flight test maneuver had to be repeated because the data link was rendered totally inoperable during those events 3 


same card reset procedures was tested during the third flight test The was selected for the remainder of flight test efforts During the first three flight tests was selected rather than AUTO data rate The AUTO data rate mode or during any of the remaining four flight test sorties which performed Ad Hoc configuration testing Due to the reliability of the Ad Hoc configuration it or 30 dBm of transmitter power delivered to maneuver flown Thefull data rate The Bridge configuration was tested during the second flight test Similar faults were encountered while testing in this configuration and the were used on the reception range Two range values were the was discovered and is discussed in the data rate effects section Data Rate Effects The first three flights demonstrated was selectable between 1 W and 5 W Selectable amplifiers an increased data link reception range when an access point the data rates same cards range represents the range at which the data rate dropped below 90 percent of its highest value for at least five seconds The other range measured were determined for each were AUTO 11 Mbps 5.5 Mbps 2 Mbps and 1 Mbps the actual over-the-air data rates were much lower The actual data rates are identified in Table 2 The data rates were a function of the physical configuration Infrastructure Bridge same and limited by that device Knowing the over-the-air data rate gives the were encountered during the third flight test were limited by Federal Communications Commission FCC part 15.247 to 1 W on the reception range Some additional 1 W testing as during the Infrastructure and Bridge configurations No faults as range increased the data link reception envelope were executed to successfully recover the data link The card requiring the resets was in the host aircraft configured as the slave The Ad Hoc configuration a relationship between the range reception and the selected data rate as SNR deteriorated with increasing range While AUTO did reduce the data rate was smaller than when 1 Mbps was selected Further testing was done to quantify the impact data rate selection had was selected 12 10 a 8 ct 4 2 Network Configuration Ad Hoc Amplification 5W 1.58W EIRP Brackets represent 95 confidence 1 Mbps 11 Mbps Auto Selected Data Rate Figure 4 Reception Range Dependence on Data Rate Actual Data Rates While the data rates selected or Ad Hoc Since both Infrastructure and Bridge configurations used were used for the flight test so the effects of high noise environments outside the Edwards Restricted Airspace could be observed Transmit power for all 802.1 lb devices was limited to Edwards Restricted Airspace For this reason 1 W amplification was used outside the restricted airspace for high noise testing and 5 W amplification was used inside the restricted airspace to quantify the effects amplification had was conducted in the Edwards Restricted Airspace to provide a baseline reception range for comparison with the high noise test points Measured Range The factors available for testing were data link configuration data rate and power The decision to test at 11 Mbps and 1 Mbps was made to examine the extremes of the data link's utility The 11 Mbps data rate offered the greatest available data link utility in terms of throughput available for applications while the 1 Mbps data rate 4 3.3 N/A 4.4 AUTO user baseline information for developing future applications Table 2 Actual Data Rates 11 Mbps 3.3 3.3 4.4 5.5 Mbps 3.0 3.0 3.0 2 Mbps 1.4 1.4 1.4 1 Mbps 0.7 0.7 0.7 Power Effects Amplification a 1 Mbps data rate a significant difference between the AUTO and 11 Mbps however the range reception nearly doubled when 1 Mbps a 6 dB isotropic antenna effectively 36 dBm of effective isotropic radiated power Ref 1 Clearance to exceed the FCC criteria could be granted inside the Edwards Restricted Airspace by the Edwards AFB Spectrum Management Office however their jurisdiction was predicted to automatically reduce the data rate from 11 Mbps to 5.5 Mbps to 2 Mbps and then down to 1 Mbps was the link break range which is the range where the data link did not transfer any data for at least five seconds Figure 4 illustrates the 95 percent confidence interval CI for link break ranges achieved with 1 Mbps 11 Mbps and AUTO data rate selections There was not 


offered the longest range available to the data link The decision to conduct 1 W and 5 W testing was based on examining the impact of transmit power and high levels of RF noise on the data link reception range Given those decisions the Ad Hoc configuration was placed into the following testable configurations 11 Mbps/5 W 1 Mbps/5 W 11 Mbps/I W and 1 Mbps/I W An analysis was conducted on the four available configurations to develop an orthogonal test matrix of varying range and varying elevation maneuvers The analysis was focused on examining the azimuth and elevation dependence of the data link reception envelope A single run of each test point was planned however some maneuvers were conducted multiple times due to airspace availability and air traffic conflicts during maneuvers Overall the results of the entire set of maneuvers were statistically analyzed to determine the data link reception envelope and its dependence on azimuth and elevation A total of 28 test points were evaluated for the 5 W amplification test points From the analysis no azimuth or elevation dependencies yielded a statistical significance Although the raw test results appeared to have an azimuth dependence particularly during tail-to-tail maneuvers there were not enough test runs to yield a statistical significance of this phenomenon Free of azimuth and elevation dependencies the range results from each maneuver were combined and analyzed as an amalgam to determine the 95 percent CI of the reception envelope for the 11 Mbps and 1 Mbps data rates The 95 percent CI for 11 Mbps and 1 Mbps data rates under 1 W and 5 W amplification can be seen in Figure 5 The 11 Mbps data rate region to link break of the reception envelope was between 3.0 to 4.7 nm between the aircraft and the 1 Mbps data rate region to link break was between 6.2 to 11.3 nm In general the large intervals were primarily due to the instances in which the tail-to-tail test points yielded shorter ranges while many of the 60 degree varying range and varying elevation test points yielded longer ranges Flying more replicates could reduce the CIs and provide a realistic azimuth and elevation dependence of the data link reception envelope These dependencies are necessary to reveal the installed antenna effects but more importantly they provide the operator with the best and worst locations of the reception envelope The same analysis was conducted on the 18 flight test maneuvers used to collect and define the data link reception envelope under 1 W of amplification No azimuth or elevation dependencies were present in the analysis The 95 percent CIs for 1 Mbps and 11 Mbps data rates can be seen in Figure 5 The 11 Mbps data rate region to link break of the data link reception envelope was between 0.76 to 2.3 nm between the aircraft and the 1 Mbps data rate region to link break was between 2.4 to 4.6 nm 12 T 10 u 6 E 4 2 0 Network Configuration Ad Hoc Brackets represent 9500 confidence  5 Watt 1.58 Watt EIRP  1 Watt 0.32 Watt EIRP 1 Mbps 11 Mbps Selected Data Rate Figure 5 Data Link Reception Range Losses and Noise Effects One of the most important attributes of an operational tactical data link is range Good range performance relaxes the operational bounds a pilot must regularly consider to maintain connectivity The standard RF range equation was applicable to this test In this equation range was a function of amplification antenna gain cabling losses and free-space losses Based on test team operational experience the maximum ranges for maximum data rate and for basic link maintenance were smaller than that desired for an operational data link This was because of the system's low effective radiated power stemming from low amplification levels and high cable losses The amplification levels were limited by FCC regulations concerning 802.1 lb applications The tests were conducted with the maximum amplification levels allowed under those regulations Cabling losses were a function of cable type and cable length Cabling alone accounted for a 20-dB loss Amplified output power was fixed at either 1 W or 5 W selectable Approximately 16 dB of cabling losses were present between the transmitting amplifier and the receiving amplifier After the fixed receiving amplifier gain a further 4 dB of loss was present before connection to the computer In total this led to 20 dB of loss between the transmitting amplifier and the receiving computer This signal reduction reduced the data link range from what could have been possible for this test For future applications cabling losses of this magnitude will greatly reduce range and decrease operational utility An additional technique to minimize cable losses would be to put the amplifiers as near the antennas as possible The achievable data rate was a function of SNR The previous discussion was concerned with the power of the signal The noise level will also be important to future applications but will be difficult to predict and even harder to control Testing showed high sensitivity to noise especially when operating near the maximum range The 5 T i Ir T 


test team did not predict significant effects due to noise when operating at the test altitude of 20-25,000 feet mean sea level MSL because of the low power of home WiFi networks In actuality noise appeared to be a factor even at those altitudes due to other devices transmitting RF energy in the 2.4 2.5 GHz 802.1 lb frequency band While those devices could not be identified the Itronix Duo-Touch Tablet PCs carried in the test aircraft incorporated spectrum analysis tools which identified varying noise levels at altitude Unfortunately the spectrum analysis recording and playback functionality was limited so noise level was gathered by the FTE in the aircraft only by visually watching the noise level and annotating when more than 60 dBm of noise was encountered As a specific example higher noise was observed in the vicinity of China Lake/Ridgecrest on flight 5 which caused the data link to drop while within approximately 3 nm lateral spacing of the developed area Outside of that area of noise the data link quality was good and high data rate was achieved To further quantify the effects of noise several runs were made at low altitude 3,000-4,000 feet above ground level over the Lancaster/Palmdale urban area These test points were conducted in the Ad Hoc configuration with 1 W amplification and 1 Mbps and 11 Mbps data rate selected Using the constant relative position FTT the maximum range for data link operation was 2,000 feet for 1 Mbps and 1,000 feet for 11 Mbps On the same day with the same configuration similar test points were performed at an altitude of 20,000 feet MSL in the relatively uninhabited areas of the Edwards AFB controlled airspace The maximum range for data link operation was 3.5 nm 21,000 feet for 1 Mbps and 0.7 nm 4,200 feet for 11 Mbps This shows an order-of-magnitude difference between achieved data link range in high and low noise environments substantiating the expectation that noise level would have a large effect on data link performance Failure to predict and plan for expected maximum noise levels may result in inadequate link performance in high-noise environments 4 DATA LINK PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS The performance characteristics were assessed quantitatively and qualitatively Data link performance statistics were collected during all the test points directed at determining the air-to-air data link reception envelope Additionally specific test points were flown to gather data on performance related tasks The results of this testing revealed the efficiency and utility of the data link Procedures The laptops on the host and control aircraft were both configured to collect performance statistics using the WindowsR XP Performance Monitor software The parameters collected were from the network interface statistics output queue length packets outbound discarded packets outbound errors and packets received errors These primary statistics describe how efficiently the data link was performing during data transfer operations using transmission control protocol TCP or unit datagram protocol UDP Errors and discarded packets demonstrate reduced efficiency and the output queue length will increase as error rates build The difference between the two protocols is application based TCP is used when errors in raw data after packaged and received is not tolerable and UDP is used when errors in the raw data after packaged and received is tolerable TCP statistics were collected during still image text file and pre-recorded video file transfers UDP statistics were collected during webcam operations live streaming video transfers UDP reduces the data packaging requirements of outbound data because of the presence of human interpretation in the application The human factor allows for interpretation that is not present in strict data transmissions For instance the human ear can understand a mispronounced word based on the context the word was used in The same can be said about video quality The human eye can look past missing pixels and still glean the overall intended picture Another quantitative measure of performance was the time required to transfer operationally representative file types Actual time measurements were taken during a still image text file and pre-recorded video file transfer within the applicable region high data rate or low data rate of the data link reception envelope The qualitative performance of the data link was assessed using three live data transfers Live video was streamed using webcams Text chat was performed throughout the testing using MicrosoftR NetMeetingR GPS position of each aircraft was transmitted over the network to the other aircraft and displayed in real-time on FalconView Data Link Performance Results Overall the network interface statistics reflected high network efficiency for all data rates and ranges The output queue length packet outbound errors discarded packets received packet errors received UDP errors and transmission control protocol TCP errors consistently remained at zero demonstrating an efficient use of the available data rate during all transmissions All qualitative tasks were performed effectively free of software resets at all data rates and ranges where the network existed The statistics of performance file transfers made in the 1 Mbps and 11 Mbps reception ranges are listed in Table 3 6

 arctan   9 the longitude of the site at Cartesian coordinates \(x,y centered on the pole.  The equation uses the variable L1 for the longitude where the horizon mask crosses \226   L sin 0 0       212     212 002 else 0 1 1 1  xy 212 005  t 004   004 L  DTE L  002   t  005  002 212  Hp d R     7  Comparing these theoretical e quations with the computed illumination and DTE communications averages required using an adjusted lunar reference altitude at the poles.  The lunar reference geoid radius of 1738 km is not a good average value for the terrain at either pole.  The lunar south pole is part of the Aitken Basin, and the GSSR Digital Elevation Model elevations ha ve an average of -1880 m within 200 km of the south pole.  The lunar north pole region has an average elevation of -1673 m within 150 km of the north pole.  These averag es were subtracted from base site reference altitude to get the value of \221h\222 used in equation 2.  This effectively gaves the base sites a higher elevation relative to the local average elevation  For selected base sites, solar illumination and DTE communications averages were computed for tower heights from 2 m to 1500 m, and in some cases 3000 m.  Then these tower heights plus adjusted altitudes and base locations were used in equations 1 through 7 to get predicted values of the yearly average metrics.  The results are shown in figures 14 and 15.  Figure 14 shows black curves of equation 5 plotted parametrically with distance from the pole.  For the selected sites, the computed yearly average solar illumination is shown by squares, connected by a dashed line with the theoretical yearly average for the same location and tower heights The theoretical values are marked with X\222s.  South lunar Pole sites are in blue and the lunar north pole sites are in red.  The plots show reasonable agreement of computed values and theory, with the computed value never exceeding the theoretical.   Figure 15 shows black curves of equation 7 plotted parametrically with distance from the pole.  Th e value of L0 was set to zero for the parametric curves.  Fi gure 15 include computed and theoretical values of the yearly average DTE communications for the same sites as figure 14, using the same symbol and color conventions  At no site will a tower of 1500 m or less provide both 100 average yearly solar illumination and 100% average DTE communications.  Towers of 1500 m at sites NB and NC will raise the average yearly solar illumination to 100 But for the lunar south pole sites, like B1, towers of over 2500 m are required to rais e the average yearly solar illumination to 100%.  This is because the peaks Malapert 002 peaks  t\002 1  212  0 1 4 R      6  The yearly average Earth co mmunications, DTE, is then given by the equation        L L  L L Hm R  8  The obscuring effect of these p eaks is also shown in figure 5, where the peak Malapert t 006 002    L  2 cos 180 abs 180 sin 006 212 003 003  002 latitude These variables are   003  and Leibnitz 002 obscure the view of the sun from the lunar south pole.  Equation 8 gives the elevation, Hp, above a spherical surface needed to see the winter sun over a peak of elevation Hm at a distance, d from the pole.  Equation 8 provided values in Figures 4 and 14 for the Malapert 003 and Leibnitz 212 003 is at +10 degrees azimuth  Figure 15 shows the yearly average DTE communication varies more with distance fr om the pole toward the prime meridian that with tower height above the local terrain Towers up to 3000 m at the poles do not make significant improvements in the DTE co mmunications average.  The computed yearly average DT E communications for site NG exceed the predicted values fo r towers between 32 and 1500 meters tall.  This is because the view northward from site NG toward the Earth looks across the floor of Byrd Crater which averages about -2500 m elevation  Considerations for Photovoltaic Array Design  The lunar pole sites create some difficult challenges for designing a continuously operating photovoltaic power system.  A site with continuous solar illumination will see the Sun travel through 360 degrees of azimuth during 1 synodic month.  A photovoltaic power system would require several permanently mounted photovoltaic arrays pointed in several directions, or would have to continually track the Sun with a single array.  Sin ce a single array requires much less mass, the design of the solar tracking system is examined here  The requirement to continually track the Sun could be met by installing the photovoltaic array on a vertical axle oriented parallel to the lunar spin axis.  At the lunar south pole, this axle would rotate counterclockwise with the Sun to keep the array normal to the solar radiation.  This requires a foundation to support the axle cross beam structures to hold the array on the axle, and a drive system to turn the array.  This system also requires a solution to the \221cable wrap\222 problem, in order to continually track the Sun.  After 1 synodic month the array has turned through 360 degrees and needs to continue rotating in the same direction.  Power and control cables from the array need to go through multiple slip rings, or the array needs to rotate 360 degrees clockwise to unwrap the cables.  A slip ring design is further complicated by the requirement to tolerate the fine dust on    arccos 004  005  b t cos if 


  10 the lunar surface.  Using the \221cable unwrap\222 method means stopping power production for a short amount of time, once per synodic month  A heliostat design using a focusing mirror may provide a low-mass solution to the \221cable wrap\222 problem [Ref 10   Figure 16 shows a photovoltaic array installed horizontal to the local terrain.  A parabolic section mirror is installed above the array, angled at approximately 45 degrees to the local horizontal.  This mirror is suspended from the crossbar of a mast placed next to the array.  The mast could also be the structure for the Lunar Co mmunications Terminal \(LCT antennas.  The mirror is suspe nded from an axle that is oriented parallel to the lunar spin axis and rotates once per synodic month to continually reflect solar radiation onto the array.  The mirror can continue to track after 360 degrees revolution, since there are no cables attached to the moving part.  This heliostat \221periscope\222 design provides continuous solar tracking, but is partially shaded once per revolution when the Sun passes behind the support mast  Shaping the mirror into a para bolic arc concentrates solar power for a small increase in mass.  The tradeoffs should consider the relative mass-perunit area of the mirror and the photovoltaic panels, the reflectivity of the mirror material and the relative masses of an array-support axle versus a mirror heliostat axle plus mast  Additional flat \221periscope\222 mirrors mounted on the crossbar could be used to direct solar light to areas nearby.  This provides an efficient method of lighting work areas because it bypasses the inefficiencies of the photovoltaic system battery storage, and electric lighting.  If the photovoltaic power system is located on a crat er rim \(as in Figure 16\a flat \221periscope\222 mirror could provide continuous lighting to exploration crews in the perman ently shadowed areas within the crater.  Sufficiently large heliostat mirrors could redirect enough sunlight to run photovoltaic arrays at remote locations.  This would provide very efficient power transfer for operating within the permanently shaded areas  5  C ONCLUSIONS   Separating the lunar pole solar illumination problem into terrain horizon mask and solar motion computations simplified the production of illumination metrics.  Using a simplified model of average solar motion allowed quick comparisons between lunar south pole sites.  The results show that within 100 km of the lunar south pole, solar illumination is maximized at previously identified site locations.  These sites are small areas on the peaks of isolated mountains and crater rims.  No site provides 100 yearly average for both solar illumination and DTE communication.  Lunar north pole sites were also examined No site at either pole prov ides 100% yearly average for solar illumination unless a tower at least 1500 m is placed on one of the best lunar north pole sites  The best lunar south pole sites are on the rim of Shackleton crater, and the ridge west of Sh ackleton crater.  These 3 sites have yearly average of solar illumination between 93 and 97%.  The Sites have 100% solar power generation capability about 85 to 92% of the year.  For both of these metrics, Site B1 on the ridge West of Shackleton crater has the highest solar illumination values.  Site B1 has direct-toEarth visibility of the entire Earth disk about 51% of each month.  More detailed analysis of site B1 can use the terrain horizon masks presented here, coupled with more detailed true-of-date solar motion computations  Examination of the site solar illumination profiles at 40meter resolution shows the peaks of illumination are distributed over many points.  The locations with greater than 80% solar illumination are spread over 100s of meters This supports the conclusion that the Digital Elevation Model has adequate sampling to show the true terrain characteristics  The lunar north pole base sites NB and NC have yearly average solar illumination around 97%, and have 100 solar power generation capability about 88 to 92% of the time for the average year  The yearly average for 100% DTE communications at the best lunar north pole and south pole sites are all around 50%.  The yearly average DTE communications does not vary significantly with tower height, but does increase to 100% for sites about 100 km from the poles toward the lunar prime meridian 6  A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  The author expresses thanks to Martin A.
