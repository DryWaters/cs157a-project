Mining Ratio Rules Via Principal Sparse Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Chenyong Hu1,Benyu Zhang2,Shuicheng Yan3,Qiang Yang4,Jun Yan3,Zheng Chen2,Wei-Ying Ma2 1      3             Abstract Association rules are traditionally designed to capture statistical relationship among itemsets in a given database. To additionally capture the quantitative association knowledge, F.Korn et al recently proposed a 


paradigm named Ratio Rules [4] for quantifiable data mining. However, their approach is mainly based on Principle Component Analysis \(PCA cannot guarantee that the ratio coefficient is non-negative This may lead to serious problems in the rules application. In this paper, we propose a new method called Principal Sparse Non-Negative Matrix Factorization \(PSNMF itemsets in the form of Ratio Rules. In addition, we provide a support measurement to weigh the importance of each rule for the entire dataset 1. Introduction Association rules are one of the major representations in representing the knowledge discovered from large databases. The problem of association rule mining \(ARM in large transactional databases was introduced in [1, 3 Its basic idea is to discover important and interesting associations among the data items. The form of such association is as following 80 To find association rules, most prevalent approaches assume the transactions only carry Boolean information and ignore the valuable knowledge inherent in the quantities of the items. In fact, considering that the quantities of the items normally contain valuable information for us, it is necessary to provide a definition of quantitative association rules when the datasets contain quantitative attributes. Several efficient algorithms for mining quantitative association rules have been proposed in the past [2, 7]. A notable algorithm is the work [4 where they provided a stronger set of rules as Ratio Rules A rule under this framework is expressed in the following form   bread milk butter a b c a b c is arbitrary numerical values  This rule states that for each a amount spent on bread, a customer normally spends b amount on milk and c amount on butter Principal Component Analysis \(PCA discover the eigen-vectors of a dataset. Ratio Rules [4 can represent the quantitative associations between items as the principal eigen-vectors, where the values a, b and c in the example above correspond to the projections of the eigenvector. Because the element of eigen-vector can be either positive or negative, sometime the ratio coefficient of Ratio Rules may contain negative value, such as 1: -2 : -5Shoe Coat Hat 


Obviously, such rule loses the intuitive appeal of associations between items, because a customer’s spending should always be positive Our method amounts to a novel application of nonnegative matrix factorization \(NMF  cannot directly apply NMF for our purpose, because it is still difficult to explain that these latent components represent the latent association between items in a quantifiable dataset. We need to provide a bridge to bring NMF closer to association rules In this work, we propose a novel method called Principal Sparse Non-Negative Matrix Factorization PSNMF the non-negativity constraint in the standard NMF[5 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the problem and the intuition behind the Ratio Rules. Section 3 introduces our new algorithm \(PSNMF Section 4 presents the experimental results. Section 5 concludes the paper. The convergence of PSNMF learning procedure is provided in Appendix 2. Problem Definition The problem that we tackle is as follows. Given a N M  matrixV \(e.g., market basket databases ijv gives the amount spent by customers on the product The goal is to find all Ratio Rules of the form Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ICDM’04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE a b c Fig 1. A data matrix and latent associations discovered by PCA and PSNMF  The above form means that customers who buys the items will spend 1v , 2v … respectively on each itemset Fig1.\(a organized with N customers and M \( 2 Here we assume that the dataset is consisted with two clusters. Our goal is to capture the associations between items. We list two Ratio Rules discovered by PCA[4] in Fig.1 \(b 0.77 : 0.64bread butter Obviously, the negative association between items bread” and “butter it is obvious that the Ratio Rules deviate with the latent associations behind the distribution of these points In fact, from Fig 1.\(a associations are not mutually orthogonal, while the method by PCA imposes the orthogonality constraint on these ratio rules. Therefore, Ratio Rules based on PCA 


cannot truly reflect the latent associations among the items correctly. Compared to Fig.1 \(b c Ratio Rules captured by our proposed PSNMF Surprisingly, each rule could be treated as an association in the two clusters respectively 3. Principal Sparse Non-Negative Matrix Factorization \(PSNMF Given a M N  non-negative matrixV , denote a set of P M basis components by a M P  matrixW , where each transaction \(column vector linear combination of the basis components using the approximate factorization 1 where H is a P N  coefficients matrix 3.1 Non-negative Matrix Factorization\(NMF Because the entries of W and H calculated by PCA may contain negative values, NMF [5] is proposed as a procedure for matrix factorization which imposes nonnegative instead of orthogonal constraint, and NMF uses the I-divergence of V fromY , which is defined as   log 2 i j ij v D V Y v v y y  As the measurement of fitness for factorizing V into ijWH Y Y= , a NMF factorization is defined as  min 3 i D V WH s t W H w j The above optimization can be done by using multiplicative update rules [5 3.2 Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization SNMF Although NMF is successful in Matrix Factorization the NMF model does not impose the sparse constraints Therefore, it can hardly yield a factorization, which reveals local sparse features in the dataV . Related sparse coding is proposed in the work of [6] for matrix factorization Inspired by the original NMF and sparse coding, the aim of our work is to propose Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization \(SNMF negative constraint. Therefore, we put forward the following constrained divergence as objective function  1

To make the solution unique, we further require that the 1normal of the column vector in matrix W is one. In addition, matrix H needs to be adjusted accordingly 8 9 It is proved that the objective function is non-increasing under the above iterative updating rules, and the convergence of the iteration is guaranteed \(in Appendix 3.3 Principal SNMF When the dataset V is decomposed with W and H each column value of H represents the corresponding projection on the basis space W . As a whole, the sum of every row vector of H represents the importance of corresponding base. Therefore, we define a support measurement after normalizing every column of H 10 Definition. For every rule \(column vector define a support measurement  11 j ij support w h h Consequently, we can measure the importance of each rule for the entire dataset by their support values. The more value of support implies the more importance of such rule for the whole dataset In order to select the principal k rules as Ratio Rules firstly, we rank the whole rules in descending by the support value. And then, retain the first k principal rules as Ratio Rules because they are more important than others. About the selection of k value, a simple method is taken such as 1 1  min \(12  k ii Mk ii support w threshold support w       


From above \(12 according that the sum of k support values of rules cover threshold \(i.e.90 4.

Conclusion In this work, we proposed Principal Sparse NonNegative Matrix Factorization \(PSNMF sparse non-negative components in matrix factorization. It aims to learn latent components which are called Ratio Rules.

available, CPU utilization drops quickly due to the frequent swapping. Compared with them, MSPS and GSP process the customer sequences one by one, hence only a small memory space is needed to buffer the customer sequences being processed. MSPS can also handle the situation that LDBk or C DB k can not be totally loaded into memory by using the signatures as explained in Section 4. Therefore MSPS does not require the memory space as much as GSP SPADE and SPAM Many real-life customer market-basket databases have tens of thousands of items and millions of customers, so we evaluated the scalability of the mining algorithms in these two aspects. First, we started with a very small database D1K-C10-T5-S10-I2.5 and changed the number of items from 500 to 10,000. The user-speci?ed minsup was 0.5 To run MSPS on such a small database with only 1000 customers, we selected the whole database as the sample and keep the user-speci?ed minsup unchanged to mine it Since MSPS does not apply the sampling on such a small database, supersequence frequency based pruning is not performed in mining. Thus, in this case, SPADE and SPAM performed better than MSPS and GSP as long as their memory requirement is satis?ed As the number of items is increased, SPAM shows its scalability problem. Theoretically, the memory space required to store the whole database into bitmaps in SPAM is D ? C ? N/8 bytes. For the id-lists in SPADE, it is about D ?C ? T ? 4 bytes. But we found these values are usually far less from their peak memory space requirement during the mining, because the amount of intermediate data in both algorithms is quite huge Compared with SPAM, SPADE divides search space into small pieces so that only the id-lists being processed need to be loaded into memory. Another advantage of SPADE is that the id-lists become shorter and shorter with the progress in mining, whereas the length of the bitmaps does not change in SPAM. These two differences make SPADE much more space-ef?cient than SPAM Second, we investigated how they perform on C10-T5S10-I2.5-N10K when the user-speci?ed minsup is 0.18 We ?xed the number of items as 10,000 and increased the number of customers from 400,000 to 2,000,000. SPAM cannot perform the mining due to the memory problem For SPADE, we partitioned the test database into multiple chunks for better performance when its size was increased Otherwise, the counting of CDB2 for a large database could be extremely time-consuming. We made each chunk contain 400,000 customers so that it is only about 100 Mbytes which is one tenth of our main memory size. Figure 3 shows that the scalability of MSPS and GSP are quite linear. As the database size is increased, MSPS performs much better than the others When database is relatively small with only 400,000 customers, SPADE performed the best, about 20% faster than MSPS. But SPADE cannot maintain a reasonable scalability as the database becomes larger, and MSPS starts outperforming SPADE. When the database size is increased from 1600K customers to 2000K customers, there is a sharp performance drop in SPADE, such that it is even slower than GSP. In that case, MSPS is faster than SPADE by a factor of about 8. As discussed before, counting CDB2 is a performance bottleneck for SPADE, because the transformation of a large database from the vertical format to the horizontal format takes too much time. When the database is very large, the transformation also requires a large amount of memory and frequent swapping, hence the performance drops drastically. Partitioning the database can relieve this problem to some extent but does not solve it completely. In addition, for the database with a large number of items and customers, SPADE needs more time to intersect more and 


customers, SPADE needs more time to intersect more and longer id-lists Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence  ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 100 1000 10000 100000 400 800 1200 1600 2000 Number of Customers \('000s Ex ecu tion Ti me se c GSP SPADE MSPS Figure 3. Scalability: Number of Customers on C10-T5-S10-I2.5-N10K, minsup=0.18 Finally, we mined a large database D2000K-C10-T5S10-I2.5-N10K, which takes about 500 Mbytes, for various minsups. This database is partitioned into 5 chunks for SPADE, and the results are shown in Figure 4 Based on our tests, we found SPADE performs best for small size databases. For medium size databases, MSPS performs better for relatively big minsups while SPADE is faster for small minsups. When database is large SPADE  s performance drops drastically and MSPS outperforms SPADE very much. If the user-speci?ed minsup is big and there are very few long patterns, GSP may perform as well as, or even better than, others due to its simplicity and effective subsequence infrequency based pruning 100 1000 10000 100000 0.33 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.18 Minimum Support Ex ec uti on Ti me se c GSP SPADE MSPS Figure 4. Performance on a Large Database D2000K-C10-T5-S10-I2.5-N10K 6 Conclusions In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm MSPS for mining maximal frequent sequences using sampling. MSPS combined the subsequence infrequency based pruning and the supersequence frequency based pruning together to reduce the search space. In MSPS, a sampling technique is used to identify potential long frequent patterns early. When the user-speci?ed minsup is small, we proposed how to adjust it to a little bigger value for mining the sample to avoid many overestimates. This method makes the sampling technique more ef?cient in practice for sequence mining. Both the supersequence frequency based pruning and the customer sequence trimming used in MSPS improve the candidate counting process on the new pre?x tree structure developed. Our extensive experiments proved that MSPS is a practical and ef?cient algorithm. Its excellent scalability
