This article describes the information analyzer, object extractor and feature recognizer. As this study aims to extract objects, it should be possible to analyze the feature information of each morpheme in addition to simple parts-of-speech information. To be specific, the ìobject extractorî extracts the detailed feature information of each morpheme. The ìobject extractorî in this study is designed to extract the human name objects using name-related probability and statistics and also to search structured patterns including resident registration numbers, phone numbers and dates using regular expressions Such information as resident registration numbers, phone numbers, dates and emails can be represented by the following regular expressions. Here, whether a string corresponding to a certain item matches the regular expression pattern is checked before all necessary objects are searched and extracted. The regular expressions below can determine whether a text pattern as well as a word or phrase matches or not TABLE I  R EGULAR EXPRESSION PER ITEM  Item  Regular expressions  Email 0-9a-y _   0 9 a a    0 9 a y _   0 9 a y  a y 2 3 Resident registration number 0-9 6 1 4   09 6  Phone number 0-9 2  4  0 9  3  4  0 9  3  4   0 9    0 9  0  3 4 09 3  4  Date format: YYYY-MM-DD YYYY/MM/DD   0 9  3    0  1 9   1  012      0  1 9    12  0 9   3 0    Date format: 2004/11/22 05:32:56 0-9 4     0 9  2     0 9  2 0 9 1 2  09 1 2  0  1 2   The co-occurrence frequency indicates the extent to which two objects are related with each other, which is called the degree of relationship.î Based on the co-occurrence frequency information between ìobjectsî extracted by the object extractor, the relevance between ìobjectsî is analyzed. Here, to correct any unconditional measurement of simply frequent words as having a high relevance, PMI \(Point-wise Mutual Information\ is used in calculating the relevance. The higher the PMI, the higher the relevance. Likewise, the lower the PMI the lower the relevance. The PMI-based relevance points to just high or low relationships without indicating the good or bad nature of such relationships. To characterize the relevance in addition to determining the degree of relevance, the positivity or negativity of the sentences where objects co-occur is analyzed. Then, the positive and negative relationships between objects are matched IV  R ESULTS AND C ONCLUSION  To verify the ìobject-relationship derivation technique information collected from multiple SNS was organized in a certain pattern and saved in MongoDB. The data constituting the main table were collected for about a month. The total number of data collected was approximately 220,000 items The collected SNS data underwent the information analysis and the object extraction, where top 30 objects were extracted from the 220,000 keywords. As such, from the SNS information collected based on a total of 7 keywords, new objects were extracted. The inter-object relationships of the entire objects derived were quantified as below  Fig. 2  Inter-object relationships based on experiment results \(including positive and negative relationships The present article proposed an object-relationship derivation technique capable of determining the positivity and negativity beyond the conventional text mining, so as to find the relevance between information analyzed based on certain keywords. Also, this study designed a system fit for real-time large-capacity processing and maximized its efficiency and practicality to the extent that it is applicable to high valueadded services  Corresponding Author Dr. JongBae Kim Graduate School of Software SoongSil University Seoul, Korea E-mail: kjb123@ssu.ac.kr 000\003  R EFERENCES   1  Jin-ok Kim, Sun-suk Lee, Whan-seung Yong, "Automatic Opinion Sorting Technique for Korean Texts", The Korea Information Science Society Journal, Database 38.6, 2011 2  Chang-jun Yang, ìThe Window of Future, Big Data Telecommunications Technology Association, TTA Journal Vol.140 pp.6~23, 2012 3  Text Mining.î CSERIC, [Onlin A v a i la b l e http://www.cseric.or.kr/new_cseric/yungoostep/content.asp?idx=903&st artpage_view=900&startpage=900&page=1 4  Gartner,ëGartner Says Solving ëBig Dataí Challenge Involves More Than Just Managing Volumes of Dataí, 2011.6 5  Text Mining with Information Extraction University of Texas, Austin Onlin A v a i la b l e: h t t p  w w w  c s  u t e xa s  edu   m l/p ap er s  di s c ot exmelm-03.pdf  


IV P ROCESSING THE LIFELOGGING DATA  Among the data from various sensors and events, the most significantly used data in this visualization was the geological data from the GPS sensor and the app usage data. In order to get displayable information from the raw dump, we have preprocessed the accumulated da ta to pack the location information and the app usage information together A Extraction and aggregation of temporal information One of the most important analysis tasks is to know when a participant used what application for how long. But, such highlevel queries are not directly supported in the data-collection app. The data collection app onl y captures the \221screen-on\222 and 221screen-off\222 event, and the two events fire when the foreground application is switched to another app. In order to infer app usage information from these raw event data, we make the following assumptions and use them as the basis of the data extraction algorithm for visualization 1\he user starts to use the phone by pressing the screen toggle button. This fires the \221screen-on\222 event 2\If the user turns the screen off by pressing the toggle button again, this fires the \221screen-off\222 event 3\If the user uses the same app from the \221screen-on\222 event to the \221screen-off\222 event the app\222s usage duration is calculated as the time between the on and off events 4\If the user switches to a different app, the current app is regarded as finished and the usage duration of the app is calculated as the time between the start of the app use and the app-switch event Under ideal conditions, we could easily infer the app usage information based on the assumption, but many problems hindered the data extraction/aggregation process in the wild. In order for the process to run flawlessly, at least the following basic conditions should be satisfied: \(1\he device should be powered on 24/7, and \(2\ the data-collection app must accurately record all events. But in fact, the logs were not clean enough to apply the algorithm without additional procedures There were many unexpected fluctuations in the log entries For example, in cases such as tu rning off the phone by abruptly removing the battery does not fire the \221screen-off\222 event, which leads to a missing event for quitting the app. Without additional proper preprocessing, the app is incorrectly logged as being continuously used for a prolonged period, which could cause an erroneous visualization. In orde r to prevent such errors, if an app usage event is not followed by another events such as periodic location logging, we assume that an exception has occurred and set the current app\222s usage duration as the duration between the start time and the creation time of the last periodic log B Extraction and aggregation of spatial information We periodically collected the GPS signal and a vast heap of data was dumped into the database. The logging period of the GPS sensor was set to 2 minutes, but only around 400 logs were registered in a day. The GPS sensor sometimes failed to generate stable location informat ion. In some cases, the device was not turned on for logging the location data for some reason Since the GPS sensor is not reliable in the sub-meter scale and various obstacles could hinder precise measurements of the sensor, the output of the sensors may jitter and jiggle around a correct location even if the device is sitting still on a table. Due to these reasons, naively plotting the locations without REAL WORLD 2. Infrastructure 3. Open Platform 4. Applications 1.

preprocessing will scatter meaningless data points all over the screen and can lower the overall quality of visualization. In addition to these visual percep tion issues, performance issues may also arise since loading all the noisy location data requires additional CPU time and memory space In order to ameliorate these problems, we have adopted an aggregation technique to reduce the computational burden and to improve the legibility of the visualization. Our aggregation technique \(Fig. 3\s similar to the fixation filter used in gazetracking researches. The gaze-tr acking applications typically use two-pass filters to first clus ter the spatio-temporal gaze data by temporal order and to re-cluster the data by spatial proximity in the second pass. We only used a one-pass filter in order to keep the temporal data untouched, since we needed the data for the time-ordered animations in the visualization Our aggregation algorithm wo rks by accumulating all the nearby and locally scattered point s to a single aggregated point The algorithm takes the temporally ordered coordinates data as input list and iterates from beginning of the list. In this algorithm, an accumulated data reco rd consists of three fields a single representative center point, a list of apps used in that region and the total usage duration in the region. First, an empty accumulation bin is creat ed initially with an empty application list, zero total usage time and the center coordinates set as the first entry of the GPS log. If the distance between the current coordinates and the previous coordinates is less than 20 meters, the current app is pushed to the used app list of the bin and the duration of the app is added to the current total usage duration of the bin. If the distance is greater than 20 meters, the current accumulation bin is saved and pushed to the result list and the iteration continues with a new accumulation bin Around 400 coordinates entries are reduced to around 150 aggregated coordinates entries V V ISUALIZATION DESIGN  Our visualization design consists of three parts: information panel, timeline view and map view. The information panel on the left shows the current date, the information of the currently focused app, the list of apps used on the current day with the total use duration of the apps on the right, and a calendar control where users can select a date to see the detailed log data on the date. The three components are interactively coordinated to enable users to control di fferent aspects of their data exploration. Brushing and linking interaction is implemented on the elements in the app list of the information panel. When users hover over an element on the list, the corresponding items on the timeline view and the map view are highlighted When users click on another date from the calendar control, all views are cleared and the log da ta on the selected date are visualized The timeline view at the top shows a view of vertically stacked white blocks each of wh ich visually encodes an active use event of the phone. Each block of the timeline view is colored white when users used the phone at that time, and remains navy blue otherwise. Each block is 2px in height, and if users switches to a different app during a single usage period the bottom 1px of the block changes its color to navy blue in order to distinguish it with a consecutive use of a single app Brushing and linking interaction between timeline view and map view is also supported. The corresponding circles on the map views change their background color to red if the mouse cursor hovers on a white block in the timeline view The map view shows the user\222s app usage pattern as black semi-transparent circles with the radius representing the app usage duration in the area. The visualization starts by first zooming the map and moving its center to the proper position When the visualization starts, the circles appear with animation according to their temporal or der. Manipulations such as panning and zooming are possible. The circles keep its radius even if the zoom level is change d. The absolute radiuses of the circles are arbitrarily set and do not have much significance Rather, the relative size of a specific circle among the group of circles is important to depict the relative amount of phone usage in that region VI I MPLEMENTATION  The server part of the visualization program was built using the Ruby on Rails framework. It handles the database transactions and the preliminary preprocessing of the raw data Most heavy CPU-bound work was delegated to the client-side  a\efore clustering                                                                                                \(b\after clustering Fig. 3 Clustering GPS data. Before clustering the GPS data, it is diff icult to identify each circle si nce many circles overlap in a sm all area. After clustering the GPS data, the scattered circles are clustered and made into a few big circles 32 


since if the server takes care of all the sorting and clustering the server will consequently stall and it could harm the usability and user experience of the client visualization tool. In addition, Ruby, the language used for server-side development is not a very fast language and so it cannot handle these computationally heavy workloads The packed data from the web se rver is then transferred to the web client that then mixes the app usage data with its corresponding location data and creates a visualization from it Google Maps and d3.js was used extensively with CoffeeScript http://coffeescript.org/\ implement the overall infrastructure of the visualization VII D ISCUSSION   C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  We presented an interactiv e visualization tool for exploratory analysis of life-lo g data collected using a new scalable framework \(Smart R eality Testbed\ for collecting various types of logs in smartphones. Our visualization tool enables users to easily review a nd track their everyday life by interactively showing their smartphone usage patterns Depicting the aggregated usag e pattern on the map in the chronological order allowed users to make useful insights into the overall contexts and details of their daily activities. By carefully observing the usage patterns in the visualization users were able to review and recall their day-by-day activities and experiences. It wa s surprising to see that most people used their smartphones for more than three hours a day on average and we could always notice a part of day where the user used the smartphone ceaselessly for an hour or longer. Social networking apps such as Facebook and messaging apps such as KakaoTalk were used extensively regardless of the time situation, and the location In this work, we focused mainly on location and time in our visualization design, and there are many more collected data fields that have not been utilized. More interesting insights can be made if more data fields are taken into account in the visual analytics tool design. Moreover, machine-learning techniques can be applied to derive more sophisticated patterns in the sensor data. For example, the data from the accelerometer can be used to determine if the user is walking, running, or on some transportation means. We think that additional processing of the log data can result in much more interesting results, and plan to improve the analysis techniques and the visualization design in future studies A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea \(NRF\ funded by the Korea government \(MSIP\ \(No. 2011-0030813  R EFERENCES  1 Ru\264ben Gouveia and Evangelos Karapanos.

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
