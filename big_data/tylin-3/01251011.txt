in this paper a novel measurement called the associationtaxonomy similarity  and utilize this measurement to perform the clustering With this association-taxonomy similarity measurement we develop an ef\223cient clustering algorithm called algorithm AT standing for AssociationTaxonomy for item data Two validation indexes based on association and taxonomy properties are also devised to assess the quality of clustering for item data As validated by the real dataset it is shown by our experimental results that algorithm AT devised in this paper signi\223cantly outperforms the prior works in the clustering quality as measured by the validation indexes indicating the usefulness of 
association-taxonomy similarity in item data clustering 1 Introduction Data clustering is an important technique for exploratory data analysis Data clustering is an application dependent issue and certain applications may call for their own speci\223c requirements Different from those of the traditional data the features of market-basket data are known to be of high dimensionality and sparsity There are several clustering technologies which addressed the issue of clustering market-basket data 3 4][5  Explicitly the support of item 000l is de\223ned as the percentage of transactions which contain 000l  Note that in mining 
association rules a large item is basically an item with frequent occurrence in transactions Thus item 000l is called a large item if the support of item 000l is larger than the n minimum support threshold In market-basket data the taxonomy of items de\223nes the generalization relationships for the concepts in different abstraction levels

2 Preliminaries In market-basket data a database of transactions is denoted by 000G   000w 1  000w 2  000w 000y   where each transaction 000w 000k is Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


a set of items  000l 1  000l 2  000l 000z   In mining association rules 1 the mi nimum suppor t 000V\000x\000s is given to identify the large itemsets In addition the support of an itemset in database 000G is de\223ned as the number of transactions which contain this itemset in database 000G  An itemset is called a large itemset if its support is larger than or equal to the minimum support 000V\000x\000s  In this paper an association itemset is de\223ned as a large itemset that contains at least two items and is not contained by any other large itemset The set of association itemsets is denoted by 000O 000D   000L 1  000L 2  000L 000p   Items in the transactions can be generalized to multiple concept levels of the taxonomy and represented as a taxonomy tree In the taxonomy tree the leaf nodes are called the item nodes and the internal nodes are called the category nodes  In view of the features of item data the items are categorized into three kinds of items which are association items represented as 000L 000D  single large tems represented as 000L 000V  and rare items represented as 000L 000U  An association item is an item which appears in at least one association itemset A single large item is a large item but not an association item In essence a single large item can be viewed as a large 1item which is not contained by any large 2-itemset A rare item is not a large item i.e not frequently purchased Explicitly the rare item is an item whose support is smaller than the minimum support In this paper a clustering 000X  000?\000F 1  000F 2  000F 000n 000A is a partition of items into 000n clusters where 000F 000m is a cluster consisting of a set of items Note that purchasing relationships i.e association and taxonomy relationships are important for the shelf-space organization In this paper he objective of clustering item data is to cluster the items with high association relationships and high taxonomy relationships together In view of the features of item data we propose association index and taxonomy index which are de\223ned below to assess the qualities of the clustering results De\223nition 1  Association Index  The association index of the clustering 000X is de\223ned as 000D\000L  000X  X 000F 000s 0005 000X  X  000l 000  000l 000  0005 000F 000s 000D  000l 000  000l 000   1 2   000F 000s     000F 000s  000\003 1   000X  000 where 000D  000l 000 000>\000l 000  is the association value of item 000l 000 and item 000l 000  Explicitly 000D  000l 000 000>\000l 000 1 if 000l 000 and 000l 000 are in the same association itemset based on the minimum support 000V\000x\000s and 000D  000l 000  000l 000 0  otherwise De\223nition 2  Taxonomy Index  The taxonomy index of the clustering 000X is de\223ned as 000W\000L  000X  X 000F 000s 0005 000X  X  000l 000  000l 000  0005 000F 000s 000W  000l 000  000l 000  1 2   000F 000s     000F 000s  000\003 1   000X  000 where 000W  000l 000  000l 000  is the taxonomy value of item 000l 000 and item 000l 000  Explicitly 000W  000l 000  000l 000  if 000l 000 and 000l 000 are in the same category under the cluster level 000O\000h\000y 000F and 000W  000l 000  000l 000 0  otherwise In this paper the cluster level 000O\000h\000y 000F is de\223ned as the level where the number of categories is equal to the number of clusters 000n  3 Design of Algorithm AT Association Taxonomy In this paper we devise algorithm AT for clustering item data The similarity measurement of AT will be described in Section 3.1 Section 3.2 describes the procedure of AT 3.1 Similarity Measurement The similarity measurement employed by algorithm AT is called association-taxonomy similarity which consists of the association similarity and the taxonomy similarity As described before the set of association itemsets is denoted by 000O 000D   000L 1  000L 2  000L 000p   For each association itemset the association relationships of items can be represented as a complete graph 000L 000s   000Y 000s 000>\000H 000s   consisting of a set of vertices 000Y 000s and a set of edges 000H 000s  In each complete graph each vertex represents an item in the association itemset and each edge represents the association between two items In mining association rules an association rule 000l 000 000 000l 000 holds in transaction database 000G with con\223dence 000F\000r\000q  000l 000 000 000l 000  if 000F\000r\000q  000l 000 000 000l 000  of transactions in D that contain 000l 000 also contain 000l 000  In this paper we use co-con\223dence as the measurement of the association between two items Here the co-con\223dence between 000l 000 and 000l 000 is de\223ned as 000h  000l 000 000>\000l 000  1 2  000F\000r\000q  000l 000 000 000l 000  000F\000r\000q  000l 000 000 000l 000   1 2  000V\000x\000s  000l 000 000l 000  000V\000x\000s  000l 000   000V\000x\000s  000l 000 000l 000  000V\000x\000s  000l 000   000 where 000V\000x\000s  000l 000  is the support of item 000l 000  The co-con\223dence 000h  000l 000  000l 000  represents the association between item 000l 000 and item 000l 000  Each association itemset is viewed as a cluster of items i.e 000F 000s  000L 000s  For notational simplicity the union cluster of 000F 000s and 000F 000t is denoted as 000F 000s\000>\000t Thesetofoverlapped items in 000F 000s\000>\000t is denoted as 000F 000r 000s\000>\000t and the set of nonoverlapped items in 000F 000s\000>\000t is denoted as 000F 000q 000s\000>\000t  In addition 000H 000F 000s\000>\000t denotes the set of edges in 000F 000s\000>\000t  000H 000r\000r 000F 000s\000>\000t denotes the set of edges connecting the overlapped items in 000F 000s\000>\000t  000H 000r\000q 000F 000s\000>\000t denotes the set of edges connecting the overlapped items and non-overlapped items in 000F 000s\000>\000t and 000H 000q\000q 000F 000s\000>\000t denotes the set of Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on

edges connecting the non-overlapped items in 000F 000s\000>\000t Similarly the association similarity between overlapped items of 000F 000s and 000F 000t is de\223ned as 000D\000V 000r\000r  000F 000s  000F 000t  X 000l 000 0005 000F 000r 000s\000>\000t 000>\000l 000 0005 000F 000r 000s\000>\000t 000h  000l 000  000l 000    000H 000r\000r 000F 000s\000>\000t    000H 000q\000q 000F 000s\000>\000t  000 Moreover the association similarity between overlapped items and non-overlapped items of 000F 000s and 000F 000t is de\223ned as 000D\000V 000r\000q  000F 000s  000F 000t  X 000l 000 0005 000F

000s\000>\000t  is a normalization factor for considering the effect of the edges of non-overlapped items in decreasing the similarity between two clusters Explicitly the existence of non-overlapped items represents the dissimilarity between two clusters Thus an edge between the nonoverlapped items increases the association dissimilarity between two clusters De\223nition 3  Association Similarity  The association similarity between 000F 000s and 000F 000t is de\223ned as 000D\000V  000F 000s  000F 000t  000\016 000r\000r 000\006 000D\000V 000r\000r  000F 000s  000F 000t  000\016 000r\000q 000\006 000D\000V 000r\000q  000F 000s  000F 000t  000 where 000\016 000r\000r is the weight of the association similarity between overlapped items and 000\016 000r\000q is the weight of the association similarity between overlapped items and nonoverlapped items In view of the factor of the taxonomy similarity the similarity for different properties are thus conducted The taxonomy similarity of overlapped item 000l 000 to union cluster 000F 000s\000>\000t is de\223ned as 000W 000r  000l 000  000F 000s\000>\000t  000Q 000O\000h\000y X 000n 1  000F 000s\000>\000t  000l 000  000n   000n 000 where 000Q 000O\000h\000y is the number of levels in the taxonomy tree and 000F 000s\000>\000t  000l 000  000n  is the set of items which is in the same categorywithitem 000l 000 in level 000n in 000F 000s\000>\000t  Similarly the taxonomy similarity of overlapped items of 000F 000s and 000F 000t is de\223ned as 000W\000V 000r  000F 000s  000F 000t  X 000l 000 0005 000F 000r

overlapped with any item in 000F 000t  The taxonomy similarity of nonoverlapped item 000l 000 in cluster 000F 000s to cluster 000F 000t is de\223ned as 000W 000q  000l 000  000F 000t  000Q 000O\000h\000y X 000n 1  000F 000t  000l 000  000n   000n 000 where 000F 000t  000l 000  000n  is the set of items which is in the same category with item 000l 000 in level 000n in 000F 000t  As a result the taxonomy similarity of non-overlapped items of 000F 000s and 000F 000t is de\223ned as 000W\000V 000q  000F 000s  000F 000t  X 000l 000 0005 000F 000q 000s 000W 000q  000l 000  000F 000t  X

between 000F 000s and 000F 000t is de\223ned as 000W\000V  000F 000s  000F 000t  000\017 000r 000\006 000W\000V 000r  000F 000s  000F 000t  000\017 000q 000\006  000W\000V 000q  000F 000s  000F 000t  000\003 1 000Q 000O\000h\000y  000 where 000\017 000r is the weight of the taxonomy similarity of overlapped items and 000\017 000q is the weight of the taxonomy similarity of non-overlapped items If each item in 000F 000s and each item in 000F 000t only have the root node as the same category 000F 000s is totally dissimilar to 000F 000t according to the taxonomy tree and 000W\000V  000F 000s  000F 000t  should be zero Hence because there are no overlapped item between 000F 000s and 000F 000t  the constant 1 000Q 000O\000h\000y is subtracted in the non-overlapped part for normalization purpose De\223nition 5  Association-Taxonomy Similarity he association-taxonomy similarity between 000F 000s and 000F 000t is denoted as 000V\000L\000P  000F 000s  000F 000t  de\223ned as 000V\000L\000P  000F 000s  000F 000t  000 000D 000\006 000D\000V  000F 000s  000F 000t  000 000W 000\006 000W\000V  000F 000s  000F 000t  000 where 000 000D is the weight of the association similarity and 000 000W is the weight of the taxonomy similarity The determination of values of 000 000D and 000 000W is in fact applicationdependent 3.2 Procedure of Algorithm AT Algorithm AT is designed to consist of three phases the segmentation phase the association-taxonomy phase and the pure-taxonomy phase Note that the association items consist of the elements in association itemsets The overall procedure of algorithm AT is outlined as follows Procedure of Algorithm AT Association-Taxonomy 1 The Segmentation Phase Step 1 Identify the set of association itemsets the set of single large items and the set of rare items 2 The Association-Taxonomy Phase Step 2 For each pair in the set of the association itemsets calculate the corresponding association-taxonomy similarity Step 3 Merge the pair which has the largest associationtaxonomy similarity as a new cluster Step 4 Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 until the dendrogram is constructed 3 The Pure-Taxonomy Phase Proceedings of the Third IEEE

Step 5 Identify 000n clusters in the dendrogram Step 6 For each single large item allocate it to the cluster with the rgest taxonomy similarity Step 7 For each rare item allocate it to the cluster with the largest taxonomy similarity Step 8 Repeat Step 6 and Step 7 until no item is moved between clusters The advantageous features of algorithm AT are twofold The 223rst one is on employing the association-taxonomy similarity to ly improve the quality of clustering association items The second one is to allocate the single large items and rare items into clusters by g the taxonomy similarity As such these items can be ef\223ciently and effectively allocated into the clusters Note that the numbers of single large items and rare items are usually large as compared to the number of association itemsets If we take each single large item or each rare item as a cluster and put them into the procedure from Step 2 to Step 4 the execution time will be prohibitive In addition lack of large association similarity with other clusters these clusters with only one single large item or one rare item would never be merged until most of the association itemsets are merged These problems are avoided in algorithm AT 4 Experimental Studies To assess the ef\223ciency of AT we conducted experiments to compare AT with the k-modes algorithm and the ROCK algorithm 2 F o r t he lack of space we merely use the real market-basket data from a large bookstore company for performance study and the analytical comparison from synthetic data will be conducted in our future extesion In this real data set there are  000G   100 000N transactions  000L   58909 items and 000Q 000O\000h\000y  3 levels In addition the number of the taxonomy level n this real data set is 3 In the real data the items with the same category are usually purchased together Thus the association relationships and taxonomy relationships are related to each other Figure 2 shows the relative quality of clustering results of AT ROCK and k-modes in real data set where the database size  000G  varies from 20K to 100K When we vary  000G  from 20K to 100K in ROCK the numbers of clusters are respectively 576 524 468 413 and 519 With associationtaxonomy similarity measurement AT signi\223cantly outperforms other algorithms as validated by 000D\000L  000X  in Figure 2\(a and by 000W\000L  000X  in Figure 2\(b In this real data set because the items with high taxonomy relationships are usually purchased together while the items with low taxonomy relationships are not AT has higher taxonomy index than association index i.e 000D\000L  000X  000A\000D\000L  000X   5Conclusion In this paper with the association-taxonomy similarity measurement proposed we developed algorithm AT for item data Two validation indexes based on association and ciation Index b\ Taxonomy Index  0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 20K 40K K 80K 100K D  TI  U  AT ROCK k-modes 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 20K 0K 60K 80K 100K D  A I\(U  AT ROCK k-modes Figure 2 000D\000L  000X  and 000W\000L  000X  for algorithms when  000G  varies taxonomy features of items was also devised in this paper to assess the quality of clustering for item data As validated by real data it was shown by our experimental results that algorithm AT devised in this paper signi\223cantly outperforms the prior works in the clustering quality of item data Acknowledgement The authors are supported in part by the Ministry of Education Project No 89-E-FA06-2-4 and the National Science Council Project No NSC 91-2213-E-002-034 and NSC 91-2213-E-002-045 Taiwan Republic of China References 1 R  A gra w a l a n d R Srikant F ast Algo rithm s f or M i nin g Association Rules in Large Databases Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  pages 478\205499 September 1994  S  G uha R Rastog i and K  Shim  R OC K A R ob ust C luster ing Algorithm for Categorical Attributes Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Data Engineering  1999 3 Z  H u a n g  E xtensions to th e k M eans Algor ithm for C luster ing Large Data Sets with Categorical  Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery  2\(3\304 September 1998  K  W ang C  Xu an d B  Liu Clustering T r ansactions Usin g Large Items Proceedings of ACM CIKM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management  1999  C H Y u n  K.-T  C huang and M.-S Ch en Usin g Cate g o ry Based Adherence to Cluster Market-Basket Data Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ICDM 2002  Dec 2002 Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


Recent work in Knowledge Representation and Machine Learning investigates Galois connections and lattices based on languages of terms more complex than those used in concept lattices, so modifying the notion of intent of a concept [4, 2, 6, 3]. We have shown here that by restricting the notion of extent of a term with respect to a a priori partition of the instance set I , we also modifies the lattice of extents which is no longer P\(I family of Galois lattices. As mentioned above Iceberg \(or frequent  lois lattices in which all individuals belong to the same basic class. Besides, the implication rules related to AlphaGalois lattices simply correspond to inclusion of ?-extents and a canonical basis of such ? ? implication rules can be extracted from the Alpha-Galois lattices in the same way as from frequent concept lattices \(the intents of the nodes are usually denoted as closed frequent itemsets. Association rules are then built using closed frequent itemsets [7, 12 Note that ?? implication rules inherit from the Galois lattice structure interesting properties \(as transitivity when dealing with  approximate  rules About construction of Alpha Galois lattices, it should be interesting to adapt efficient algorithms aimed at the construction of concept lattices \(e.g. [5 particular set theory view of a priori partitioned data referred to as rough sets theory \([8 rough sets expresses some indiscernibility between individuals of the same basic class, the rough sets view results in some degree of membership of i to an extent e, even if the individual i does not belong to e. At the contrary in the Alpha Galois lattice view, membership of i to an extent e is a prerequisite for ?-membership. A fortunate consequence of the latter view is the opportunity to construct Galois lattices As a conclusion there is still much work to experiment and to investigate theoretical issues and practical use of Alpha Galois lattices and corresponding ?-implication rules However we do believe that they represent a flexible tool to investigate data and handle exceptions that are relative to a preliminary view of the data Acknowledgments Many thanks to Nathalie Pernelle for its valuable contribution to the work presented here, and to Philippe Dague for its patient reading of an earlier draft of this paper References 1] G.

may be interested in a particular rule, and to determine what interesting information or knowledge, not explicitly requested we could provide him, in addition to the proper answer Indeed. improving man-machine interaction by emulating a cooperative behavior has been proposed by some researchers through various techniques [23]. In [24], the author states requests .for datu can he clawified rotcgltlv into two kinds specific requests and gods. A .spec$c request e.stahli.rhes U rigid quul$cation, and is concerned only with data that mutchrs it precisely A goal, on the other hund, r9tahliske.s N furget yuufifkution and is concerned with datu which is close to the target". For Cuppens and Demolombe [25], "the basic idea is tiwt witen a person asks a question. he is not interested to know the answer+ju.st o increase his knowfedge, hit he hus the intention to realize some action. aizd the answer contains necesscity or z1s&amp; in&amp;wmcrtion to reulize riais action". In our context, when such additional knowledge is not supplied. this forces the user to retry a tedious rule exploration repeatedly until obtaining a satisfactory "matching In the prototype interface, c.f., Figure 3\(Up select items that can both appear in the preniise and/or the conclusion part. Once the minsup and minconf thresholds are fixed, the user can generate the desired rules. Both textual and graphical representation are provided. The user can fur ther filter specific rules from the generated ones. In the 3D histograms based visualization, c.f., Figure 3\(Down items are showed in red, whiie those of the conclusion are depicted in blue. The associated Confidence and support are represented by a scaled histogram For example, supposc that a user may bc interested in the rule RI. Then, when the user clicks on the label representing the R I  antecedent, the visualization interface provides in a displaying area all rules that are connected to RI. From the meta-rule MR1 depicted in Table IV, we can check that the following rules are connected to RI: R3 : e=+k \(conf.=l k+e \(conf.=O.X conf.=OA conf.=0.5 The aforementioned visualization prototype is currently un der implementation and we show in the following how its fea tures fulfill the Sclzneitlernzan's visual design guidelines [26 The author recommended the following tasks "Uven&amp;w ,firxt zoom und,fiLtec then detuils on demand". In fact, grasping a huge mount of rules can very often encourage user to pcrfomi a superficial exploration instead of a in-depth one. That's why, our visualization tool has to provide an overview of the derived association rules. which permits an overall knowledge direct access and interconnections within the knowledge space Once the user focused on a rule \(or a portion of rules smooth user-zooming capability should be performed. We try to implement to . f ish9v technique to perform such task, by keeping the context while zooming on the focused portion of knowledge. In addition to the complete description of the desired portion of rules \(i.e.. premise, conclusion and confidence the derivable rules that can be draw from such generic rule set We have also to mention the desired "reiute" task [26 highlighting useful relationships among knowledge. Therefore 231 FUZZ-IEEE 2004 Fig. 3 DOWN UP the system as described earlicr, thanks to its meta-rules base will display the set of connected rules V. CONCLUSION We presented in this paper an approach for providing a cooperative exploration of generic bases of association rules This additional knowiedge highlighting connected rules to a user-select rules permits an improvement of man-machine interaction. To do so. we constructed a set of fuzzy mcta-rules extracted from the discovered fuzzy closed itemsets

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
