Improving the Effectiveness of Model Based Recommender Systems for Highly Sparse and Noisy Web Usage Data Bhushan Shankar Suryavanshi Nematollaah Shiri, Sudhir P Mudur Dept of Computer Science and Software Engineering Concordia University Montreal Canada bs-suryashiri mudur cse concordia ca Abstract A number of approaches which use model-based collaborative filtering CF for scalability in building recommendation systems in web personalization have poor accuracy due to the fact that web usage data is ojien sparse 
and noisy Clustering mining association rules and sequence pattern discovely have been used to determine the access behavior model Making use of some of the characteristics of the modeling process can pro vide sign$cant improvements to recommendation egectiveness In an earlier work we introduced a fizzy hybrid CF technique which inherits the advantages of both memoly-based and model-based CF In this paper using relational fizzy subtractive clustering as the first level modeling and then mining association rules 
within individual clusters we propose a two level model-based technique which is scalable and is an enhancement over association rule based recommender systems Our results from comprehensive experiments using a large real life web usage data and pegormance comparisons with memoly-based and model-based approaches help substantiate this claim 1 Introduction Collaborative filtering CF 6 is a popular technique used in web personalization for building recommender systems which predicts the preferences of an active user also called the current user 
based on the preferences of past like-minded users This approach relies on the history which is a dataset recording all previous users\222 interests which could be inferred from their ratings of the items at a website products or web pages Rating might be explicit e.g through previous purchases customer satisfaction questionnaires etc or might be implicit through browsing activity on a website Breese et al 1998 2 identified two major classes of CF algorithms Memory-based algorithms operate over the entire user history dataset to make predictions. These 
algorithms employ a notion of distance to find a set of users known as neighbors which tend to agree with active user The preferences of neighbors are then combined to produce recommendations for the active user. Memory-based techniques are simple, provide high accuracy recommendations, and admit easy addition of new data However they are computationally expensive as the size of the user dataset increases Model-based algorithms on the other hand consider the user history dataset to estimate or learn a model offline which is then used for predictions Data mining techniques such as clustering, mining association 
rules and sequence pattern discovery have been used for this purpose 7 91 Usage data is often rather sparse and noisy Many web sites e.g university sites, have large number of pages which are accessed by users with very diverse interests Even a single user may browse with different interests at different times Moreover, navigation pages near to the root in the site hierarchy are visited more frequently than the lower level pages which are more important content wise Applying the aforementioned modeling techniques alone on such sparse web data though reduces the online processing cost often comes at the cost of reduced accuracy of recommendation results 
It is possible to make use of specific characteristics of the modeling process to provide significant improvements in recommendations For example the relational fuzzy subtractive clustering \(RFSC\we proposed earlier 13 yields a model in the form of fuzzy clusters with specific sessions as cluster centers or protomes and every session having some degree of memberships with each cluster Using these characteristics, we proposed 14 a fuzzy hybrid CF technique which is a hybrid of memory based and model-based CF approaches that inherits the advantages of both We showed that compared to the model-based clustering\approach 
our fuzzy hybrid CF is scalable while providing increased recommendation accuracy for sparse web usage data Unlike many existing clustering algorithms RFSC does not require any user specified control parameters and scales up to large datasets Besides RFSC is relatively more immune to noise and can deal better with noisy web usage data In this paper we propose a two level model-based technique which applies association rule mining technique within each RFSC cluster. As shown by the results of our experiments this technique yields Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE/WIC/ACM Internatio nal Conference on Web Intelligence \(WI\22205 0-7695-2415-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005 IEEE 


significant enhancement over association rule based recommender systems applied to the original user dataset as a whole. The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 provides an overview of the RFSC algorithm In section 3 we present related work and our two level model-based technique Section 4 presents the results of experiments on real web log data Concluding remarks are provided in Section 5 2 Relational Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering In this section we briefly describe the RFSC algorithm Interested readers are referred to 13 for a detailed description along with experimental results Relational data is presented as a matrix R where Rij is the dissimilarity between objects xi and x It also holds that R$0 Rij=R,i and Rii=O RFSC algorithm operates on such a relational matrix R starting by considering each object xi as a potential cluster center The potential of xi is calculated using the formula P;=g e-"R where a=4lJ j=1 in which Rij is the dissimilarity between objects xi and xj NU is the total number of objects to be clustered  and y is essentially the neighborhood-dissimilarity value calculated from R 13 The object with the highest potential PI is selected as the first cluster center. Next the potential of each object is reduced proportional to the degree of similarity with this previous cluster center Thus there is larger subtraction in potential of objects that are closer to this cluster center compared to those which are farther away After this subtractive step, the object \(xt with the next highest potential Pt is selected as the next candidate cluster center Now to decide if this candidate cluster center can be accepted as an actual cluster center or not we make use of two thresholds Z'accept ratio and 5 reject ratio\where 0 Z g  1, and 5  Z  If Pt  EP1 then xt is selected as the next cluster center and this is followed by the subtractive step described above If Pt  5 PI then xt is rejected and the clustering algorithm terminates If Pt lies between PI and PI gray region then we check if the object provides a good trade-off between having a sufficient potential and being sufficiently far from existing cluster centers If this is the case then the object is selected as the next cluster center After finding C cluster centers, we find the membership of every object x with each cluster ci as follows R,,j is the dissimilarity of the i cluster center x with the j session xj When x  x  we have that R  0 and the membership uij  1 R ug e  i  1..C  j  l..N 3 Two Level Model Based CF Technique Let U be the set of URLs in the session history database D and M=]UI Let SI  SN denote the user sessions in D Every user session is a M-tuple We have sij  1 if the i user accessed the j URL or else sij  0 Let sa be the active user session. Also let NA c U be all the URLs not yet accessed by the active user A collaborative filter is a function f that takes D as input and produces recommendation set from pages in NA lo saj=f\(sl 2  SN Vj ENA Our goal in this paper is to improve the accuracy of association rule based recommender systems while maintaining scalability An association rule l is a statement of the form X  Y where X and Y are sets \(of items or web pages in our context X+Y indicates that whenever a session s in D contains itemset X then s also contains itemset Y with some certainty called as conJidence of the rule In Sarwar et ul 2000 12 association rules are first discovered from D Then preferences of the active user are matched against the items in the antecedent w of each rule The items on the right hand side of the matching rules are sorted according to the confidence values and the top N ranked items are recommended. As web usage data is highly sparse there may be a large number of short rules due to which there is often no exact match between the preferences of the active user and antecedent of the rules To improve the performance of recommender systems  111 considers dimensionality reduction technique Fu et ul 2000 5 suggest an alternative by finding rules with best match The degree of intersection of rules with active session can be used as a weight to determine the recommendation set Mobasher et al 2001  used a sliding window w over the current active session The size of this window is iteratively decreased until an exact match with the antecedent of a rule is found For this, the maximum size of the window has to be chosen which is often chosen arbitrarily as there is no prior knowledge for this. Another problem with this technique is that it requires repeated search through the rules in case no match is found Also during the learning phase when association rules are extracted from the whole user dataset using a global minimum support, we may miss rare but important items content pages occumng deep in site hierarchy which may not occur frequently. In addition, during the online recommendation phase many rules may not even be relevant to the active user What is required is to search through only those rules that are relevant and meaningful to the active user and select the rules that best may not be exact match the preferences of the current use With this background, we now present the proposed two level model-based technique In the first level we use RFSC algorithm to cluster the user sessions Let W Z,,Z  ZC be the set of C prototypes  Next we Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE/WIC/ACM Internatio nal Conference on Web Intelligence \(WI\22205 0-7695-2415-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005 IEEE 


defuzzify the clusters by assigning the sessions to a cluster to which its membership is highest Defuzzification causes noise to be separated from the real structure in the data In the second level we find association rules within each cluster In this paper we restrict to generation of association rules with a single consequent For an active session s our algorithm first finds the nearest prototype, then matches the s with the antecedent of each rule in that cluster to find the match score for each rule. This is weighed with the confidence of each rule to obtain the recommendation score rec-score of the page which is the consequent of that rule Algorithmic details are as follows Algorithm recommend Input W set of prototypes Association rules for every cluster s active session Output topN recommended URLS Begin  STEP 1 findthe nearest prototype  Fori=ltoC Begin Calculate DI the dissimilarity between hand the i cluster prototype Z EndFor find prototype Z such that D,is minimum EndBegb Begin I STEP 2 find recommendation score for every association rule in cluster p  For i  1 to NumberOfRules in p match\(s rp  cosine s I rec-score\(s I match rp  confidence Ip EndFor EndBegin Begin  STEP 3 find the url populanty  Prune rules whose consequent is not in NA If multiple rules recommend the same consequent, choose the rule with highest recommendation score Sort rules according to their rec-score EndBegb Return top-N most popular URLs EndAlgorithm Further in step 1, instead of finding the nearest prototype we can find K-nearest prototypes, Steps 2 and 3 are then carried out for each cluster and at the end the recommended URLs from each cluster can be combined 4 Experimentations and Results Recommender system efficiency computation time and effectiveness are two measures that we use to evaluate and compare the performance Recall, precision and F1 have been widely used for measuring effectiveness 2 10,121 We present comparative charts using these metrics. We had access to logs from the web server of our department during the period of June 15 2004 to July 5 2004 Access logs are at a fine level of granularity. Data cleaning 3 71 activities were performed to remove entries for image files failed requests web crawlers and other such components Sessions were created by considering 45 minutes as the maximum elapsed time between two consecutive accesses from a single IP address Root 223I\224 was filtered out and short sessions of length 1 or 2 were removed We obtained 12,227 sessions and 10,153 distinct URLs The average length of a session was 8.54 pages. Sparsity level defined as 1  nonzero entries I total entries\was 0.9993 12 which indicates that the dataset is highly sparse We then divided randomly this dataset into 1 the training set with 10,000 sessions and 2 the test set with 2227 sessions Using RFSC and validity index formulated in I31 34 clusters were obtained We compare the predictive ability of five different approaches 1 memory-based k nearest neighbor\\(2 pure clustering RFSC based recommendation model 3 pure association rule based recommendation model, \(4 fuzzy hybrid CF technique  and 5 two level model-based technique We adopted the all-but-1 protocol 2 by which one page is randomly withheld hidden from every session in the test set and evaluated the ability of the above techniques to predict this hidden page Figure 1 shows the comparison of recommendation quality for different values of K-Nearest Prototype KNP For two level model-based technique 681 sessions do not get assigned to any clusters after dehzzification step. These sessions are essentially noise and are not considered further Association rules are then mined in each cluster We see that the recommendation quality for two level model-based technique has increased compared to that obtained by applying association rules directly to the entire dataset Quality hrther increases as more nearest prototypes are considered We provide examples of some rules which were found with a high confidence  95 in different clusters but were missed when rules were extracted from the dataset as a whole since most items in these rules are content pages occurring deep in the site hierarchy  db/db/index.html  research/research.html j~zhu/homepage/T4512~O/faq.html programs/grad/coues.html  progra1ns/~masters/comp65 11 8html events/conferen/conferences,html events/defenceses/defences.shtml  events/other.html ents/seminars/semiminars.shtml The first rule indicates that users who are interested in research at CSE department have shown interest in both CONCEPT and database research groups The second rule indicates that students who have taken database design course comp6511\have been regularly visiting the faq page maintained by the teaching assistant of that course The last rule indicates that students often keep themselves updated with different events within the department. From Figure 1, we can also observe that the recommendation quality of pure cluster based model is better than that of pure association rule based model As TOPN increases, the recall increases but the precision is reduced and the overall impact on F1 is a reduction Figure 2 Also we see that for higher values of TOPN all five techniques have almost the same quality In Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE/WIC/ACM Internatio nal Conference on Web Intelligence \(WI\22205 0-7695-2415-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005 IEEE 


Figure 3 we compare the efficiency in terms of online recommendation time The time taken by hybrid or two level model-based approach is the same as model-based but 30-40 times less than memory-based approach. Also for 1 NP, 2-NP 3-NP and 4-NP the time increases in that order but this small increase in recommendation time results in increased recommendation quality Improvements rn Hybrid Two Level Model-based n Clustering Based mAssociationRule Based  0.04 0.02 0 Figure 1 Recommendation effectiveness 0.25  2-4-NP Twoie Modei-based  SCI M odd-based Clustering Model-based Association Rules 0.2 I 20 25 TOW l5 5 Figure 2 Impact of TOPN on Effectiveness M ernory-based 15 Two Level Model-based n-M odd-based Clustering M ode-based Association Rules 5 0 0 1 2 3 4 K Nearest Prototype KNP Figure 3 Comparison of efficiency 5 Concluding Remarks Recommendation systems must be able to handle sparse and noisy data such as web site access log We compute the access behavior models using a relational fuzzy subtractive clustering RFSC technique we developed earlier Each cluster centre acts as a prototype In our fuzzy hybrid CF technique, we choose K nearest prototypes and then limit our k-nearest neighbor search to a smaller subset based on membership values In two level model-based technique we once again use the clusters by defuzzifying them and then computing association rules within each cluster Our experimental evaluation and comparison of different approaches clearly show that both these techniques produce better quality recommendations than Dure model-based techniques providing recommendations closer memory-based approach with much times than memory-based approach Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by Grants and Concordia University support References to the quality of lower computation NSERC Discovery Faculty Research l R Agrawal and R Srikant 223Algorithms for Mining Association Rules\224 In Proc VLDB 22294 Santiago, Sept 1994 2 J Breese D Heckerman, and C Kadie, \223Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering\224 In Proc UAI 1998 3 R Cooley B Mobasher and J Srivastava 223Data Preparation for Mining World Wide Web Browsing Patterns\224 J of Knowledge and Information Gstems 1\(1 1999 pp 1-27  R.J Hathaway J.C Bezdek and J.W Davenport 223On relational data version of c-means algorithm\224 Pattern Recognition Letters 17, 1996 pp 607-612 5 X Fu J Budzik and K Hammond, \223Mining Navigation History for Recommendation\224 In Proc Int Con on Intelligent User Inte?faca New Orleans, LA, Jan 2000 6 J Konstan B Miller D Maltz J Herlocker L Gordon and J Riedl 223Applying collaborative filtering to usenet news\224 Communications of the ACM 40\(3 1997, pp 77-87 7 B Mobasher 223Web Usage Mining and Personalization\224 Practical Handbook of Internet Computing CRC Press, 2004  B Mobasher H Dai T.

If the check fails, the statement cannot be executed. If they coexist in one or more AGs, the algorithm checks whether the method \223md1\224 can be invoked under the associations of the AGs the objects coexist \(by comparing the associations in the AGs with the ML of \223md1\224\ no association in the AGs is allowed to invoke the method, the statement cannot be executed. If one or more associations are allowed to invoke the method the algorithm identifies the common associations of the variables involved in the statement. If no common association is identified, labels of the statement are incomparable and the statement cannot be executed. If one or more common associations among the variables are identified, labels with any common association can be selected to check information flow security. If a common association causes the secure flow condition true, the information flow is considered secure. This consideration is reasonable. For example, if a worker is assigned to a manager and they are friends, the manager can play the role of either a manager or a friend to invoke the worker\222s methods  6. Case study  The example described in section 2 is revisited here We use the proposed model to label the application The labeling result is shown in Example 1. We simplify the example by hiding the possibly complicated structure of an attribute. For example the attributes \223general_info\224 of the object \223worker\224 may be as complicated as a C structure. Let\222s trace Example 1 to prove that the information flow control requirements described in section 2 are fulfilled Requirement 1 When a manager monitors a worker assigned to him, the manager can read the worker\222s general information, hour pay, and work hours This requirement is accomplished by the manager\222s method \223monitor\224 and the labels with the association \223assigned\224. To get the information of a worker, the manager\222s method \223monitor\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_info\224 using the manager\222s attributes \223worker_general_info\224 223worker_work_hour\224, and \223worker_hour_pay\224 as arguments. Comparing the label of 223worker_general_info\224 with that of the worker\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, the secure flow condition mentioned in section 4.4 is true \(note that the labels with the association \223assigned\224 are used here\herefore, the statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_info\224 can be executed. Moreover, the statements \223w_hour := work_hour;\224 and \223h_pay hour_pay;\224 within \223get_info\224 can be executed after a similar comparison Requirement 2 If a manager browses the information of a worker assigned to him, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker assigned to a manage, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 002 ML md1  if EFF_ASSO is empty then md1 is not allowed to invoke under the associations the information flow is not secure, exit algorithm end if  EFF_VAR_ASSO  EFF_ASSO  002   


The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels. Note that the manager\222s method 223browse\224 cannot read the worker\222s \223work_hour\224 and \223hour_pay\224. The rationale is described in the last paragraph of section 4.4 Requirement 3 If a worker is not assigned to a manager, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223not_assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker not assigned to a manager, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. The statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels Requirement 4 If a worker and a manager are friends, they can read each other\222s general information This requirement is achieved by the labels with the association \223friend\224. For example, a worker can read his manager friend\222s general information through the worker\222s method 223get_others_general_info\224, which invokes the manager\222s \223get_self_general_info\224 using the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. After comparing the label of the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 and the manager\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, one can see that the secure flow condition is true. The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the manager\222s method \223get_self_general_info;\224 can be executed Requirement 5 Periodically, the company invokes foreign objects to compute the salaries and taxes of workers This requirement is fulfilled by the stubs \223stub1\224 and stub2\224 in Example 1. Please refer to the description in section 4.3. Moreover, the three rules mentioned in section 3.2 prevent the foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses  7. Evaluation  We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. The system uses reusable software repository to simulate foreign object control. Moreover, it uses the language shown in Example 1 to write programs A program written in the language is first pre-processed to produce a program without labels and MLs. The program produced by the preprocessor is conceptually composed of two parts. One is the program before labeling and the other a security monitor The latter checks information flows of the former using Algorithm 1 during program execution Currently, the security monitor checks security dynamically, which contradicts the proposal of static checking [1, 12, 24  N e ve r t he l e ss d yna mi c c he c ki n g  cannot be totally avoided because objects and AGs may be dynamically instantiated or removed during program execution To evaluate the model, we used the example described in section 2 as an assignment to students of different grades and experiences. The students are required to develop a program, namely program a  without the proposed model embedded and another program, namely program b with the model embedded. We then collected and averaged the following metrics data: 1\ LOC \(lines of code\f programs a and b, 2\ecution time of programs a and b, and 3\numbers of non-secure statements found in program b. The collected data showed that the averaged LOC and execution time of program b are respectively 3.2 and 3.8 times those of program a Nevertheless, the data also showed that 2.3 non-secure information flows \(per 100 LOC\n average are identified from program b. Although the runtime overhead seems high, we still think that the model is valuable because of the ability to identify non-secure statements. Nevertheless, reducing the overhead should be an important future work  8. Related work  The simplest information flow control approach is DAC. Since DAC fails to avoid Trojan horses, the multilevel security approach was proposed [6-9  The approach is generally categorized as MAC MAC was criticized as too restricted [5 T o lo o s en  the restriction, quite a few approaches have been proposed. Below we survey some researches The model proposed in t rol s t h e  information flows in object-oriented systems. It uses ACL of objects to compute the ACL of executions. A message filter is used to filter out possibly non-secure information flows. Since the computation of an execution\222s ACL takes information propagation into consideration, no Trojan horses will result Moreover, interactions among executions are categorized into five modes including synchronized unrestricted, synchronous restricted, asynchronous deferred reply unrestricted, and deferred reply restricted. Different modes result in different ACLs Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 


which loosens the restriction of MAC. More flexibility is added to the model by allowing exceptions during or after method execution [10-11 The purpose-oriented model [21-22 pro pos es  that invoking a method may be allowed for some methods but disallowed for other methods, even when the invokers belong to the same object. This consideration is correct, because the security levels of methods in an object may be different Different methods can thus access information in different security levels The decentralized label approach [1-4 m a rk s t h e  security levels of variables using labels. A label is composed of one or more policies, which should be simultaneously obeyed. A policy in a label is composed of an owner and zero or more readers that are allowed to access the data. When computation are applied to data, join operation is used to compute the label of the result data. This avoids Trojan horses Another feature proposed by this approach is that declassification \(downgrading of security level provided. This allows non-sensitive data, which are in high security level, to be accessed by low security level processes. The model also takes write access control into consideration [4 rren t l y t h e m o d e l  has been used to develop a programming language Jflow [1 ad d itio n   th e m o d e l h a s b e e n  u s ed i n a  distributed system with untrusted hosts through secure program partitioning [30  Role-based access control models [19, 27, 33  define the roles a subject can play. A role is a collection of permissions \(i.e., access rights  When a subject plays a role, it possesses the rights belonging to the role. A subject can play multiple roles and even change role during a session Inheritance and other relationships can be established among roles [27 t o s t ru ct u re t h e m Moreov er  constraints, such as two specific roles should be mutually exclusive, can be attached to roles. The advantage of role-based access control is that subjects can change roles dynamically, which facilitates obeying the \223need-to-know\224 principle. It seems that the role-based models operate well in an application that protects not too many resources because roles should be defined before the application\222s execution. In case that many resources should be protected \(such as every variable in a program should be protected\ining roles becomes tedious and the access control may become imprecise From the survey, we identified many necessary features for controlling information flows in object-oriented systems such as Trojan horse prevention, declassification, purpose-oriented method invocation, and so on. In fact, our model offers those features, although we do not present them in this paper. What we present in this paper are the control of information flows among objects and foreign objects. According to our survey, no model offers the control well  9. Conclusions  This paper proposes a model to control information flows among objects. The model uses associations and method limitations \(ML\ to control information flows among objects. Information flows are controlled by attaching labels to variables. Trojan horses are avoided by join operations. Within an application, every variable and literal is associated with one or more labels. If a variable is associated with multiple labels, each label enforces the security policy of an association. To check the security of an information flow, labels are compared. An information flow is secure if the comparison causes the secure flow condition true In addition to controlling objects developed by programmers, the model also controls foreign objects which are pre-existing objects for reused. Since the details of a foreign object are unknown, our model only prevents foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses. We use the \223Suppression rule\224, \223No ML rule\224 and \223Stuck to rules\224 to control foreign objects We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. From the data collected, we found that the model does facilitate identifying non-secure information flows. We thus believe that the model is useful in spite of runtime overhead  Acknowledgement  This research is sponsored by the National Science Council in Taiwan under Grant NSC91-2213-E-259-006  References  1  A  C.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type.

Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
