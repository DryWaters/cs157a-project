We often use different algorithms to mine them. In the past few years, the technology, frequent closed itemsets mining, is introduced. It will generate a small set of rules compared with the traditional frequent itemset mining without infomation loss. In this paper, based on the theory of Galois Connection, we introduce a new unified structure to mine the three different kinds of rules. The strncture is called Frequent Closed Itemsets Lattiw. We only need to add additional simple function to the algorithm that builds the structure to carry out the process of mining. We find the new structure is very nsePul and promising Keywords Frequent closed itemsetv lattice 1. Introduction Association rule; Classification rule; Clustering Rule Data mining is to efficiently discover interesting rules from large collections of data. The problems of mining association rules [1,2,3], classification rules [4,5] and clustering rules have been the subjects of numerous studies Association rules mining finds the useful rules existing in the databases that satisfy the preseting minimum support and minimum confidence constraints Classification rules mining aims to discover a small set of rules in the databases to form an efficient classifier. We want to cluster the transaction in the databases into different classes when we mine the clustering rules. When mining the Association rules and clustering rules, we don't know the target in advance. However, we know the target before we begin to mine classification rules. Just because association rules, classification rules and clustering rules are all very useful in the pragmatic application, it is significant if we can build a unified structure to mine the three kinds of rules Frequent itemset mining must be an important process in the structure. However, it will generate too many frequent itemsets. In the past few years, a new technology frequent closed itermsets mining, is introduced [6,7,8,9]. It extracts a particular subset of the frequent itemsets that can regenerate the whole without information loss. In this paper we introduce a new structure called Frequent Closed Itemsets Lattice. It makes full use of the Galois Connection theory. We can mine the three kinds of rules through adding a new simple function to the algorithm that builds the lattice. So, this method is useful and promising In Section 2, we present the theory foundation of the new structure. In Section 3, we introduce the FCIL algorithm to build the new structure-Frequent closed itemsets lattice. In section 4, we discuss how to mine association rules under this structure. Using the structure we mine classification rules in section 5 and clustering rules in section 6. Section 7 is a brief conclusion 2. Theoretical Foundation In this section, we define the data mining context Galois connection, Galois closure operator, closed itemsets and frequent closed itemsets lattice Definition 1 \(Data mining context is a triple D=\( r ,Z ,R the columns are the itemsets Z . RG r X Z is a relation between the transactions and itemsets Definition 2 \(Galois Connection r , Z  ,R mining context. For T c r and I c Z , we define

The closed itemset C is the itemset whose support is equal to its closure. If the support is higher than the minimum support, the closed itemsets called frequent closed itemsets Definition 5 \(Frequent closed itemsets lattice the itemsets C in the closure to build a complete lattice C, 5 According to the above defmition, we can conclude 1 can be treat in the closure of the superset; \(2 rule A + B, if A and AB are both in the same closure, the confidence is 1. So we can distinguish the rule into two categories: the class 1 is those rules have the confidence=l the class 2 is those have the confidence between min-conf and 1. \(3 the problem of fmding frequent closed itemsets instead, just because it will generate less rule without information loss 3. Frequent Closed Itemsets Lattice We use the following example in this section Example Table 1 C D W A C T W A C D W 6 C D T column is the items contain in the transaction and the class label is in the third column We should construct the lattice at first. Generally, we sort the itemsts in lexicographic order, hut nowadays we find if we put items in specific order, it will improve the efficiency of the process. We use the support-based order introduced in paper[9]. Also do we sort the frequent 1-item in support-based ascend order and use the same Itemset-Tidset structure. We propose FCIL algorithm to construct the Frequent closed itemsets lattice according to the ascend order of I-item D,T,A,W,C\(Figure 1 find the advantage of the lattice: 1 extract frequent closed itemsets easily through the lattice.2 We can draw 'the interesting rules straightforward without information loss m DWC\(245 35 1 5 135 TAWC\(135 Figure 1 The FCIL algorithm Input: T[l]\(in ascend order Output: frequent closed itemsets lattice

We also can extract the rule from the different frequent closed itemsets closure based on the pre-set min-Conf hen we can prune the redundant rules from the table For instance: we find A + W, A -+ WC and AC --3 W are at the same row and column, their confidence are equal Also can we find that the addition of item C to either the antecedent or the decedent of the rule A + W has no function. So we can say that the rule A + W is the general one. Using this idea, we can get the final collections of rules are \(TW-+A, A+W, W+C, T+C,  D+C C+W, W+A We can add a function association D DW T TA A W C I I I algorithm to realize .the process of extract -Association rules Function: Association 1 candidate rules with Conf=l 2 candidate rules with conf between min-Conf and I 4 5. Mining the Classification rules by frequent closed itemsets lattice 


itemsets lattice When consbuct the flat classifier, we have to pay attention to the following problems 1 Some AI method can build a classifier, but it is really a black box, we cannot understand the thing in it. We want only a white box. In the process of classification, we should under the process definitely 2 Features should be determined by the class 3 In classification problems, we will have a lot of characterized features. So we should choose the proper Generally, we know the target class in advance space in the high dimensional space, or we cannot classify the feature correctly According to the above problems, we can find the frequent closed itemsets based classifier is a well choice We can choose the feature spaces in response to the target class, so do we know the classifier In the third column of the Table 1, there are the class labels of the respective transactions. Let us pay attention to one sub-tree of the frequent closed itemsets lattice in figure 2 TAWl3S Figure 2 We can find if we use the any one in the same closure will have the same classify ability. So we choose the simple one TA or TW to classify. Just because W is posterior to A in order at level 1, so we choose TA after all Using the idea, we can get the candidate classification rules from the frequent closed itemsets collections \(Table 3 In the table 3, we also list the correct classification result of the transactions on the respective rules. In the bracket are According to the correctness of the classifiers D + Class 2 and A -+ Class 1 have the highest correctness\(75 is the full tidset. So Use the two rules we can classify the tidset We should note that 1 classify the tidset with the same efficiency, we choose the simple one according to the order at the level 1. 2 more rules have the classification ability, we choose the one has the highest correctness. 3 then we delete the transactions it can classify correctly in the tidset. We choose the additional rules according to the remainder in the tidset In previous algorithms, if we want to draw classification rules we have to do another algorithm However, now we can make full use of the frequent closed itemsets lattice made in the section 3. We only need to add a new function to the FCIL algorithms called classify Function: Classify 1 1747 Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Shmghai  26-29 August 2004 itemsets 2 3 classification efficiency of the simple one according to the class label 4  5 Sub-Function: Choose 1 Structure 2 the order sequence at level 1 3 then choose the new rules to classify the remainder in the tidset 


tidset 6 itemsets lattice Clustering the transactions by frequent closed We find the lattice can also be used to cluster the transactions Table 4 1 C D W A C D W rZcrw 5 A C D T W 6 D 3 Transaction 1 and 3 belong to the same class I\(TAWC just because they have the same itemsets. Transaction 2 and tranactions 6 belong to the class 2\(DWC DC because they are belong to the different frequent closed itemsets closure. Then we focus on transaction 4 and 5 According to tranaction 4\(DAWC in the lattice because it is not frequent. Then we consider the nearest subset of it has 3 items: DAW, DAC, DWC and AWC. We cannot find DAW and DAC but DWC and AWC Because the support of AWC is higher than that of DWC so we classify it to the class AWC belongs. With respect to transaction 5, we use the same method and consider the following itemsets: DTAW, DTAC, DTWC, DAWC and TAWC. We only find the TAWC, so we classify it into class 1. So we get the table 4 1 closure of it 2 class the closure belongs 3 highest support belongs 4 5 closure belongs We can get the function cluster 6 highest support belongs 7. Conclusions Association rules, classification rules and clustering rules mining are indispensable to practical applications. In the past few years, the technology--frequent closed itemsets mining is introduced. It will generate rules smaller than the traditional frequent itemset mining without information loss In this paper, based on the theory of Galois Connection, we introduce a new unified structure to mine the three kinds of rules. The structure is called Frequent closed itemsets based lattice. We can add additional function to the structure to carry out the process of mining.

Path loss exponent = 3.5. ?L = ?4dB users to one base station even if the user is closer to another base station \(unless the user is very far away from the base station interference cancellation could be effective only for users associated with the base station. This is illustrated in figure 4 Figure 3\(b utility function at nR = 1, 2, 4. Similarly, significant gains are observed at all nR 6 Conclusions In this paper, we consider a generic multi-cell system with K client users \(each with single antenna each with nR antennas and multiuser detector time, a user could be associated with one base station only. Encoding and decoding terminates at the base station level. The problem is to find the optimal dynamic user association with the nB base Figure 4: Illustration of the advantage to associate users with one base station. It is better to associate mobile 1, 2, 3 to base station A \(even if mobile 3 is closer to base station B mobile 4 should be associated with base station B because it is very close to the base station stations such that the system performance is optimized. We proposed an analytical framework for the above macroscopic scheduling problem and introduce a greedy sub-optimal solution. We show that when multi-user detection is incorporated in base stations, the conventional camp-on-the-strongest-cell approach is far from optimal. For example, we illustrated that there are 4 time of throughput gain between the proposed greedy algorithm and the conventional algorithm at various nR. This is because with multi-user detection it is advantageous to associate users to a common base station due to interference cancellation unless the user is very far away from the base station. We found that the scheduling gain increases with decreasing path loss exponent because of the increase in the effective overlapping area between cells References 1] S.

CBA and Neural Networks at 1% confidence level while they are all significantly better than C4.5 decision tree. Taking the interpretability of classification model into account, these two adapted CBA algorithm seem to be appropriate choices for credit scoring because they generated much more compact decision lists \(less sequential rules original CBA. They therefore favour the well-known Occam  s Razor theory and are more suitable for decision makers to understand. A deeper insight into the rules structures shows that original CBA and adapted CBA 1 both focus on generating classification rules that predict good clients \(with bad clients as the default class implication, numerous rules with high confidence but low support have lower ranks than they are in original CBA. These rules are finally discarded since they are not fired by any training samples, which are matched by these rules with higher intensity of implications thus making the decision lists generated by adapted CBA 1 more compact. Adapted CBA 2 mainly mines these classification rules for bad clients \(with good clients as the default class compact rule sets Original CBA Adapted CBA1 Adapted CBA2 C45 NN dataset accuracy no. of rules accuracy num. of rules accuracy no. of rules accuracy accuracy 1 Austr 85.65% 130.5 86.52% 26.4 86.96% 12.4 86.52% 85.07 2 Germ 73.30% 134 74.40% 56.5 73.20% 19.7 72.40% 74.90 3 Bene 72.92% 393 72.30% 186 73.51% 51 70.21% 72.63 Table 2.

Conclusion Intensity of implication is proposed in the beginning as an interestingness measure for association rules Another novel interestingness measure called dilated chi-square is designed by us to reveal the statistical interdependence between the antecedents and consequents of association rules We then adapt CBA algorithm, which can be used to build classifiers based on class association rules, by coupling it with intensity of implication and dilated chi-square respectively. More concretely, Intensity of implication \(or dilated chi-square primary criterion to rank class association rules at the first step of the database coverage pruning procedure in CBA algorithm. Experiments on three credit scoring datasets proved that these two adapted algorithms compared with original CBA, classical C4.5 decision tree and neural network, achieve satisfactory performance and generates classifiers much more compact than CBA 6.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p.

More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type.

Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
