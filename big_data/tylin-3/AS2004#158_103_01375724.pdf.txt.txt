In order to be reliable in a decision making process, such discovered rules have to be concise and easily understandable for users or as well as an input to visualization tools. In this paper we present a 3D Histograms -based visualization prototype for handling generic bases of association rules. An interesting feature of the prototjpe is that it provides a '*contextual" exploration of such rule set. Such additional displayed knowledge, based on the construction of fuzzy meta-rules. enhances man-machine interaction by emulating a cooperative behavior I .  INTRODLJCTION With wide applications of computers and automated data collection tools, massive amounts of data have been contin uously collected and stored in databases, which creates an imminent need and great opportunities for mining interesting knowledge from data. Association rule mining is one kind of data mining techniques which discovers strong association or correlation relationships among data. Much research in data mining from large databases has focused on the discovery of association rules [I], [ 2 ] .  Association rule generation is achieved from a set F of frequent itemsets in an extraction context D, for a minimal support minsupp. An association rule r is a relation between itemsets of the form I' : X 9 \(Y - X X E I-. itemsets X and \(Y - X antecedent and conclusion of the rule r. The valid association rules are those of which the measure of confidence Conflr support\(Y YILPJ s l  IS greater than or equal to the minimal threshold of confidence, named rninconJ If Conf\(r is called exact associution rule \(ER approxiinutiw ussociation rule \(A R The problem of the relevance and usefulness of extracted association mles is of primary importance. Indeed, in most real life databases, thousands and even millions of high-confidence rulcs are generated among which many are redundant. This problem encouraged the development of tools for rule clas sification according to their properties, for rule selection according to user-defined criteria. and for rule visualization The number of tnnsacticms of'D containing Y .  i.e., support\(Y Y t E-mail: mephu@cril.univ-artois.fr Various techniques are used to limit thc number of re ported rules, starting by basic pruning techniques based on thresholds for both the frequency of the represented pattcm and the strength of the dependency between antecedent and conclusion. This pruning can be based on patterns defined by the user \(user-d&amp;ned templates   5]. The number of rules can be reduced through pruning based on additional information such as a taxonomy on items [6] or a metric of specific interest [7] \(e.g., Pearson's correlation or k2-test More advanced techniques that produce only a limited number of the entire set of rules rely on closures and Galois connections [8], which arc in turn derived from Galois lattice theory and formal concept analysis \(FCA  on FCA have yielded a row of results on compact representa tions of closed set families, also called buses, whose impact on association rule reduction is currently under intensive 


on association rule reduction is currently under intensive investigation within the community [8 Visualization tools allow users to work in an interactive en vironment with ease in understanding rules. In a based-tabular view of association rules, all strong rules are represented in a tabular rcprcsentation format \(rule table corresponding to a rule. Ail rules can be displayed in difkrent order, such as ordcr by antecedent, conclusion, support or confidence. This helps users to have a clearer view of the rules and locates a particular rule more easily. The tabular view is very suitable for representing large number of rules with varied length, and easily understood. As a drawback, tabular-based technique draws heavily on "boring" logical inference that a user should perform, and is not suitable for visualizing rules from different aspects. For example, if a user is interested in a comprehensive view of the relationship between rules and items. In this case, the tabular view is not very convenient since an item is repetitively appeared in the rule table as long as it i s  contained by a rule. These facts underline the importance of graphical rules visualization tools, permitting a more clear and vivid view of the rules and items. Indeed visual representation have the capability of shifting load from the user's cognitive system to the perceptual system [ l O l However, as pointed out in the dedicated literature, the 3D Histograms-based technique is actually interesting if only a small size of rules are handled 0-7803-8353-2/04/$20.00 0 2004 IEEE 227 FUZZ-IEEE 2004 In this papcr, we are interested in presenting a graph-based visualization prototype for handling generic bascs of associ ation rulcs. Wc find that a 3D histograms-bascd technique is particularly well suited for visualizing such \(non-redundant bascs of association rulcs. Indeed, their sizes is by far lower than the set of all \(redundant feature of the aforementioned prototype is that it provides a contextual" exploration of such rule set. For example. if a user selects a given rule, then all the "connected" rules are displayed to the user in  an interactive manner. The contextual interaction is performed through the construction of  fuzzy meta-rules, i.e.. rules where both premises and conclusions arc composed of rulcs. It is noteworthy that, such additional displayed knowledge allows an iinprovemcnt man-machinc intcraction by emulating a cooperative behavior, as depicted by Figure 1 graphical representation based cooperative behaviour A Fig. 1. Improving man-machine interaction The rcmaindcr of this papcr is organized as follows. Section 2 sketches briefly the mathematical background for the extrac tion of generic bases of association rules. After a review of the related work, in Section 3 we present the process of the extraction of fizzy association meta-rules. Then we discuss i n depth in Section 4 the opportunity of the rule set contextual cxploration. Section 5 concludes this paper and points out future research directions 11. EXTRACTING ENERIC BASES OF ASSOCIATION RULES In the following, we recall some key results from the Galois lattice-based paradigm in FCA and its applications to association rules mining. A formal context is a hiplet R = \(O .A:R or transactions binary relation \(i.e., R C D x 7 a cxprcsscs that thc transaction o E 0 contains the attribute U E A. We definc two functions that map sets of objects to sets of attributes and vice versa. Thus, for a set 0 0. we define 4\(0 I  I Yo. o E 0 +- \(0, a A o, a tl? form a Galois connection between the respective power sets P\(d 0 of Q and y; arc closure operators, in particular i~ = Q o 4

In the remaining of the paper such structure is referred to "Iceberg Galois Lattice 13], given an Iceberg Galois lattice, representing prcccdence-relation-based ordercd closcd itemsets, generic bases of association rules can be dcrivcd in a straightforward manner. We assume that in such structure. each closed itemsct is "decorated" with its associatcd list of minimal generators. Hence, A R represent "inter-node" implications assorted with a statistical information, i.e.. the confidence from a sub-closed-itemset to a super-closed-itemset while starting from a given node in an ordered structure. Inversely ER are "intra-node" implications extracted from each node in the ordered structure. Once these generic bases were obtained all the remaining \(redundant Indccd. to do so it is sufficient to augmcnt a generic rule's antecedent by an itcm of thc same rule's conclusion For example, let us consider the transaction database given by Table I \(Left with their associated minimal generators, is depicted by Ta ble I \(Right extracted ER and AR that it may be possible to derive for minsup=l With respect to [12] and TAR1.E 1 LEFT: TRANSACTION DATABASE RIGHT: CLOSFD ITFMSETS LIST I 2 I aek I I Gen.

Sketch of associatcd rules in XML format and its associated internal DTD A sketch of the XML file storing these association rules is depicted by Figure 2. 'This storing format is argued by the fact that XML, the extensible Markup Language, has recently emerged as a new standard for data representation and exchange on the lntemet. The basic ideas undcrlying XML arc very simple: tags on data clenients identify the mcaning of thc data. rather than, c.g., specifying how the data should be formatted \(as in HTML between data elements are provided via simple nesting and references. Yet the potential impact is significant: Web servers and applications encoding their data in XML can quickly make their information available in a simple and usable format. and such information providers can interoperate easily 111. EX'I RAC-I iNG FULZY ASSOCIAI~ION RULES In the following, we present the basic fuzzy constructs and our proper notations, then we sketch the related work in the literature for the discovery of fuzzy association rules A. Basic F u q In this paragraph, we recall some basic constructs from fuzzy sets framework Fuzzy Sets : Let 1: be a finite cl_assical set ofobjects, called universe ofdiscourse. A fuzzy set F. in  a universe of discourse U ,  is characterized by a membership function i f F :  U + [Cl: 11 where p F \( u }  denotes the degree of membership of t i  in thc  fuzzy set F. Hence, the fuzzy set is denoted by : F In the following, thc notion of fuzzy extraction context made up of objects and attributes, related undcr a fuzzy typc-1 rclation. is formalized F u z y  extcagion context :A fuzzy extraction contcxt is a triple D=\(g.X,R finite set Z of database items \(or descriptors binary relation R \(i.e.,R 0 x denotes that the object o E 0, has the item i E Z, at least with a dcgrec 0 Fuzzy Galois connection: Let 5 = \(0. ?. 5 5xtraction context,For X - C  0 cnd ?' 2, the functions 6 : P\(0 1 T 0 follows [14 LP\(Ul 2 \( 2 U,&gt If] , 11' , . . . . 21 c E l  ck = utin{pR\(a, b Qr b b The fuzzy operator b is applied on a crisp set of objects and determines to which degree each property is satisfied b j all objects, according to their respective degrees. Note that 9 a5 defined formerly, presents a desired abstraction vocation Indeed. the retrieved fuzzy set is the least generalization through the "min" function, of all fuzzy sets \(or descriptions associated respectivcly to the input-set objccts Similarly, the fuzzy operator t', is applied on a set of propcrtics, rcprcscnted by a f'uzzy set, and detcrmincs to which degree each object satisfies all of them. The implicit use of the Resdie-Guines fuzzy implication pemiits to obtain the desired iizterpretution effect. Hence, the operator "2" permits to filter only objects fulfilling the constraint that the associated descriptions are more general than the input description Remark I: It is noteworthy that the proposed definition of fuzzy Galois connection -without context transformation- can not be unique. This constatation is due to the existence of multitude of semanticisyntactic parameters to take into account in any extension to the fuzzy context \(e.g., fuzzy implica tion choice 


tion choice implication propositions of Belohlavek [ 151 and Pollandt [ 161 where a fuzzy formal gonceptis define$ by2 p i r  of two fuzzy sets X and Y ,  where X = G \( Y X referred to [ 141 for a critical discussion on these propositions bascd on semantic interpretations attachcd to mcmbcrship dc grees in a fuzzy set \(i.e.,fulfillment, preference,interpretation B. Related work In [ 171, the authors w r e  intcrcsted in mining quantitative association rules over quantitative and categorical attributcs To do  so, the values of categorical attributes are mapped to a set of consecutive integers and the values of quantitative attributes are first discretized into intervals using equi-depth partitioning, if necessary, and then mapped to consecutive integers to preserve the order of the valueshtervals. And as a result. both categorical and quantitative attributes can be handled in a uniform fashion as a set of &lt;attribute, integcr value&gt; pairs. With the mappings dcfined in [I 11, a quantitative 229 FUZZ-IEEE 2004 association rule is mapped to a set of boolean association rules. Aftcr the mappings, an algorithm for mining boolcan association rulcs \(e.g. that presentcd in [18 to the transformed data set. Howevcr, thcse intervals may not be concise and meaningful enough for human experts to easily obtain nontrivial knowledge from those rules discovered. To overcome discretization drawbacks, Chan et ul. [ 191 utilized linguistic terms to represent the revealed regularities and exceptions. The motivation behind this is that the linguistic representation i s  especially useful when those discovered rules are presented to human experts for examination, because of the afinity with the human knowledge representations. The dcfinition of linguistic tcrms is bascd on fuzzy set theory and thereforc, rules having thesc terms arc callcdfhzzy associution rules Chen et a1 [201, [21] extracted implications of the form X + Y where either X or Y is a collection of fuzzy sets The extraction process is based upon fuzzy taxonomies that reflect partial belongings among data items, as well as upon the cxtended algorithms to discovcr association rules across the highcr-level taxonomic nodes that arc k z y  sets in gcncral Thrce types of fuzzy association rulcs with taxonomic nodcs linguistic terms and hedges were discussed respectively, along with their mining stratcgics In this paper, we are interested in extracting fEzzx as sociation rules of the form f :  I1 + I,, where 11, I, 2 I = \(01. n2.. . . : a p ,  aq,. . . . a i } ,  and I1 = {a1,a2.. . . ,ab and 72 = {E;, . . . .;} il and 1 2  are called. respectively the antecedent part and conclusion par? of the fuzzy rule E The value a,,z = 1 ,... n. is called local weight of the itcm a,. This value indicates thc relativc degrce of  importancc of cach itcm contributing to the conclusion of the rule, and plays an important role in many real world problems. For cxamplc, in medical diagnostic systems, it is conimon to assign a local weight to each symptom in ordcr to show the relative importance \(weight conclusion \(a disease It is noteworthy that extracting fuzzy association rules is far froni bcing a trivial task. comparcd to thc boolcan case, mostly because of the huge size of the f w  extraction context and conscqucntly thc numbcr of potentially intcresting fuzzy rules that can be drawn from a such fuzzy dataset. In this respect rcducing such set of fuzzy rules is a critical issue C. The FARD algorithm The FARD [22] algorithm fdk in the "test-and-generate characterization for mining frequent \(cioscd rithms. It handles as input an extended transaction databasc c.g, a database in which quantities of the purchascd items arc available. Thc peculiarity of the FARD algorithm stands in the fact that it is dcdicatcd. Indeed, it tackles the original context without binarizing it, since it takes advantage of the particular properties of the fuzzy descriptions to limit the computation 


effort The algorithm traverses iteratively thc search spacc in a level-wise manncr. During each iteration corresponding to a Q1 a2 QP a ffl a2 a x level. a set of candidate patterns is created by joining frequent pattems discovcrcd during the previous itcration, thc supports of all candidate pattcms arc countcd and infrcqucnt oncs are discarded. Fuzzy association rulcs are generated in two successive steps 1 FuFCs 2 gcncrate all fuzzy association rulcs that it is possible to dcrivc As i n p t  the FARD algorithm takes a fuzzy extraction context V, minsup and minconf: In this paper, we consider that the fuzzy extraction context V is constituted as follows V = \(0, RS. R Rs is a finite set o f  ER and AR and R is a fuzzy binary relation, where pa\(o&gt;R R U AR Following the general principle of a level-wise algorithm thc FARD algorithm performs in each itcration the fallowing two steps \(assuming that items are sorted in a lexicographic order 1 plied to each generator in CFuFC,. determining its support and possibly its closure \(if it is frequent enough This set is pruned with respect the anti-monotonous constraint. through the tnmsup threshold 2 next itcration, i.e. CFuFC,+1, is computed by applying thc GEN-NEXT function to the set CFuFC The algorithm terminates when there are no more generators to process, i.e. CFuFC,.gen-list, i s  empty. FARD algorithm pseud code is givcn in Algorithm 1 .  Note that sub-routincs pseudo code is not givcn due to lack of available space Algorithm 1: FARD Input: 5 : fiuzy extraction context, S:items user constraints, minsup Output: FuFC= U, FuFC begin CFuFCl .gen-list={ 1-fuzzy itemsets for \(a = l:CFuFC,.gen-list# @;i FuFC,=GEN-CI,OSE~\(CFUFC FuFC return FuFC=U,FuFC end Examnple 2: Let us considcr the fuzzy extraction context depicted by Table 111. In this context, each \( R 8 . j means that the object j is covered by the rule R, with a confidence equal to cy. From such context, by applying the FARD, it is possible to cxtract thc fuzzy closed itcmscts from which we dcrivc fuzzy ER, which are depictcd by Table 1V Q 230 25-29 Juiy, 2004 Budapest, Hungary TABIX 111 F L / I ~  MI- I 2-C Oh 1 LX 1 TAR1.F: 1V EXACT FIJZZY META-ASSOCIATION RLI,ES S F T Let us keep in mind that given a non-redundant rule set we aim to set up a graphical visualization prototype permit ting to enhance the man-machine interaction by providing a contextual "know ledge", minimizing a boring large amount of knowledge exploration. To do so. we construct a set of fuzzy meta-rules, where both antecedent and conclusion rule's are made up of classical association rules. The role of such fuzzy meta-rules is to highlight "connections" between association rules without loosing rule's confidence information Here we come to a turning point: Why is it interesting to try to understand why a user andior a knowledge expert may be interested in a particular rule, and to determine what 


may be interested in a particular rule, and to determine what interesting information or knowledge, not explicitly requested we could provide him, in addition to the proper answer Indeed. improving man-machine interaction by emulating a cooperative behavior has been proposed by some researchers through various techniques [23]. In [24], the author states requests .for datu can he clawified rotcgltlv into two kinds specific requests and gods. A .spec$c request e.stahli.rhes U rigid quul$cation, and is concerned only with data that mutchrs it precisely A goal, on the other hund, r9tahliske.s N furget yuufifkution and is concerned with datu which is close to the target". For Cuppens and Demolombe [25], "the basic idea is tiwt witen a person asks a question. he is not interested to know the answer+ju.st o increase his knowfedge, hit he hus the intention to realize some action. aizd the answer contains necesscity or z1s&amp; in&amp;wmcrtion to reulize riais action". In our context, when such additional knowledge is not supplied. this forces the user to retry a tedious rule exploration repeatedly until obtaining a satisfactory "matching In the prototype interface, c.f., Figure 3\(Up select items that can both appear in the preniise and/or the conclusion part. Once the minsup and minconf thresholds are fixed, the user can generate the desired rules. Both textual and graphical representation are provided. The user can fur ther filter specific rules from the generated ones. In the 3D histograms based visualization, c.f., Figure 3\(Down items are showed in red, whiie those of the conclusion are depicted in blue. The associated Confidence and support are represented by a scaled histogram For example, supposc that a user may bc interested in the rule RI. Then, when the user clicks on the label representing the R I  antecedent, the visualization interface provides in a displaying area all rules that are connected to RI. From the meta-rule MR1 depicted in Table IV, we can check that the following rules are connected to RI: R3 : e=+k \(conf.=l k+e \(conf.=O.X conf.=OA conf.=0.5 The aforementioned visualization prototype is currently un der implementation and we show in the following how its fea tures fulfill the Sclzneitlernzan's visual design guidelines [26 The author recommended the following tasks "Uven&amp;w ,firxt zoom und,fiLtec then detuils on demand". In fact, grasping a huge mount of rules can very often encourage user to pcrfomi a superficial exploration instead of a in-depth one. That's why, our visualization tool has to provide an overview of the derived association rules. which permits an overall knowledge direct access and interconnections within the knowledge space Once the user focused on a rule \(or a portion of rules smooth user-zooming capability should be performed. We try to implement to . f ish9v technique to perform such task, by keeping the context while zooming on the focused portion of knowledge. In addition to the complete description of the desired portion of rules \(i.e.. premise, conclusion and confidence the derivable rules that can be draw from such generic rule set We have also to mention the desired "reiute" task [26 highlighting useful relationships among knowledge. Therefore 231 FUZZ-IEEE 2004 Fig. 3 DOWN UP the system as described earlicr, thanks to its meta-rules base will display the set of connected rules V. CONCLUSION We presented in this paper an approach for providing a cooperative exploration of generic bases of association rules This additional knowiedge highlighting connected rules to a user-select rules permits an improvement of man-machine interaction. To do so. we constructed a set of fuzzy mcta-rules extracted from the discovered fuzzy closed itemsets 


extracted from the discovered fuzzy closed itemsets The visualization prototype is currently under implemen tation and in the near future. we plan to include also rec ommended visualization tasks, e.g., history and extract 1261 and to lead extensive experimental results to assess their satisfaction vs the user graphical interface R E  t  E R EN C ES I ]  R .

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
