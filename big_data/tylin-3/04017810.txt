Mining Positive and Negative Association Rules from Large Databases Chris Cornelis Dept Appl Math and Comp Sci Ghent University Ghent Belgium Chris.Cornelis@UGent.be Peng Yan Xing Zhang Guoqing Chen School of Economics and Management Tsinghua University Beijing China  yanp,zhangx4,chengq  em.tsinghua.edu.cn Abstract  This paper is concerned with discovering positive and negative association rules a problem which has been addressed by various authors from different angles but for which no fully satisfactory solution has yet been proposed We catalogue and critically examine the existing denitions and approaches and we present an Apriori-based algorithm that is able to nd 
all valid positive and negative association rules in a supportcondence framework Efciency is guaranteed by exploiting an upward closure property that holds for the support of negative association rules under our denition of validity Keywords association rules data mining Apriori I I NTRODUCTION The idea of association rule AR mining already dates back to H  ajek et al Its application t o m ark e t bask e t analysis i.e to the discovery of co-occurence relationships among purchased items in supermarket transaction databases gained enormous popularity after its re-introduction by Agrawal et al i n t he mid-nineties Apart f rom a lgorithmic e f cienc y and ease of implementation by algorithms like Apriori its appeal is also due to its wide applicability researchers have 
successfully exported the AR concept originally specic to binary data tables to a multitude of domains involving quantitative hierarchical fuzzy and many other kinds of databases At the heart of all these methods is the ability to predict that given the presence in a database record transaction of one pattern frequent itemset X  the record is likely to contain another pattern Y as well concisely summed up by the positive rule X  Y  Recently the problem of identifying negative associations or dissociations addressing also the absence of itemsets has been explored and considered relevant see e.g   3  4  5  11 13  14  15  16  17 
For instance a shop manager may like to be informed that customers who buy an IBM notepad are unlikely to buy a D-link network card Mining negative association rules however raises a number of critical issues First of all in typical supermarket transaction databases there are thousands of items wares and each record customer transaction only contains a few of them For a database containing 10,000 items such that each customer on average buys 10 of them the density of the database is 0.1 From the perspective of negative patterns indicating absence of items the density is a soaring 99.9 leading to explosive amounts of mostly uninteresting rules Secondly the complexity of AR mining algorithms is exponential in the number of items if for each item from the database a 
corresponding negated item indicating absence of the original item is considered the computational costs will skyrocket As a consequence the way a valid negative association rule is dened plays an important role Finally as we will point out further on the introduction of negative association rules invalidates some important pruning aids used to restrict the search space and guarantee efciency in classical algorithms Existing approaches have tried to address these problems by incorporating attribute correlations or rule interestingness measures to lter out unimportant rules or by relying on additional background information concerning the data As opposed to this the aim of this paper is to propose a computationally workable approach that stays within the strict bounds of the original support-condence framework Such an approach has the advantage of being intuitive to users no 
additional parameters required and may serve as a skeleton for the development of more specialized mining algorithms The paper is structured as follows the next section recalls preliminaries about ARs and compares two alternative ways to dene negative ARs In Section 3 existing strategies to mining negative ARs are reviewed The core of the paper is Section 4 where rst we propose a suitable denition of valid negative association rule and then proceed to spell out and evaluate a new Apriori-based algorithm for nding all valid positive and negative association rules Section 5 offers a brief conclusion and suggests future work in this direction II P OSITIVE AND N EGATIVE A 
SSOCIATION R ULES A Support-Conﬁdence Framework of Positive ARs Let D   t 1 t 2 t n  be a relational database of n records or transactions with a set of binary attributes or items I   i 1 i 2 i m   For an itemset X I and a transaction t in D  we say that t supports X if t 
has value 1 for all the attributes in X  for conciseness we also write X  t By D X we denote the records that contain all attributes in X  The support of X is computed as supp  X   D X   n  i.e the fraction of transactions containing X  A positive 1ñ4244ñ0023ñ6/06/$20.00 c  2006 IEEE CIS 2006 


association rule is of the form X  Y  with X Y I  X  Y    Support and condence of X  Y are dened as supp  X  Y  supp  XY  and conf  X  Y  supp  XY   supp  X  respectively 1  A valid positive association rule has support and condence greater than given thresholds ms and mc 2 Furthermore an itemset X is called frequent if supp  X   ms  B Negative Association Rules What exactly constitutes a negative association rule In literature two formats prevail Denition I in   11  15 17 t he traditional denition of itemset is maintained so X  Y I  and to each positive rule X  Y correspond three negative ones X  Y   X  Y and  X  Y  A transaction t supports X   Y if X  t and Y   t  Hence the meaning of a rule like  i 1  i 2 i 3  is that the appearance of i 1 in a transaction t induces that i 2 and i 3 are unlikely to appear simultaneously in t  hence a record containing i 1 and i 2 but not i 3  supports this rule It can be veried  17 t hat supp  X  Y  supp  X  Y  supp  X   supp  XY  for X Y I  and similarly support and condence of the other kinds of negative ARs can be be straightforwardly deduced from the corresponding positive itemset supports The total number of positive and negative ARs that can be generated is 4\(3 m  2 m 1 1  of which 3 m  2 m 1 1  i.e one fourth are positive Although theoretically the complexity of mining both positive and negative ARs is in the same level as that of mining only positive ARs naive implementations will run into trouble this is because one of the most important pruning aids in Apriori namely that supersets of infrequent positive itemsets need not be considered as they cannot be frequent downward closure property of supp  is no longer valid for negative itemsets For the latter a dual upward closure property of supp holds if supp   X   ms  then for every Y I such that and X  Y      XY  also meets the support threshold As a consequence all these frequent negative itemsets must be further considered and many meaningless negative rules with large consequents will arise In Section IV we will show how to exploit the upward closure property to dene an alternative denition of validity for negative ARs and to restrict the search space of our mining algorithm Denition II in 4 16 authors v ie w each item s opposite as a new item which can be inserted into I to derive I   I i 1   i 2   i m   Since no transaction contains both an item and its opposite we can restrict our attention to those itemsets that do not contain i j and  i j simultaneously for j 1 m  An example of a possible negative rule under this denition is  i 1  i 2   i 3   a transaction t supports it if i 1 012 t  i 2  012 t and i 3  012 t  Hence the meaning of this rule is that the appearance of i 1 in a transaction t induces that neither i 2 nor i 3 is likely to appear also in t  A record that contains i 1 and i 2  but not i 3  does not support this rule It was 1 In this paper we abbreviate X  Y to XY for itemsets X Y of I  shown in  that the s upport o f itemsets i n I  and hence also support and condence of negative ARs under Denition II can be deduced from that of itemsets in I  Unlike Denition I this denition allows pruning based on the downward closure property of supp  and hence is easier to interpret and to implement Unfortunately the total number of possible rules has now grown to 5 m  2\(3 m   which is much more than under Denition I it can also be calculated that the sum of support for all possible rules is 3 m  2 m 1 1  which means that the average support equals 0 when m is large enough Practically these observations make the use of Denition II under the classical support-condence framework reasonable only in relatively small databases III R ELATED W ORK Based on the previous discussion two important and closely intertwined problems should be solved in negative AR mining that is to keep the number of discovered rules in check and to nd efcient algorithms To reduce the search space and to improve the quality of the mined rules it is fruitful to introduce additional measures apart from support and condence Most papers consider some kind of correlation between attributes For instance Brin et al u sed  2 tests to detect item dependencies within an itemset An efcient algorithm for nding correlated itemsets ensued from the upward closure of the  2 statistic if an itemset X is correlated i.e contains dependencies then so is every superset of X  and this information may be used for nding negative ARs under Denition II In a similar vein Aggarwal and Yu e v a luated correlations in itemsets by a measure they called collective strength and provided an efcient algorithm to identify socalled strongly collective itemsets from databases leading to negative ARs under Denition I Some disadvantages of these approaches are that a they are not in line with i.e cannot be put on top of the support-condence framework and b afterwards additional operations are still needed to determine the exact form of negative rules On another count heuristic methods  like the ones proposed by Savasere et al and Yuan et al incorporate domain kno wledge usually a taxonomy into the algorithms and only part of the rules are focused on to reduce the scale of the problem In these methods expected support or condence of an itemset based on itemsets positions in the taxonomy is compared to the actual value of these measures and the larger the deviation the more interesting such itemsets are considered to be While they may reveal interesting negative ARs domain knowledge may often not be readily available limiting the applicability of such approaches On the other hand Apriori-based implementations are very attractive since they can guarantee efciency for large scale databases do not depend on other algorithms and do not require additional information on the data For example Wu et al presented an Apriori-based frame w o rk for m ining both positive and negative ARs in the sense of Denition I that focuses on rule dependency measures rather than on itemset dependency measures and in particular uses Piatetsky 


Shapiroís argument that arule X  Y is not interesting if supp  X  Y   supp  X  supp  Y   For instance for the rule X  Y to be valid the authors in  r equired interest  X  Y   supp  X  Y   supp  X  supp   Y   mi  with mi an additional threshold Furthermore X  Y is only considered a valid negative AR if both X and Y are frequent Apart from being intuitive to be relevant mined patterns should involve frequent itemsets only this criterion also warrants a signicant efciency boost if X is infrequent then no negative ARs with X or any of its supersets in the antecedent or consequent have to be considered There are however substantial problems with this approach since the algorithm proposed in cannot generate a ll v a lid ne g a ti v e ARs Without going into the details here the problem is due to the fact that interest  which is used during algorithm execution for pruning itemsets does not have a downward closure property like supp  Another Apriori-based algorithm was given by Antonie and Za  ane f or the purpose o f s imultaneously generating positive ARs and a subclass of negative ARs under Denition II using Pearson correlation coefcient for measuring interestingness Their approach suffers from a similar problem like the one proposed in IV E FFICIENT D ISCOVERY OF B OTH P OSITIVE AND N EGATIVE A SSOCIATION R ULES The above-described Apriori-based implementations are efcient but cannot generate all valid positive and negative ARs In this section we try to solve that problem without paying too high a price in terms of computational costs In accordance with the observations made in Section II-B we work with negative ARs under Denition I For simplicity we also limit ourselves to support and condence to determine the validity of ARs A Valid Positive and Negative Association Rules By a valid AR we mean any expression C 1  C 2  C 1 012  X  X   C 2 012 Y  Y   X Y I  X  Y    s.t 1 supp  C 1  C 2   ms 2 supp  X   ms supp  Y   ms 3 conf  C 1  C 2   mc 4 C 1  C 2 is minimal w.r.t support of its negative itemsets In 1 it is possible to replace ms by another value support threshold for negative ARs e.g based on the density of D  but this is not necessary in general a larger threshold yields more signicant and hence more interesting negative rules Condition 2 is based on the work of Wu et al  see Section III The distinguishing part of this denition is condition 4 it means that if C 1   X  then there should not exist X   X such that supp   X   C 2   ms analogously for C 2  This condition is based on the upward closure property of supp for negative itemsets from Section II-B it is reasonable to consider only the boundary of negative ARs with minimal negative parts since clearly the non-negative ARs are redundant Like the downward closure property for positive itemsets it will be used as an efcient pruning device in our algorithm Our algorithm for mining both positive and negative valid ARs PNAR is built up conceptually around a partition of the itemset space into 4 parts which is shown in Fig 1 Each part is then dealt with separately Before spelling out the steps of the algorithm we introduce the relevant notations B Notations X Y  positive itemsets I,I   itemsets which can be positive or negative L  P i   frequent itemsets in Part i  L  P i  k  k length frequent itemsets in Part i  L  P 4  k,p  in Part 4 frequent

mining and can be implemented by Apriori but also by other algorithms like Frequent-Pattern Tree Close  9 C harm  18 The supports in Line 2 can be immediately derived after we get all frequent positive itemsets since supp   I   supp  I  for I in I  For line 3 and line 4 we can easily calculate the support of an itemset  XY or  X  Y X  Y  in Part 3 and Part 4 if we know the support of X Y and XY  Since antecedent and consequent of a negative rule must be frequent by our denition for all such potential valid negative ARs supp  X  and supp  Y  are known The computational efciency of the algorithm depends highly on the number of itemsets I  XY that need further checking via database scan In the following two subroutines the upward closure property of supp is used to reduce that number D Generating Frequent Itemsets in P 3 1 L  P 3  C  P 3  S  P 3  2 C  P 3  2   i 1  i 2  i 1 i 2 012 L  P 1  1 i 1   i 2  3 for  k 2 C  P 3  k   k   do 4 for all I   X  Y 012 C  P 3  k do 5 if

The corresponding t-values show the level of significance using the magnitude of the standardized parameter estimates between constructs. The path coefficients in the research model are significant as shown in Figure 2  The explanatory power of the R≤ is classified by Chin bs t a n t i a l e x pres s i v en e s s f o r t h e  research model could be estimated by an R≤ over 0.67. An average effect stands for R≤-values between 0.67 and 0.34. The explanatory power is weak for an R≤ between 0.34 and 0.19 and overall not relevant for R≤-values under 0.19 [1    Figure 2: Structural model validation   Therefore R≤ of our research model for the intention to use self- and e-assessment can be categorized as substantial expressive for perceived usefulness and as an average effect for intention  4.4. Results  The results of our empirical research based on our explorative case study is that the intention to use self and e-assessments can be explained by Davis perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use Furthermore antecedents of perceived usefulness are perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings derived of the MATH e ll as th e [36]. Statistical  support can be provided for all the hypothesized relations between constructs except of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness  5. Limitations  As with any work in a new field of research relevant literature about self- and e-assessments to build on is almost nonexistent. Unfortunately the operationalization of "perceived cost and time savings" as well as perceived quality improvements  in this paper could consequently not build on earlier work too much so we had to derive them of the MATH m  w e ll as t h e UT A U T  36   As with any empirical field study, this work has limitations. It is important to note that we have build an explorative model to examine the acceptance of self- and e-assessments.

on the intention to use self- and e-assessment center as well as the influence of PQI, PCS and PTS on PU it might represent a single example for a specific economy, country or cultural region . There might be differences for the intention of different informnation systems with different settings. Future research should discuss this issue more detailed  Furthermore our questionnaire was just answered by large-scale corporations in Germany. So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
