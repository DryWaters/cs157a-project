Learning Performance Assessment Approach Using Learning Portfolio for E-learning Systems Chih-Ming Chen & Yi-Yun Chen National Hualien Teachers College, Taiwan 970, R.O.C E-mail: cmchen@mail.nhltc.edu.tw Abstract Learning performance assessment aims to evaluate what learners learnt during the learning process. In recent years, how to perform the learning performance assessment is a critical issue in the web-based learning field. The traditional summative evaluation can be applied to evaluate the learning performance both for the conventional classroom learning and web-based learning. However, it only 
considers final learning outcomes without considering the learning progress of learners. This paper proposes a learning performance assessment approach which combines four computational intelligence theories including grey relational analysis, K-means clustering method, fuzzy association rule mining and fuzzy inference to perform this task based on the learning portfolio of individual learner. Experimental results indicate that the evaluation result of proposed method is positive relevance with those of summative assessment Namely, this method can help teachers to precisely perform the formative assessment for individual 
learner utilizing only the learning portfolio in web-based learning environment 1 Introduction GagnÈsê research on the internal process of learning indicated that the complete learning process cannot occur without learning performance assessment   Th e learning per f o r m an c e evalu ati o n i n s t r u m e n t s  could be classified as the summative assessment and formative assessment. The summative evaluation is performed after finishing an instruction unit or class but the formative assessment emphasizes the learning process Recently, the popular formative assessment 
instrument utilizes the learning portfolio for learning performance assessment. The learning portfolio can be gathered when people learn in an e-learning system Carrieiraês study proposed to m o n ito r  the u s er s  reading behaviors in order to infer their interest in particular articles. The information of the learning process is quite impossible to be completely gathered by the traditional written examination method. Hence Rahkilaês study s e d th e id ea of u s ing the user  profiles with log data for the learning performance assessment Knowledge discovery, whose objective is to 
obtain useful knowledge from data stored in large repositories. Data mining has been considered as an appropriate method of knowledge discovery to excavate the implicit information. In this study, the proposed learning performance assessment approach integrates four computational intelligence techniques to evaluate the on-line learning behaviors. They include the grey relational analysis [4  m ean s  clustering algorithm u zz y a ssoci ation r u le [7 8  and fuzzy inference [9  T h e f o ur co m p ut ati o n a l  intelligence techniques are employed to perform the 
factor analysis for extracting the main factors of effecting the learning performance, determine fuzzy membership functions for the fuzzy association rule discover the fuzzy association rules related to the learning performance assessment, and infer the learning performance by the discovered fuzzy association rules, respectively The proposed learning performance assessment approach has been demonstrated its effectiveness for the personalized e-learning system presented in our previous study m e nta l r e sul ts show the  proposed learning assessment approach can correctly 
evaluate learnersê learning performance according to their learning portfolios as well as help teachers to save a lot of time for learning evaluation during learning processes 2 Problem description 2.1.

the integration of çwhat people learnedé and çhow people learnedé. The formative assessment occurs when teachers feed information back to students in ways that enable the student to learn better, or when students can engage in a self-reflective process Hence, to grade the learning performance based on the learning portfolio contains learnersê learning processes on e-learning platforms.

Flowchart of learning performance assessment Figure 1 reveals the entire flowchart of the proposed learning performance assessment approach In the beginning, the grey relational analysis is first applied to perform learning factor analysis, and then K-means clustering algorithm is employed to logically determine fuzzy membership function based on data distribution for discovering fuzzy association rules. After the fuzzy rules for learning performance assessment are discovered, the fuzzy inference is used to grade learning performance for learners. The following sections will give details for the proposed learning performance assessment approach 3.2. Learning factor analysis using the grey relational analysis Learning factor analysis is a vital process for the proposed learning performance assessment approach because it can filter out the irrelevant factors with the learning performance from the learning portfolio to promote the efficiency of learning evaluation Professor Deng Julong proposed the grey relational analysis \(GRA\ can rank the relational degree for numerous sub-factors with the main factor according to the grey relational grade [4  5 Th e  importance of single data sequence could be explored by the grey relational grade. The mathematics model of grey relational analysis is described as the following steps Step 1: Determining the referred and comparative sequences To employ GRA for factor analysis, the prior step is the referred sequence 0 I and comparative sequence i I must be first determined. Grey relational grade will be a large value if both the referred sequence and comparative sequence mutually resemble in the geometric curve. The notations for the referred sequence 0 I and comparative sequence i I can be respectively represented as follows      2   1      2   1   0 0 0 0 k I I I I k I I I I i i i i 1 where 0 I  represents the referred sequence i I is the comparative sequence, and Z k   Step 2: Grey generation Before continuing the GRA, the comparability among data sequences should be satisfied. Otherwise data sequences must be transformed through the grey generation. To satisfy the comparability, the larger-the-better transformation ad o p ted an d  formulated as follows    min   max   min      0   0   0   0   k I k I k I k I k I i i i i i     2 where   max  0  k I i denotes the maximum value of the original sequence    0  k I i represents the th k  data of the original sequence i and    k I i is the generated sequence Step 3: Calculating the grey relational grade Let  I  I  i 0  denote the evaluation value of grey relational grade between the data sequence 0 I and i I then the mathematical formula of the grey relational grade can be formulated as follows   n k i i  k  I  k  I  n  I  I  1 0 0 1    3 where max max min 0                  k k I k I oi i      max max max k I k I i o k i       Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies \(ICALTê05 0-7695-2338-2/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

The flowchart of learning performance assessment 3.3. Determining fuzzy membership function for fuzzy association rule mining In this study, the fuzzy association rule is employed to explore the fuzzy knowledge rules from the learning portfolio for learning performance assessment. Generally, the fuzzy association rule only considers so-called large itemsets for fuzzy association rule mining. In order to find out the large itemsets for the fuzzy association rule mining, the transaction data with quantitative value must be first transformed into fuzzy degrees. To logically determine fuzzy membership functions, the K-means clustering algorithm  is a ppl ie d t o a u t o m a tica ll y  determine the centers of triangle fuzzy membership functions for the fuzzy association rule mining herein 3.4. Fuzzy association rule mining Let I be a set of items and T be a set of transactions with items in I Association rules is regarded as a method of data mining to clarify large itemsets and presented as the form Y X where       Y X  Y  X  I Y  X The rule Y X  Boolean association rule, means that most part of transaction set of T that simultaneously contains both the X item and Y item [6  In co ntrast with  Boolean association rules, Hongês study [8 osed  the fuzzy association rule to overcome the defect in the Boolean association rule for handling the quantative transaction data. In a fuzzy association rule Y X where X and Y are linguistic terms. To judge a fuzzy association rule whether is strong or not, two conditions must be deliberated First, the support and confidence respectively have to satisfy the threshold, i.e. minimum support and minimum confidence Sec ond th e certain ty f acto r  is used to evaluate the dependency between antecedent and consequent [7  T o di s c o v er th e f u zzy  knowledge rules related to the learning performance from learning portfolio, the fuzzy association rule presented in  is e m p l o y ed to per f o r m thi s  tas k  herein 3.5. Fuzzy inference for learning performance assessment This section describes how to infer the learning performance according to the discovered fuzzy association rules by fuzzy inference process. The discovered fuzzy production rules have the form of IF-THEN rules shown as follows B Y THEN A X and A X IF    2 2 1 1 where i X and Y are linguistic variables i A and B are linguistic terms A defuzzification strategy aims to transform the outcome of fuzzy inference into crisp value. The center of gravity \(COG\ [9 whi ch i s one  m e th od  o f  defuzzification methods, computes the crisp value COG Z from the most typical values and respective degrees of membership function. Therefore, the defuzzification method of center of gravity is used to obtain the crisp value of learnerês learning performance, and the mathematical formula is shown as follows    n j j z n j j j z COG z z z z 1 1       4 where n  is the number of quantization levels of the output j z is the amount of conttrol output at the quantization level j and   j z z  represents its membership value in the output fuzzy set Z  4 Experiments T o verify the quality of the discovered fuzzy association rules for the learner performance assessment, some university students who have majored in the course of C language programming were invited to test this system. The experimental results are described as follows 4.1. The learning portfolio gathered by PELS In our experiment, six learning factors listed in Table 1, which is supposed to be relevant with the Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies \(ICALTê05 0-7695-2338-2/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

Herein, the learning factor G is regarded as referred sequence 0 I and the other learning factors  RA, DD, UD, LA, RT are comparative sequences i I  Table 2 illustrates a partial learning portfolio in the user profile database gathered by PELS Table 2.

Learning factor analysis Table 3 illustrates the grey relational grades between the referred sequence with various comparative sequences. To observe the results, we find that the five considered learning factors are highly relevant with the final testing score due to the grey relational grades are over the threshold 0.5. Thus the five learning factors will be preserved to perform the fuzzy association rule mining in order to discover useful fuzzy rules for learning performance assessment Table 3.

Fuzzy membership function determined by K-means clustering algorithm Since those quantitative transactions listed in Table 2 must be transferred into fuzzy transactions for fuzzy association rule mining, the K-means clustering algorithm is employed to perform clustering task and further logically determine the optimal membership function. After performing the clustering procedure, each learning factor can be clustered as appropriate groups according to its data distribution. Figure 2 shows an example of fuzzy membership function automatically determined by K-means clustering algorithm for the learning factor G  0 I L g   2 c 3 c 4 c 1 c 5 c Figure 2. The fuzzy membership function determined by K-means clustering algorithm for the learning factor G 4.4. The discovered fuzzy rules for learning performance assessment To explain the discovered fuzzy association rules for learning performance assessment, the simplified representation notations of the linguistic variables are listed in Tables 4. Table 5 illustrates the fuzzy rules discovered by the proposed learning performance assessment approach that can evaluate learnersê learning performance for learners with high testing score. To judge the discovered fuzzy rules whether is strong or not, two conditions that include the minimum support and minimum confidence are first deliberated. Besides, to ensure that the discovered rules are interesting and accurate, the certainty factor is further employed to identify the discovered fuzzy rules in this study  Table 6 lists the assigned threshold for fuzzy association rule mining task. From the discovered fuzzy rules listed in Table 5, we find that rule 1 has negative value of certainty factor. Therefore, we filter out this rule to obtain the verified fuzzy rules listed in Table 7 for learners with high testing score 4.5. Learning performance assessment by fuzzy inference In this section, we give an example of learning portfolio listed in Table 8 to demonstrate whether the discovered fuzzy rules can correctly evaluate the learning performance based on learning portfolio or not. Table 8 shows the grade of the final test of the learner with STUD. No. 11373 is 50. Next, the discovered fuzzy rules listed in Table 7 are applied to infer the grade of the final test for the learner with STUD. No. 11373 according to the learning factors RA, DD, UD, LA, and RT. The fuzzy inference process and the defuzzification method of center of gravity are used to evaluate the learning performance for the learner with STUD.

In another word, the proposed method can help teachers to precisely perform the formative assessment for individual learner under only utilizing the learning portfolio in web-based learning environment 5 Conclusion In this study, an effective learning performance assessment approach is presented to help teacher to precisely perform formative assessment for individual learner under only utilizing the learning portfolio in web-based learning environment. The inferred learning performance can be served as a reference guide to teachers as well as be regarded as a learning feedback to learners. By such a feedback mechanism, learners can understand his current learning status and make appropriate learning adjustment. Meanwhile, teachers could devote themselves to teaching work due to saving a lot of time for learning evaluation Table 4.

rule mining can be used to overcome these disadvantages  7. Conclusions  This paper, discusses the application of data mining techniques within Web documents to discover what users want. It introduces the concept of decision patterns in order to interpret decision rules in terms of association mining. It has proved that any decision pattern is a closed pattern. It also presents a new concept of rough association rules to improve of the quality of text mining. To compare with the traditional association mining, the rough association rules include more specific information and can be updated dynamically to produce more effective results The distinct advantage of rough association rules is that they can take away some uncertainties from discovered knowledge through updating supports and weight distributions of association rules. It also demonstrates that the proposed approach gains a better performance on both precision and recall, and it is a considerable alternative of association rule mining This research is significant since it takes one more step further to the development of data mining techniques for Web mining  References   M.

With interpretation I1 we mine closed frequent itemsets and then we remove those ones which do not satisfy the CAM constraint: this way we lose the whole information contained in those equivalence classes cut by the CAM constraint. On the other hand, according to interpretation I2, we mine the set of itemsets which satisfy the CAM constraint and then we compute the closure of such itemsets collection: thus, by de?nition, the itemsets bd and cd are solutions because they satisfy CAM and they have not a superset in the result set with the same support and satisfying the constraint Which one of the two di?erent interpretations is the most reasonable? It is straightforward to see that interpretation I1 is not a condensed representation since it loses a lot of information. In extreme cases it could output an empty solutions set even if there are many frequent itemsets which satisfy the given set of user-de?ned constraints. On the other hand, interpretation I2, which corresponds to the de?nition Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM representation of FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM Observe that I2 is a superset of I1: it contains all 


Observe that I2 is a superset of I1: it contains all closed itemsets which are under the CAM border \(as I1 plus those itemsets which arise in equivalence classes which are cut by the CAM border \(such as for instance ce and cde in Figure 3\(a Proposition 3 Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq ?

This could be an alternative. However since closed itemsets provide a much more meaningful set of association rules, we consider a good tradeo? among performance, conciseness and meaningfulness the use of Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq?CM resentation Finally, if we use free sets instead of closed, we only shift the problem leading to a symmetric situation. Using free sets interpretations I1 and I2 coincide when dealing with anti-monotone constraints because minimal elements are not cut o? by the constraint \(e.g. de in Fig. 3\(a constraints \(e.g. no free solution itemsets in Fig. 3\(b Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 4. Algorithms In this Section we study algorithms for the computation of MP5. We ?rst discuss separately how monotone and anti-monotone constraints can be pushed in the computation, then we show how they can be exploited together by introducing the CCIMiner algorithm 4.1. Pushing Monotone Constraints Pushing CAM constraints deep into the frequent itemset mining algorithm \(attacking the problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM  since they behave exactly as Cfreq . The case is di?erent for CM constraints, since they behave exactly the opposite of frequency. Indeed, CAM constraints can be used to e?ectively prune the search space to a small downward closed collection, while the upward closed collection of the search space satisfying the CM constraints cannot be exploited at the same time. This tradeo? holding on the search space of the computational problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CM extensively studied [18, 9, 4], but all these studies have failed to ?nd the real synergy of these two opposite types of constraints, until the recent proposal of ExAnte [6]. In that work it has been shown that a real synergy of the two opposites exists and can be exploited by reasoning on both the itemset search space and the transactions input database 


set search space and the transactions input database together According to this approach each transaction can be analyzed to understand whether it can support any solution itemset, and if it is not the case, it can be pruned In this way we prune the dataset, and we get the fruitful side e?ect to lower the support of many useless itemsets, that in this way will be pruned because of the frequency constraint, strongly reducing the search space. Such approach is performed with two successive reductions  reduction \(based on monotonicity reduction \(based on anti-monotonicity to  reduction we can delete transactions which do not satisfy CM , in fact no subset of such transactions satis?es CM and therefore such transactions cannot support any solution itemsets. After such reduction, a singleton item may happen to become infrequent in the pruned dataset, an thus it can be deleted by the ?reductions. Of course, these two step can be repeated until a ?xed point is reached, i.e. no more pruning is possible. This simple yet very e?ective idea has been generalized in an Apriori-like breadth-?rst computation in ExAMiner [5], and in a FP-growth [10] based depth-?rst computation in FP-Bonsai [7 Since in general depth-?rst approaches are much more e?cient when mining closed itemsets, and since FP-Bonsai has proven to be more e?cient than ExAMiner, we decide here to use a FP-growth based depth?rst strategy for the mining problem MP5. Thus we combine Closet [16], which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining closed frequent itemset, with FPBonsai, which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining frequent itemset with CM constraints 4.2. Pushing Anti-monotone Constraints Anti-monotone constraints CAM can be easily pushed in a Closet computation by using them in the exact same way as the frequency constraint, exploiting the downward closure property of antimonotone constraints. During the computation, as soon as a closed itemset X s.t  CAM \(X ered, we can prune X and all its supersets by halting the depth ?rst visit. But whenever, such closed itemset X s.t  CAM \(X e.g. bcd in Figure 3\(a some itemsets Y ? X belonging to the same equivalence class and satisfying the constraint may exist \(e.g bd and cd in Figure 3\(a ery such X in a separate list, named Edge, and after the mining we can reconstruct such itemsets Y by means of a simple top-down process, named Backward-Mining, described in Algorithm 1 Algorithm 1 Backward-Mining Input: Edge, C, CAM , CM C is the set of frequent closed itemsets CAM is the antimonotone constraint CM is a monotone constraint \(if present Output: MP5 1: MP5 = C split Edge by cardinality 2: k = 0 3: for all c ?

Closed Constrained Itemsets Miner The two techniques which have been discussed above are independent.

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00 © 2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
