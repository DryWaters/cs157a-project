Study on Application of Apriori Algorithm in Data Mining  Yanxi Liu School of Science 002 Changchun University,China130022 liuyx.ccu@163.com  Abst ract with the rapid de velopment of networks and information technology, the endless information has paid more and more attention by people. While in the pursuit of information with high speed, the analysis and mining of the information and rules hidden deep in the data are also paid more emphasis. Data mining technology is to organize and analyze the data, which can extract and discover knowledge from the mass of data, so how to apply the data mining technology into enterprise stock management is the focus of this topic studied. In this paper, combining with data mining theory, Apriori algorithm in association rule mining algorithm is described in detail, the algorithm implementation process is illustrated, and the improved methods of the algorithm are discussed   Keywords-data mining; information extraction; Apriori algorithm  I  I NT RODUCTION  Although modern computer technology and database technology have been developed rapidly, could support the store and quickly retrieve the grand scale databases or 
data warehouses, but these techniques was only to gather these "massive" data, and not to effectively organize and use the knowledge hidden them, which eventually led to today s phenomenon of "rich data, poor knowledge". The emergence of data mining technology met people needs The technology involved in artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistical analysis and other technologies, and it makes decision analysis into a new stage. In this paper the association rule mining algorithm Apriori algorithm which is common ly us ed in data mining is mainly  discussed II  A P RIORI ALGORITHM SUMMARY  Apriori algorithm is one of the most influential algorithms to mine the frequent item sets of Boolean association rules. This algorithm is an approach based on two-stage frequency, the design of association rule mining algorithm can be decomposed into two sub-issues     1\ Find all the item sets with the support greater than the minimum support, which is called frequent item 2\ Based on the above obtained frequent set, all the association rules will be generated, and for each frequent item set A, all the nonempty subset a of A will be found, if the ratio of sup port \(A\/ sup port\(a 
000 min confidence to generate the association rules A-a. That is, from the frequent sets obtained in the first step, to exploit the rules with confidence not less than minimum confidence minconfidence the user specified   The realization process of the algorithm can be described as follows: First of all, Apriori algorithm solve the frequent sets L with items of 1, then from L to generate the candidate sets Cz with items of 2, scan the transaction database D, calculate the support to solve Lz and so on, resulting in CK, to scan D and derive LK. Once frequently set generated from the database, strong association rules can be directly generated. The core algorithm as follows      Apriori algorithm called two sub-processes which are Apriori-gen\(\ and subset\(\, Apriori-gen\(\ process produces a candidate, then use the Apriori property \(all non-empty subsets of frequent item sets must also be frequent\ to delete those candidates of the non-frequent subsets. Once generated all of the candidates, we will scan the database D, and for each transaction, use the Subset \(\ sub procedure to identify all the candidate subsets, and make cumulative count for each of these candidates. Finally, all 
candidates met the minimum support form frequent item set L  III  A P RIORI ALGORITHM ILLUST RATION   Here by way of exa mp le to illus trate the Apriori algorithm implementation process A 001  Generate frequent item sets For example, a transaction database as shown in table 1, in which there are nine affairs, that is, |D|=9.

As the figure shows candidate 1-itemset C1 is an aggregation {{I1}, {I2 I3}, {I4}, {I5}} which is consisted of each item set. For each item in the C1, scanning the transaction database and calculate its support count. And then it will be compared with the minimum support count 2, to determine whether the frequency, the item greater than the minimum support count will be added to the frequent 1-itemset to determine frequent 1-itemset L1 3  To find frequent 2-itemsets L2. We should connect frequent 1-itemsets L1 to generate aggregation C2 of candidate 2-itemsets  C2 L1 000 L1={{I1,I2},{I1,I3},{I1,I4},{I1,I5},{I2,I4 I2,I5},{I3,I4},{I3,I5},{I4,I5 As all the 1-ite ms ets of the 2-ite ms ets in C2 are  included, so it is not need to delete. For each item in the C2, scanning the transaction database and calculate its support count. And then it will be compared with the minimum support count 2, to determine whether the frequency, same as step 2, to determine frequent 2-itemset L2 4  To find frequent 3-itemsets L3  Same as step 3, it is to use L2 to generate aggregation C3 of candidate 3-itemsets C3 L2 000 L2={{I1,I2,I3},{I1,I2,I5},{I1,I3,I5},{I2,I3,I4 I2,I3,I5},{I2,I3,I5},{I2,I3,I5 Item set {I1, I3, I5} has a 2-ite m subset {I3, I5} which  is not a L2 element, thus it is not frequent, from C3 to remove {I1, I3, I5}, empathy delete{I2,I3,I4}, {I2,I3,I5  I2,I4,I5}. Thus C3= {{I1, I2, I3}, {I1, I2, I5}}. For each item in the C3, scanning the transaction database and calculate its support count. And then it will be compared with the minimum support count 2, to determine whether the frequency, and to determine frequent 3-itemset L3 5  To find frequent 4-itemsets L4  Using L3 to generate aggregation C4 of candidate 4-itemsets and C4 = L3 000 L3= {{I1, I2, I3, I5}}. The 3-s ubs et {I2, I3, I5} of ite m s et {I1, I2, I3, I5} does not belong to L3, thus {I1, I2, I3, I5} will be removed  Therefore, C4 000 the algorithm is ended and all the frequent item sets are found  B 001  Generate association rules from frequent item sets Once the frequent item sets found from the transaction database, the next step is to generate association rules from them. That is, to produce strong association rules to meet the minimum support and minimum confidence, and the confidence of the obtained association rules can be calculated by using the following formula. Here the conditional probab ility is calculated by us ing the support for ite m sets        100 sup    sup   100 XY x confidence X Y port X Y port X 000G\000G 000 000Ÿ\000 000u 000 \000 000u In which sup port\(X 000 Y\ is the affair number w hic h contains item set X 000 Y; sup port\(X\ is the affair number which contains item set X; based on the above formula, the operation of forming the association rules as follow s  1  For each frequent item set 1, generate all non-empty subsets of it  2  For each non-empty subset of 1 if sup   min sup   port l confidenc e port s 000t then to generate association rule s 000 ls Here minconfidence is the minimum confidence threshold  As the rules are directly generated through frequent item sets, so all the item sets the association rules involved have to meet the minimum support threshold   With the above data as an example, the generation process of association rules will be illustrated. The frequent item set l= {I1, I2, I5}. The following will give the association rules generated according to 1. The non-empty subsets of I are {I1, I2}, {II, IS}, {I2, I5 I1}, {I2}, {I5}. The following are the association rules and their confidence obtained according to this   1\ Il 000 I2 000 I5     confidence=2/4=50  2 000 I5 000 12   confidence=2/2=100 3\12 000 I5 000 I1    confidence=2/2=100 4 000 Il 000 I5    confidence=2/6=33.3  5 000 12 000 I5    confidence=2/7=28.6 6\I5 000 I1 000 I2     confidence=2/2=100

If the threshold of the minimum confidence is 70 then there are only rule 2\, \(3\ and \(6\, because their confidence is greater than the minimum confidence threshold, so they are retained as the final output. That is output rules: Il 000 I2 000 I5, 12 000 I5 000 I1, I5 000 I1 000 I2 IV  A P RI ORI AL GORIT HM E VAL UAT I ON  Apriori algorithm is to gradually complete the frequent item set discovery through a growing number of the item elements. Firstly, to generate frequent 1-itemset L1, and then frequent 2-itemset L2, until no longer able to expand the number of frequent item set elements, the algorithm is ended. In the first k-cycle, the process firstly generates the collection of Ck of the candidate k-item, and then generates support through scanning the database and tests to generate frequent k-item Lk. Algorithm is simple and clear, has no complicated derivation, and is complicated derivation, but there are some shortcomings difficult to overcome 1  Repeatedly scanning the transaction database. For each element of each circular candidate set C*, it must be verified whether to join the frequent item set Lk through scanning the database. If there is a large frequent item set contained 10 items, then it is need to scan the transaction database at least 10 times, which will bring a great I/O load 2  It may generate a large candidate set, from Lk-1 to generate k- candidate item set, and Ck is the exponential growth, for example, 104 frequent 1-itemsets may are likely to generate candidate 2-itemset with close 107 elements. Such a large candidate set is a challenge to time and main memory space  3  Adopting only support. In real life, the occurrences of some affairs are very frequent, but some are very rare so for our mining there has a problem: If the minimum support threshold set too high, although the pace has accelerated, but the data covered is less, meaningful rules may not be discovered; If the minimum support threshold set too low, then a large number of rules without practical meaning will flood the entire mining process which will greatly reduce the mining efficiency and the availability of the rule. All this will mislead decision mak ing 4  The fitness landscape of the algorithm is narrow The algorithm only considers a single Boolean association rule mining, but in practical applications there might be multi-dimensional, multi-volume, and multi-layer association rules. At this time, the algorithm is no longer applicable, needs to improve, or even needs to be re-designed  In order to improve the efficiency of Apriori algorithm, there are a series of improved algorithms Although these algorithms follow the above theory, but because of the introduction of related technologies \(such as data partition s ampling, etc.\, the adaptability and efficiency of the Apriori algorithm is improved to a certain extent 1  Method based on data partition  The application of data partition technology in association rule mining can improve the flexibility of the association rule mining in large-capacity data set. Its basic idea is firs t of all, the large-capacity databas es will be logically divided into several disjoint blocks which are used to generate locally frequent item sets, and then these local frequent item sets are regarded as candidate global frequent item sets to get the final global frequent item sets through testing their support  2  Method based on Hash  A hash-based technology can be used to compress the candidate k-item set Ck \(k>1\. For example, when scanning each transaction in database to hash them \(that is map\ to the different barrels of the different barrels and increase the corresponding table count. In the hash table the 2-itemset with corresponding hash bucket count less than the value of support must not be a frequent 2-itemset should be removed from the candidate item sets. This hash-based technology can greatly compressed the k-item s et to be exa mined      3  Method based on transaction compression Reducing the affairs needed to be scanned in latter circle, thus one affair does not contain any frequent k-item set can not contain any frequent \(k+l\ - item set Therefore, when this record appears, you can add a mark to it or remove from the transaction database. Therefore the database scans to generate j-item set \(j>k\ would obviate the need to scan and analyze these records       4  Method based on sampling This method is to select a random sample S of given database D, and then search frequent item sets in the S rather than D. This approach sacrifices some accuracy, but in exchange for the effectiveness  This method only needs to scan S affairs for one time As the search in S instead of D, it may lose some global frequent item s ets To reduce this poss ibility the s upport less than the minimum support can be used to find out the frequent item s ets LS\ locally in S, and then the res t of the database will be used to calculate the actual support of each item set in LS   5  Dynamic item set count  Dynamic item set count technology divides the database into blocks which will mark the starting point Unlike Apriori only identify new candidate before each time of complete scan, in this deformation, new candidate item set can be added at any start point. If all subsets of a key set have been identified as frequently, it will be added as a new candidate. The result algorithm needs fewer database scans than Apriori V  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, C# language and a powerful class library Net framework provided are used to achieve the development and application of the Apriori association rule mining algorithm. The algorithm is theoretically studied in-depth, the advantages and disadvantages of it are also pointed out, and finally its improvement methods are discussed  R EFERENCES  1  Savasere, E.Omiecinski, and S.Navathe, An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases, Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Very large Database

6 D. Steps in the Algorithm 1 partition 1 Example: Let D be a sample database given in the Fig.1 and the utility table correspondingly to the sample database is given in Table 1. The input database is partitioned in three partition P1,P2 and P3 by means of month granularity time period. Assume min_FTUsupport = 82 and minconf =  1. From the partition P1, all  possible candidate 2-itemsets such as :{\(1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5 1,6 2,3 2,4 2,4 2,5 2,6 3,4 3,5 3,6 4,5 4,6 5,6            2 Example: Consider a two-itemset {2,3}. External utility of items {2} and {3} in partition  P 1  are 10 and 8 which are obtained from the utility table. The internal utility value of items are obtained by  computing Iu\( {2},Tq Tq ? P1  Iu\( {3},Tq Tq ? P1 respectively. Then, the utility value of an itemset {2,3} is U\(2,3 12*10 16*8 2,3} is  f  \( { 2, 3 } , P1 support of itemset {2,3} is  FTUsupport\(2,3 2*248  Figure 1.

itemset The same procedure is repeated for all other candidate 2itemsets. Finally the itemsets whose  FTU support  values falling below  min_FTUsupport    are removed and the selected itemsets are considered as FTU 2-itemsets of partition 1 TABLE I.  UTILITY TABLE         3 mining of FTU 2-itemsets \(P1 + P2  Example: The partition P2 is taken into account and the candidate 2-itemsets in partition P2  are generated. For each candidate 2-itemsets, FTUsupport values are computed based on the procedure described in the previous step. In addition, the candidate 2-itemsets that are satisfying min_FTUsupport  in the previous step may or may not be a FTU 2-itemsets in a current partition P2. It is identified by jointly computing its occurrence frequency value and also its utility values in partition P1 + P2 Then, the candidate 2-itemsets whose FTUsupport values greater than min_FTUsupport are selected as FTU 2-itemsets in both partitions P1 + P2 .The itemsets that are obtained from the previous partition to the current partition are called as  ?type  candidate itemsets and the newly generated candidate itemsets in the current partition P2 is called as ?-type candidate itemsets From the sample database, FTUsupport  of ?-type  itemset 2,3 FTUsupport for all itemsets in ?-type  and ?-type are calculated The itemsets are filtered based on the min_FTUsupport. From the sample database the itemsets {\(2,3 3,5 the next step 4 P1 + P2 +....+Pn Example : In this step the partition P 3 s considered and all 


FTU 2-itemsets are  computed based on the previous step. The above process is repeated until all the partition Pn is processed to mine only those FTU 2-itemsets. In step the itemsets 2,6 3,6 5 Example : In this step, the resultant FTU 2- itemsets are used for generating the candidate 1-itemsets. In our sample database, we have generated the candidate1-itemsets { 23,3 63,3,33,3,63,3} from FTU 2-itemsets  {\(2,6 3,6 redundant sub-itemset  \(63,3 candidate 1-itemsets as {23,3 , 63,3,33,3}. Then , FTUsupport values of these sub-itemsets are calculated by scanning the database. Here, the sub-itemset  33,3 is removed since its FTUsupport  is less than the min_FTUsupport value 6 K ? 2 Example: The FTU 3 itemsets are generated by combining the FTU 2itemsets in accordance with the time property. Then, the occurrence frequency and also the utility support values of the FTU 3-itesets are calculated by scanning the database. The generated candidate 3itemsets, whose FTU-support is greater than min_FTUsupport    are termed as FTU 3-itemsets. By using these procedures FTU K-itemsets K >3 In this example the candidate 3-itemset \(2,3,6 generated by combing the FTU 2-itemsets \(2,6 3,6 Then the corresponding FTUsupport value of candidate 3 itemsets are computed and also the FTU 3-itemsets are selected based on the  min_FTUsupport  value 7 Example : In this step, we have generated utility oriented temporal association rules using all FTU itemsets in the form of \( X ?

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The experimental results of the UTARM algorithm for mining of utility oriented temporal association rules are explained in this section.  The Proposed UTARM algorithm has been implemented using JAVA \(jdk 1.6 experimenting , we have used T10I4D100K dataset[15],which is widely accepted synthetic data generated using existing tools T10I4D100K : This dataset contains 100,000 transactions and 870 distinct items. T10I4100K denotes the average size of transactions\(T itemsets\(I D dataset should have number of partitions, which contain a set of transactions and every item presented should have quantity and profit. So, preprocessing is done, i.e., we divide the input database into partitions. For each partition we used a random number generator to generate random numbers, which mimic the quantity of an item sold for each transaction. Also, for each item in the partition, we have assigned random number that specifies the profit vale. From the database, we have partitions Items P1 P2 P3 1 2 3 4 5 6 4

The input database is given to the proposed algorithm for mining utility oriented association rules. For various support and confidence values, the rules are generated and the results are given in Table 3 and Fig.2 From the Table III we conclude that number of rules generated is proportional to the support and confidence values These two measures filters the number of rules generated as that of min_FTUsupport  and minconf plays  an important role for generating utility oriented temporal association rules TABLE III.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK We have presented an efficient algorithm for mining of utility oriented temporal association rule. The proposed work is extended from traditional ARM by incorporating the 


temporal and utility factor for mining significant association rules. The proposed algorithm mines FTU itemsets from the database using the support computed by utility along with time constraints and finally, the utility oriented temporal association rules are generated. The experimentation is carried out on publication database and the experimental results proved that the proposed algorithm effectively discovers the utility oriented temporal association rules. The above algorithm can be extended for incremental mining      REFERENCES 1] G Anil Rajput, Ramesh Prasad Aharwal, Nidhi Chandel, Devendra Singh Solanki, Ritu Soni, Approaches of Classification to Policy of Analysis of Medical Data, International Journal of Computer Science and Network security, Vol.9, No.11, November 2009 2]  J.
