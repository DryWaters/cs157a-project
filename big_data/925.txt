Because more than two users share the same time-frequency resources in MU-MIMO systems, there is a big problem for the receiver to cancel the interference of the other users. Inspired by the idea of interference cancellation in CDMA systems, a novel multi-user MIMO scheme is proposed in this paper. It employs spreading in the transmitter and joint detection SP-JD\n the receiver. Simulation results show that SP-JD scheme could achieve higher sum rates capacity and better bit error rate \(BER\erformance than Zero-Forcing \(ZF scheme while the receiver is not aware of the precoding vectors applied to the streams transmitted to the other users Keywords-spre ading and joint detection \(SP-JD\ultiuser MIMO; Block Diagonalization \(BD\; Per-User Unitary and Rate Control \(PU 2 RC\-Forcing \(ZF I   I NTRODUCTION  Multiple-input multiple output \(MIMO\ systems has been an attractive research field in recent years. It was shown that MIMO system can increase the channel capacity of the system significantly [1  2 Mo re re ce nt l y   attention has shifted to multiuser MIMO systems because they have the potential to combine the high capacity achievable with MIMO processing with the benefits of space-division multiple access \(SDMA However, in multi-user MIMO \(MU-MIMO\stem the inter-user interference is generated when the resources are allocated to multiple users. In order to avoid the interuser interference we can use dirty paper coding \(DPC\ [3  It was shown that the interference which is known a priori to the transmitter does not affect the channel capacity DPC is an optimal precoding method that achieves the channel capacity. However, it is not practical in real systems since its complexity is prohibitive In order to make it possible to apply MU-MIMO system to real systems, many suboptimal schemes were proposed by researchers. e.g. block diagonalization \(BD 4  Z e r o f o rc in g Z F    5  an d P e rUs er Un ita ry an d R a t e  Control \(PU 2 RC\6 BD looks for the null space of interference channels. It eliminates the interference among the selected users. Since each user’s precoding matrix must lie in the null space of all other users’ channels, the number of users that can be simultaneously supported with BD is limited by the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas [7  be cau s e th e n u m b er of  tr an s m it an ten n a s is  no smaller than the total number of receive antennas in the system Since both ZF and PU 2 RC are closed-loop MIMO schemes, user basically needs to feed back a list of information including preferred precoding index and its CQI to the Node B. Compared with ZF scheme, PU 2 RC has a drawback in scheduling the streams to the selected user subset, only the users with the same preferred precoding matrix can be a candidate for the scheduling resulting in decrease of multiuser diversity [8   On the other hand, although ZF scheme is designed such that the received signal is free from multiuser interference in theory. However, due to channel quantization and feedback delay, some multiuser interference will exist. So LMMSE receiver must be employed at the receiver to reduce the interference and improve system performance, but this requires that the precoding vectors applied to the streams transmitted to interference users are known. If the receiver is not aware of the precoding vectors applied to the streams transmitted to the other users, it is not able to reject the interference from the other users, and can only maximize the received power [9  B u t in  re al sy stem s th e re ce iv er is u s u a lly n o t  aware of other users’ precoding vectors. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-user MIMO scheme in which every user don’t need to aware of the precoding vectors applied to the streams transmitted to the others, but also achieve higher capacity and better bit error rate \(BER\erformance This paper is organized as follows: Section 003  describes the signal model used in the paper.

In order to resolve this problem, a novel multi-user MIMO scheme is proposed in this paper. It employs spreading in the transmitter and joint detection SP-JD\ in the receiver. The block diagram of SP-JD scheme for MU-MIMO system is illustrated in Figure 2  Figure 2  Block diagram of SP-JD scheme for MU-MIMO System In order to compare the system performance between SP-JD scheme and ZF scheme, each user only feeds back the index of precoding vector and the corresponding estimated CQI to Node B, and maximum sum capacity user-scheduling algorithm [11 is ap p l ie d t o f i n d th e u s er  subsets in SP-JD scheme.

Variable Spreading Factor \(OVSF\ [12 co de  i s us ed  a s t h e spreading code thanks to its characteristic of variable length. In order to decrease the loss of spectrum efficiency the length of OVSF code is as short as possible. In this paper, the length of OVSF code equal to the number of users in the user subsets, and here is S N So the orthogonal sequence can be expressed as      12  s kkk k N cc c  c 000  1  s kN  000 7 And the orthogonal sequences of OVSF code are listed in Figure 3    1 1 1 S k N    c   1 2 1 1 s k N    c   2 2 1 1 s k N    c   1 4 1 1,1,1 s k N    c   2 4 1,1 1 1 s k N    c   3 4 1 1 1 1 s k N     c   4 4 1 1 1 1 s k N    c  1 s N  2 s N  3 s N   Figure 3  Tree construction of OVSF codes The spreading sequences can’t keep completely orthogonal because of the Doppler shift and time delay spread characteristic of transmission channel in real systems, so joint detection \(JD\ algorithm is applied to eliminate the multiple access interference \(MAI\ between different users in the receiver. In order to reduce the complex of joint detection but ensure the system performance, the Minimum Mean Square Error \(MMSE equalization is applied in the JD algorithm The MMSE equalization, looks for a continuous valued unbiased estimate 000\003 MMSE BLE d  which minimizes  000\003  1 11 1 HH MMSE BLE knk x knk d      ARA R ARr 8 where k A is system matrix of user k which contains the information of spreading code k c and equivalent channel matrix  k H   kkk 007 HHu where k H and k u denote the channel matrix and the precoding vector of user k ter precoding k r denotes the received signal sequence of user k  x R and n R denote covariance matrix of transmit signal sequence x and the noise sequence n In this paper   H x 007 Rxx 001 000\022 and 2 n 003  RI The continuous valued estimate of \(8\ becomes 000\003  2 1 2 n x HH MMSE BLE kk kk d 003 003      RI RI AA I Ar 9 V  S IMULATION R ESULTS  In this section, we provide results on the achievable sum rates and bit error rate performance with the linear MU-MIMO schemes which have been described above We consider the Node B with four transmitting antennas and each user with two receive antennas, and we limited to single layer transmission to a particular user In Figure 4, we compare the achievable sum rates performance between different schemes. The upper part of Figure 4 shows results with 4 users competing for the available resources, and the lower part shows results of the scene with 20 users. The number of feedback bits per user is 2 plus one real number for the CQI indicator. And Figure 5 shows the corresponding bit error rate \(BER performance between different schemes  Figure 4  Sum rates performance comparison of different schemes  Figure 5  Bit error rate performance comparison of different schemes From Figure 4 and Figure 5, one can see that when the number of users is small, the achievable sum rates and bit error rate performance of ZF scheme is approximately the same as SU-MIMO scheme, and the performance of SP-JD is much better than ZF scheme. This is due to the fact that  4 users K  20 users K  20 users K  4 users K

in case of only 4 users, the probability of Node B schedule optimal users in the user subsets is small. But SP-JD can fully cancel the interference between different users with applying the orthogonal spreading sequence in the transmitter and joint detection in the receiver. When the number of users increases from 4 to 20, the performance of SU-MIMO scheme keep unchangeably, but SP-JD and ZF scheme is improved. The reason is that the probability of Node B schedule optimal users in the user subsets is big when the number of users is large. But at every SNR, the achievable sum rates and bit error rate performance of SPJD scheme is better than ZF scheme VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we proposed a novel multi-user MIMO scheme in OFDM systems. The proposed scheme overcomes the drawback that the receiver has to know the whole precoding matrix to reject the interference from the other users in the ZF scheme. And the simulation results show that the SP-JD scheme achieves better sum rates and bit error rate performance than ZF scheme. But the SP-JD scheme also has a drawback that it decreases the spectrum efficiency because of spreading is applied in SP-JD not to obtain code division multiple gains, but to cancel the interference between multiple users. So the SP-JD scheme is a tradeoff scheme between performance benefit and spectrum efficiency loss, and it is a valuable MU-MIMO scheme to apply in the system of LTE-Advanced/IMTAdvanced A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research was supported by the LTE TDD Terminal baseband chip R & D and industrialization project of National Development and Reform Commission Foundation of China, No. [2008 244 1  R EFERENCES  1  I.

212  002 1 where  002 2 where        analysis to confirm this hypothesis, however, after such early stage void growth voiding will be very small D  Analytical modeling Based on this reasoning, we propose an addition to the diffusion-creep model developed by McPherson and Dunn  F r o m fi gur e 7, w e se e  t h at    2  1 t  a 461 002 is the drift/VIA and t is the stress time. If we now define a failure time TTF as  1/2 f TTF  a 002 f is an arbitrary chosen failure criterion and we assume that this TTF is proportional to the voiding rate V R as defined in [10,11  w e can  rew r ite th e  d i f f u sio n c ree p m o d e l as f o ll o w s   212  212  002 T k E T k E N B II a B I a Be e T T A 2 2 2 0 4 where E a I and E a II represent the activation energies of the diffusion mechanisms from region I and II, respectively. The fit of this model to the data presented in figure 3 is shown in figure 9 for the structure with the M1-plane \(top\nd for the structure with the M2-plane \(bottom The activation energies in region I and II resulting from this fit are 0.9eV and 1.2eV, respectively. These values are in good agreement with literature values for interface and grain boundary diffusion [12 A l s o t h e f i t t e d v a l u es  of N   2  n d  T 0 225\260C\ are in good agreement with literature values [1   The obtained activation energies support our hypotheses that the degradation mechanism dominating in region I is due to interface diffusion \(section A\, while the diffusion processes causing the drifts in region II are driven by grain boundary diffusion \(section C The different peak locations for the M1- and M2-plane structures in region I are fitted well using our model. The peak is due to the interaction of the two co-existing mechanisms stress gradient driven- & vacancy gradient driven-vacancy diffusion\.  The peak occurs at different positions due to their interaction and can change position as one is more dominant in a given structure. Besides this, small differences in thermal treatments \(M1 undergoes post-plating anneal of M2\ and structural layouts \(such as height, presence of VIA,\205 between M1- and M2-layers can result in different stress- and vacancy gradients in these two layers resulting in different peak locations E  Kelvin structure Compared to the structure with the M1-plane, the drift/VIA of the Kelvin structure \(figure 3\ shows slower degradation in region I. The drift/VIA of this Kelvin is similar to the M2-plane structure in region II Based on our reasoning in section C, the behavior of the Kelvin structure in region II is to be expected: the drift in this region is due to vacancy movement in and above the VIAregion. For bigger M2-planes, more vacancies are present leading to faster drifts The slower drift in region I of the Kelvin compared to the structure with the M1-plane is however a bit surprising: one would expect the drift of the Kelvin to be driven by M1- and                                         0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 100 150 200 250 300 Temp \(\260C Drift/VIA \(Ohm 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Drift/VIA \(Ohm Diffusion-Creep model Arrhenius model Full model M1-plane M2-plane Region I 0.9eV Region II 1.2eV  Figure 9.

Both the data on the structure with the M1-plane \(top\ and the M2-plane bottom\ are shown.

M2-plane effects, resulting in a faster drift than any of the other two structures. We argue that this is due to the symmetry of the structure \(figure 10\: the VIA in the Kelvin is both below and on top surrounded by big metal planes. This implies a stress on the VIA that is equal in all directions. This is different for the other two structures used in this study \(figure 1\: for these structures, the VIA\222s are, at one end, connected to a metal line This metal line is in tensile stress and pulls the VIA to a certain extend in one preferred direction. This leads to higher stresses on the VIA compared to a symmetrical Kelvin structure which than leads to higher stress gradients, resulting in faster degradation This idea is further supported by our FE simulations Figure 11 shows the hydrostatic gradient under a VIA for symmetrical and asymmetrical structures. The symmetrical structure shows significantly smaller stress gradients compared to the asymmetrical structure IV  C ONCLUSIONS  The early stages of the stress-induced-voiding mechanism below and in VIA\222s have been studied for interconnects integrated in a porous low-k material, using structures with M1- or M2-planes, respectively.  It was observed that below 225\260C, a peak was present for both voiding mechanisms. The voiding below the VIA was more pronounced, but the voiding in the VIA was significant as well. FEM showed  much higher stress gradients present in the VIA for our materials compared to SiO 2 based dielectrics. We attribute the significant voiding in the VIA to this gradient.  Above 225\260C, we found a significant increase of the drift that was more pronounced for the M2-plane structures. By observing the lack of a temperature at which no drift occurred and using FEM, we argued that stress gradients alone could not be responsible for this shift. We attributed this shift to a vacancy gradient present in the VIA We proposed an addition to the model of McPherson and Dunn [10  w he r e w e a d d a n A r r he ni us t e r m t o t he  d i ffusi oncreep model enabling the appropriate description of porous low-k integration schemes. We find a good match between the modified model and the data. A fitted activation energy of 0.9eV below 225\260C supports interface diffusion in this region while a fitted activation energy of 1.2eV supports the hypothesis of grain boundary diffusion in the temperature region above 225\260C. We believe that performing SIV in this region do not allow a true study of the SIV-effect and that tests at lower temperatures are required when qualifying processes with respect to SIV Additionally, it is argued that VIA\222s connected to the center of big metal plates above and below are less susceptible to SIV compared to VIA\222s connected to line ends. Higher stress gradients are present in VIA\222s asymmetrically connected to line ends making them more susceptible to SIV. We believe this need to be taken into account when qualifying processes with respect to SIV A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors would like to thank the IST project  pullnano n o 026828 for financial support.

enterprises, the researchers do not however claim that the categories of IT adoption or of development outcomes are exhaustive. The applicability of the constructs is constrained by the sample size available and the inductive process used to evaluate the sample Despite this limitation, it is also important to note that the methodology used in this study is qualitative in nature and bottom up. In other words, the results and analysis is very strongly tied to the data and the conclusions have been derived bottom-up from the data. As per Straus e coding proces s us ed  in the study allows the researchers to apply their theoretical sensitivity to make sense of the data. Future focus groups may reveal other adoption categories. But as for the IT adoption categories discovered and developed in this current study, they are heavily rooted in the data and represent the actual context from which they were extracted   8. Conclusion  Micro-enterprises are crucial contributors to the economy, both in developed as well as in developing countries. Nonetheless, research has shown that they are often ill-adapted to the technological demands of the modern economy. In this study we used inductive reasoning, coding and classification to expand upon earlier research by Qureshi et al. [2 at pu t m i croentrepreneurs into technology attitude groups. We tied these attitude groups into a conceptual model of development outcome expectations, concluding that most of the entrepreneurs had limited and specific expectations concordant with their previous limited and specific technology exposure. Finally, we made some conjectures about the kinds of interventions that would be most suitable for these entrepreneurs. Future research will focus on testing and clarifying both the aforementioned technology attitude groups and the model tying the groups to specific outcome expectations. The hope is that a robust model will facilitate successful and sustained technology interventions in the future  9.
