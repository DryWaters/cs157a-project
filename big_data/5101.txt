primary mission is to survey the complex Saturnian system and release the ESA-Huygens probe at Titan The Cassini Integrated Test Lab ITL at JPL is a high-fidelity hardware-in-the-loop testbed It uses Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem AACS and Command and Data Subsystem CDS flight hardware H/W as well as high-fidelity simulations of the other spacecraft subsystems and signals System Testbeds like the Cassini ITL are often considered to be primarily used in the Final Design and Fabrication Phase and the System Assembly Integration  Test and Launch Phase of 
a Mission but the Cassini ITL has proven to be an essential component of an extremely successful Operations and Sustainment Phase This paper discusses the role of the Cassini ITL since Cassini's launch through cruise orbit insertion at Saturn probe release at Titan and throughout its tour as Cassini enters the final year of its primary mission 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION 1 2 DESCRIPTION OF ITL  3 3 DEFERRED DEVELOPMENT  3 4 UNPLANNED

Saturn include studying Saturn its rings and several of its satellites particularly Titan Enceladus Iapetus Mimas Tethys and Dione 1 Other objectives include the study of phenomena of the Saturnian system including the magnetosphere and its interaction with the solar wind plasma waves and radio emissions Cassini also seeks to detect gravitational waves 2 To accomplish these objectives the Cassini Spacecraft Figure 1 was designed and built for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL It carried the Huygens probe designed 
and built by the European Space Agency ESA which it released on December 24 2004 The probe arrived at Titan on January 14 2005 and broadcast data to the Cassini spacecraft that was later relayed to Earth Cassini was launched on October 15 1997 To save propellant Cassini made several gravity-assist flybys two at Venus and one each at Earth and Jupiter After an interplanetary cruise that lasted almost seven years the Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn on 
June 30 2004 Cassini fired one of its two rocket engines for about 96 minutes in order to slow the spacecraft's velocity by about 626 m/sec and allow it to be captured by the gravity field of Saturn Onboard science instruments were used to study the structure and composition of the rings during both the ascending and descending ring-plane crossings that happened before and after the Saturn Orbit Insertion SOI The spacecraft has been described as being about the size and weight 
of a school bus it is 6.8m long its maximum diameter in launch configuration was 4m and its total mass at launch was approximately 5800kg which included about 2700kg of dry mass and 3100kg of propellants Cassini carries twelve scientific instruments with each instrument performing its own internal control and data handling Three instruments have actuators that permit them to rotate individually about one axis otherwise the instruments are in fixed positions requiring that the entire spacecraft be turned 1 


to point an instrument in a desired direction The spacecraft also carries seven redundant engineering subsystems as all elements whose failure could cause loss of the mission or loss of data from more than one scientific instrument are redundant The Cassini Integrated Test Lab ITL focuses its attention on two of these the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem AACS and the Command and Data Subsystem CDS The AACS contains redundant MIL-STD1 750A flight computers The AACS receives commands from the CDS via the redundant MIL-STD-1553B CDS data bus and sends commands over its own redundant MIL-STD-1553B data bus to AACS assemblies AACS provides attitude control of the three-axis stabilized spacecraft either by Reaction Wheel Assembly RWA control or by thruster Reaction Control System RCS control and the thrusters are also used to unload the momentum of the reaction control wheels Celestial attitude reference is supplied by a Sun Sensor Assembly SSA and a stellar reference unit SRU which uses a charge-coupled device sensor Inertial reference is accomplished using vibrating gyros Spacecraft pointing accuracy is 2 mrad or better when the spacecraft is not thrusting or rotating The AACS also controls the spacecraft flight trajectory through command of the main engine and thruster valves An accelerometer on the central axis aids in controlling the duration of engine bums The CDS manages the communication commanding and telemetry of the other spacecraft subsystems The CDS consists of redundant MIL-STD-1750A flight computers and communicates with the other spacecraft subsystems via its data bus The CDS stores engineering and science data and memory loads in two 1.8-gigabit solid-state recorders SSRs The CDS receives ground commands and memory loads from the spacecraft's Radio Frequency Subsystem RFS then processes and distributes them to instruments and other subsystems It receives data from instruments and other subsystems formats it for telemetry supplies ReedSolomon encoding and delivers the telemetry to the RFS for transmission to Earth 2 On Cassini most commanding is accomplished with nominal command sequences which are programs Figure 1 Cassini Spacecraft 2 


consisting of time-tagged lists of commands and macros Sequences are stored and executed by the CDS The commands in sequence programs are executed sequentially and their time-tags can be relative to the previous command or absolute i.e specifying a certain time at which the command is to execute These sequences specify actions down to the level of detailed hardware commands whose effects can potentially be felt across spacecraft subsystem boundaries 3 2 DESCRIPTION OF ITL Cassini's hardware-in-the-loop system testbed is the ITL The ITL consists of CDS Hardware H/W and Support Equipment SE and AACS H/W and SE Either the CDS SE or the AACS SE simulates the other spacecraft subsystems Occasionally the Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem PPS H/W RFS H/W or science instruments are connected via the spacecraft bus in which case their simulators are not used 3 The Cassini Integrated Test Lab has dual redundant AACS and CDS flight computers running software identical to that used in flight Most of the primary AACS H/W Engineering Model EM or flight spare is connected and tested in the loop and the Remote Engineering Units REUs and the Solid State Recorders are used as well A sophisticated real time simulation of the optical and physical environment is provided to the AACS sensors in real time to simulate bright bodies and stars based on orientation and linear and angular accelerations and velocities stemming from the internal and external forces on the spacecraft S/C In this way the actual command sequences can be run and the CDS SSRs REUs and AACS interact while the appropriate sensors in the AACS are being stimulated with an environment equivalent to that expected in flight In addition science instruments can be connected as needed This H/W in the loop design yields the highest fidelity representation of the Cassini S/C on the ground Since the CDS and the AACS H/W are designed to operate in flight their SE is designed to generate all of the signals and stimuli necessary to simulate the flight environment The Testbed can run in subsystem mode tests using only CDS H/W or only AACS H/W with all other subsystems simulated or system mode using both CDS and AACS H/W The itl startup script is used to initialize whatever H/W is being used and runs with a configuration file that specifies variables for a given test The ITL is typically initialized to a default time generally day 1 of the current year if a test is not dependent upon a specific time Many tests however must be executed at a specific time and so this time is specified in the configuration file The CDS keeps the time called the spacecraft event time SCET and propagates it to the other subsystems keeping them in synchronization with a periodic time broadcast Hence the CDS can be initialized to any desired time Once the SCET is set it can also be changed without fault protection activity although when the AACS FSW is running a special procedure must be used and due to limitations of the simulation software the time can only be moved forward for a period of about a month or less In the case of a system mode test when the itl startup script is complete the CDS is running in RAM with a prime and backup string both SSRs are loaded with the CDS AACS and instrument FSW and the SCET is set The AACS is running in RAM with a prime and backup string the prime AACS string is in home base and Inertial Vector Propagation IVP is initialized either with specified or default vectors These states are consistent with the nominal states in flight The ITL's primary hardware-in-the-loop testbed is illustrated in Figure 2 3 DEFERRED DEVELOPMENT Cassini launched without the FSW capability to perform significant portions of its primary mission including SOI the relay of probe data and some of its planned tour capability This was all according to plan since launch occurred nearly 7 years before orbit insertion and much of the needed FSW development was planned for the interim Deferred AACS FSWDevelopment Cassini was launched without reaction wheel attitude control capability the main-engine burn algorithm necessary for SOI 4 and Fault Protection Algorithms to support the Probe Relay activity 5 These capabilities were developed and added incrementally Deferred CDS FSW Development The bulk of the deferred development in the CDS FSW had to do with SSR management SSR enhancements included partitioning priority playback switching to the other SSR when the first one was full and duplicate recording of critical data Another deferred enhancement was data policing rejecting data from an instrument after it had exceeded a ground-specified limit At launch 2 FSW loads for each engineering subsystem and instrument were stored and these loads were collectively treated as identical or different another planned enhancement that was implemented was the ability to label these loads identical or different independently The final group of deferred capabilities included SSR error checking algorithms System Fault Protection SFP enhancements and an SFP response to swap to the High Gain antenna and go to a high 3 


telemetry mode if certain conditions exist after a safing event safing occurs when the FSW detects a severe fault all non critical devices are powered off and the S/C is put into a safe configuration Critical Sequence Testing Ordinarily sequences are aborted in the event of safing but some sequences govern activities that are vital to mission success and so continue even in the event of safing Such sequences are called critical sequences Cassini has executed 3 critical sequences Launch SOI and Probe Relay Obviously Launch Sequence testing was completed prior to launch but the SOI and Probe Relay Sequences were not even developed until after launch There were several iterations of extensive testing of each sequence in the ITL 4 UNPLANNED FSW DEVELOPMENT In at least one case the planned deferred development was revisited and altered the burn algorithm Energy Burn that was ultimately used for SOI was developed about 2 years prior to SOI 6 In addition to the deferred FSW capabilities other desired capabilities were implemented One notable case is the SSR Library Region As the spacecraft neared its destination and instrument activity began in earnest it became apparent that expanded blocks of software for the instruments would provide expanded capabilities The Immediate Execution Blocks IEBs required storage space on the SSRs and space was found above and below the region where the CDS FSW load was stored This space was called the Library Region 7 The library region was implemented along with the last group of deferred CDS capabilities Then in 2007 it was decided to uplink a new version of the CDS FSW This was not in the original plan but became desirable because of the potential for a certain type of failure in the SSRs With previous versions of FSW the failure could have resulted in an unrecoverable fault in the event of a CDS reset The failure may still occur but with CDs AACS Support Support quipment SSR B C B Equipment A\(CS Peripherals Scietce I nstrument Figure 2 ITL Block Diagram 4 SSR A CD Ao1 AACS A BACS 


the new CDS FSW version it can be absorbed with little impact Of course once the decision was made to develop a new FSW version many issues that had arisen over the years but were accepted because of insufficient impact became possibilities for inclusion in the new build and some were indeed addressed with the new FSW 5 AACS FSW UPDATES The orbital inclination of the Cassini spacecraft changes gradually as the mission progresses Additionally the effective thrust of the RCS system decreases as propellant is used and the pressure in the propellant tank decreases Default safing profile and thruster values are necessary in the unlikely event of an AACS computer reset and reload of FSW so such values are updated periodically The ITL is used to test these updates and to regression test the patched FSW to ensure its integrity 6 GROUND SYSTEM TESTING The Multi-Mission Ground Data System MGDS is comprised of the hardware and software used on the ground to receive and process telemetry from the spacecraft Ground system software is updated for a variety of reasons including the correction of problems the addition of new capabilities and tools and the implementation of changes to support new telemetry standards which occur with FSW updates The ITL is the first stop for most ground system updates since they are generally released in the ITL about 2 months prior to being released to the flight team Additionally many of the ground system tools are tested in the ITL tools to generate commands IEBs and sequences tools to process and display telemetry tools to query telemetered data etc Ground System development and testing is also done indirectly in the ITL essentially as a component of other work performed there chiefly FSW development and testing It bears mention that in the ITL telemetered data is not broadcast but is delivered directly to the ground system and so requires different processing at least as it enters the system than does flight data Thus the ITL has some unique ground system components for this purpose 7 FLIGHT ACTIVITY TESTING The ITL has had a continuing role in the Verification and Validation of many flight activities such as background sequences modules maneuvers Radio Science Subsystem RSS experiments flybys uplink procedures contingencies and analyses This testing is described in more detail below Background Sequence Testing Most of Cassini's activities are controlled by sequences that are designed to run for several weeks called background sequences In the early days of Cassini's flight many aspects of these sequences were tested At this stage of the mission we still test portions of background sequences that are first time events or have some other associated risk Modules Cassini uses on-board programs to generate AACS commands for typical observation scenarios These programs are called modules Several deliveries of the modules have occurred over the life of the program All have been thoroughly tested in ITL Maneuvers Trajectory Correction Maneuvers TCMs and Orbit Trim Maneuvers OTMs are necessary to adjust the path of the spacecraft Maneuvers are built from established templates called blocks The blocks undergo thorough testing in ITL before they are used to generate flight maneuvers Early in the mission every maneuver was tested in ITL At this point in the mission only maneuvers that have some unusual risk are tested RSS Experiments The RSS makes regular use of the ITL to test Atmospheric Occultations and Bistatic Experiments In the case of an atmospheric occultation the spacecraft sends a signal to earth as it emerges from occultation by a body with an atmosphere The signal transmitted by the S/C is refracted by the atmosphere and the High Gain Antenna HGA is pointed in such a way as to account for this refraction so that the signal still reaches earth In the case of a Bistatic Experiment the signal from the HGA is actually directed toward a body in such a way that the reflection is received at earth In both cases proper pointing is essential The RSS team specifies the desired pointing in an Inertial Vector Definition IVD file ITL tests verify the implementation of the IVD These ITL simulations have proven to be remarkably accurate This testing has occasionally uncovered errors in implementation and has frequently resulted in modifications to the IVD file Flybys Titan flybys are often tested in the ITL Among other things this is to verify that control authority is maintained within the required dead-bands despite the predicted external torques to verify that the prime instrument pointing is maintained and to confirm control authority despite the predicted atmospheric density Tests have also 5 


been performed to determine the atmospheric density at which tumbling would occur Uplink Procedures The ITL is used to provide the most realistic environment possible to test flight procedures such as FSW updates FSW updates occur fairly frequently considering that there are 13 engineering subsystems and instruments that use them Many files are not approved for uplink in flight until they have been tested in ITL Contingencies The ITL has also been used to test contingency files Once contingencies are identified probable recovery paths are developed and tested including uplink files that can be used in flight This has enabled the project to set aside tested and approved files to be used if necessary Analysis The ITL has also been used for various analyses For example the AACS FSW maintains a log of all Fault Protection related actions these actions may be initiated by Fault Protection processes or by other processes in FSW but they are logged if they are relevant to AACS Fault Protection The actions are recorded with a time stamp and this time stamp has a format unique to the AACS FSW In 2006 the FSW team realized that this time stamp format would rollover at a certain time prior to the end of the mission ITL testing demonstrated that this rollover would be isolated to the fault protection log and would therefore be benign 8 FLIGHT INSTRUMENT TESTING There are 3 instruments resident at JPL the Imaging Science Subsystem ISS RADAR and the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer VIMS The ISS RADAR and VIMS are operated in a special instrument testbed usually in stand-alone mode but the instruments can be and frequently are connected to the ITL via a spacecraft bus extension The other instrument teams are based at other locations in the United States and abroad Instrument testbeds often become more important postlaunch rather than prior to launch and the instrument teams at JPL and elsewhere have made extensive use of the ITL Imaging Science Subsystem ISS The ITL is an important resource for the ISS subsystem because the subsystem consists of 2 cameras a Narrow Angle Camera NAC and a Wide Angle Camera WAC Because the CDS could not support the bandwidth for simultaneous transmission of images from both cameras over the S/C bus the cameras share a Remote Terminal address The ISS testbed does not support this sharing of a Remote Terminal address and so the ITL is the only place on earth to test the cameras in a flight-like configuration The ISS team has made use of the ITL to support debug analysis to understand bus data in order to improve the Ground System to test unique sequences and first time events and to verify engineering rather than ground system generated sequences for in-flight anomaly resolution In addition to these tests the ISS team used the ITL for Verification and Validation of its only FSW update since launch Another interesting ISS problem that was solved in the ITL occurred when flight data did not jibe with expected performance The cameras in the testbed have flightqualified electronics so it was possible to run timing tests and expect similar performance to the cameras on-board Cassini These tests demonstrated that the documentation for the cameras was inaccurate RADAR The ITL has become very important to the RADAR team because it provides the capability to maximize RADAR data collection The maximum data collection rate at which the RADAR does not drop data is dependant on the geometry of a given observation Testing these observations in the ITL allows a data gain of 10-20 This may not seem like much but the data collected is typically used for SAR Synthetic Aperture RADAR during Titan close approach flybys This is essentially the RADAR's main objective for the Cassini Mission and maximizing the data return of these observations provides a large increase in the science quality of the data collected Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer VIMS Data policing was one of the deferred development capabilities in CDS FSW but after it was implemented the VIMS team found that VIMS data was occasionally being policed when VIMS was not transmitting image data This is possible because as long as the instrument is powered and the CDS is in a telemetry mode that expects data from the instrument the CDS will collect data If the instrument does not have data to transmit it transmits a special packet that does not get recorded on the SSR Analysis in the ITL revealed that VIMS packet sizes did not always match CDS expectations when certain telemetry mode changes were commanded a VIMS FSW bug and when the packets were larger than expected they were policed even though they did not contain valid data The VIMS team also benefited from ITL testing in the implementation of IEBs VIMS has always sought to maximize their IEB space so it pleased the team when it was discovered through ITL testing that the Ground System was shorting VIMS by one 22 word block of IEB space in the SSR library region VIMS also swapped IEB space with another instrument Cassini Plasma Spectrometer CAPS 6 


that had a larger allocation ITL testing smoothed the transition Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer INMS Perhaps the primary reason that the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer INMS was included in Cassini's instrument suite was to analyze the atmosphere at Titan to inform the final decisions that would be made regarding the probe mission As Cassini neared this phase of the mission the INMS experienced unexpected resets The INMS team brought an EM INMS instrument to the ITL from their facilities at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in order to take advantage of the ITL's CDS H/W and debug the problem Although the bug was not found this work enabled the INMS team to develop a strategy to work around the problem and successfully return the valuable data Cosmic Dust Analyzer CDA At various times the Cosmic Dust Analyzer CDA team has brought a flight spare and an EM CDA to the ITL from their home base at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg Germany They have used the ITL to successfully debug anomalous behavior and to validate and verify FSW deliveries Post-launch it was discovered that the in-flight CDA was susceptible to single event latch-ups The behavior was studied and a workaround was developed and tested in the ITL The solution involves a signal from the CDA when the condition is detected which triggers a CDS Fault Protection response that is executed by the PPS The use of the ITL was essential for developing and testing the solution on the ground as it could not be done in the CDA's stand-alone testbed The flight spare CDA was used in the ITL to ensure that changes to internal task scheduling in a new CDA FSW delivery did not affect S/C bus interaction S/C bus traffic timing analysis and system level tests were needed to demonstrate that proper functioning of the new FSW and this testing could only have been accomplished in the ITL 9 ANOMALY RESOLUTION There have been a few in-flight anomalies for Cassini 7 The ITL has been used in such cases to recreate the anomalous conditions and to test the recovery processes and the uplink products that were used in the recoveries In September 2007 there was a Solid State Power Switch SSPS 8 trip that resulted in a S/C safing event Cassini's first safing event during its primary mission The SSPS was one of a redundant pair powering the prime Telemetry Control Unit TCU Since this is a vital device the trip resulted in safing The safing event occurred only hours after an Iapetus flyby and recovery had an increased urgency as the science community anxiously awaited that data After the flight team confirmed the failure playback of the Iapetus flyby data was commanded and the process to be followed for recovery was identified The special files and procedures required for the recovery were tested in the ITL and the recovery was accomplished successfully in flight 10 TRAINING Periodically the Cassini flight team conducts Operational Readiness Tests ORTs These are essentially exercises in which a hypothetical problem is presented to the flight team and the team must formulate and execute a recovery The ITL is used to simulate the problem and the recovery providing the team with as realistic an experience as possible as for the AACS and CDS subsystems at least telemetry from the ITL is very similar to flight telemetry Additionally only a small subset of the flight team is dedicated to preparing the fault scenario those team members responsible for designing the fault and initializing the testbed then step aside under strict orders to maintain silence while the rest of the team determines and corrects the fault These ORTs have tremendous value the TCU SSPS fault that actually occurred in flight and was discussed in the preceding section was fortuitously chosen by the Cassini Spacecraft Office Manager Julie Webster as the fault scenario for an ORT in 2006 which of course made detection and recovery when the fault actually occurred in flight even more swift and sure The Cassini ITL has also been used to train both Cassini personnel and new JPL employees who have been hired for other project assignments Such training has involved the engineer functioning as a test analyst for 6 months The ITL benefits from the extra manpower and the employee benefits from the training and the exposure to a large flight project 11 CONCLUSION Cassini continues to enjoy a long and successful primary mission The ITL has been an important component in that success and continues to provide valuable services to the mission These services include  Deferred FSW Development and Testing  Unplanned FSW Development and Testing  FSW Updates  Ground System Testing 7 


 Flight Activity Testing  Flight Instrument Testing  Anomaly Resolution  Training The ITL has proven its value to the Cassini Mission to Saturn time and again Originally created for the integration of flight H/W and the development of FSW the ITL was maintained to accomplish Cassini's deferred development Interestingly enough while that deferred development was taking place the ITL was becoming an essential component of instrument testing and sequence development as well as maneuver and flight activity testing So in Cassini's case the ITL was necessary for post-launch activities i.e deferred development but as a result of being available during the prime mission proved to be an invaluable resource for purposes that were not originally anticipated The cost of the ITL has varied over the course of the Cassini mission but typically approaches 10 of the Cassini Spacecraft Office Operations budget i.e the engineering operations budget as distinguished from the science operations budget At present the ITL annual budget is approximately 800,000 during Integration during Assembly Test and Launch Operations ATLO and during critical sequence testing the ITL team was larger and so the cost was higher The annual cost to maintain the testbed regular cleaning certifications instrument calibration facilities maintenance etc is approximately 25,000 These costs are significant but not prohibitive and this paper has shown that the ITL has proven to be a valuable asset to the Cassini Mission and has justified its expense As Cassini plans its 3-year extended mission the ITL is included in that plan to continue in its present capacity That capacity includes engineers with expertise in the AACS and the CDS who function as test operators and analysts engineers with expertise in SE H/W and S/W who maintain the SE and implement improvements and a System Administrator the ITL maintains a web page so that test reports and test data are web-accessible and the data is also archived With some overlap in expertise and some engineers working only part-time on Cassini the ITL team at the present time is comprised of the equivalent of about 4 full time employees Many flight projects use System Testbeds for the purposes of integrating flight H/W and testing critical activities purposes that are sometimes accomplished by launch and generally by arrival at their destinations The author recommends that such flight projects seriously consider maintaining System Testbeds throughout the lives of their missions The use of a System Testbed the Cassini ITL has activities removed errors and oversights in flight procedures through testing credibly tested ground system tools and software improved maneuvers and solved problems that have occurred in flight At less than 10 of the engineering operations budget System Testbeds provide improved reliability improved functionality a significant and positive impact on mission success and a substantial return on investment ACRONYMS AACS  ATLO  CAPS  CDA  CDS  EM ESA FSW  HGA  HIW  IEB INMS ISS ITL IVD IVP JPL MGDS NAC  NASA  ORT  OTM  PPS RCS REU RFS RSS RWA S/C SCET SE SFP SoI SRU SSA SSPS SSR TCM TCU VIMS WAC Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem Assembly test and Launch Operations Cassini Plasma Spectrometer Cosmic Dust Analyzer Command and Data Subsystem Engineering Model European Space Agency Flight Software High Gain Antenna Hardware Immediate Execution Block Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer Imaging Science Subsystem Integrated Test Lab Inertial Vector Definition Inertial Vector Propagation Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multi-mission Ground Data System Narrow Angle Camera National Aeronautics and Space Administration Operational Readiness Test Orbit Trim Maneuver Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem Reaction Control System Remote Engineering Unit Radio Frequency Subsystem Radio Science Subsystem Reaction Wheel Assembly Spacecraft Spacecraft Event Time Support Equipment System Fault Protection Saturn Orbit Insertion Stellar Reference Unit Sun Sensor Assembly Solid State Power Switch Solid State Recorder Trajectory Correction Maneuver Telemetry Control Unit Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer Wide Angle Camera improved science data return improved instrument 8
