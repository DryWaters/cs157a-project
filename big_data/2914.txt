An Intrusion Detect ion Algorithm Model Based on Extension Clusteri ng Support Vector Machine  Zhao Rui, Yu Yongquan, Cheng Minjun Faculty of Computer  Guangdong University of Technology  Guangzhou, China zhaorui118204@163.com  yyq@gdut.edu.cn cmj3602@gdut.edu.cn   Abstract  Intrusion detection technology is a key research direction in information technology. For intrusion detection method based support vector machine\(SVM\, there is a big obstacle that the amount of audit data for modeling is very large even for a small network scale, so it’s impractical to 
directly train SVM using original training datasets. Selecting important features from input dataset leads to a simplification of the problem, however a defect caused is the lack of sparseness. All training data will become the support vectors of SVM, which causes the low intrusion detection speed. We propose a novel SVM intrusion detection algorithm model using the method of extension clustering which is utilized to obtain a subset including support vectors. Through this approximation, the training dataset is downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model is reduced, which will greatly help to improve the 
response time of intrusion detection. Comparing to others, the arithmetic model is simple implement and better performance So it is worth applying and popularizing  Keywords-intrusion detection; extension clustering;support vector machine I   I NTRODUCTION  With the development of computer network technology more attacks on computer networks are carried out by exploiting unknown weaknesses or bugs always contained in system and application software  H e nce  co m p ut er security has been receiving a lot of attention in recent years Intrusion Detection System \(IDS\plays vital role of detecting various kinds of attacks. The main purpose of IDS 
is to find out intrusions among normal audit data and this can be considered as classification problem Two approaches to intrusion detection are conventionally used [2  o n e i s m i suse  de t ect i o n a n d t h e ot he r i s a n o m a l y detection. Misuse detection is an attack signature-based approach that utilizes a detailed description of the sequence of actions performed by the attacker. This approach detects a series of actions as an attack only if it matches a previously seen attack signature identically. Hence, if a new attack is made, the system fails to recognize it. But due to the requirement of low false alarm rates, most popular intrusion detection systems fall into this category. Another approach to 
intrusion detection is called anomaly detection. Anomaly detection is based on modeling the normal activity of the computer system. Unfortunately, the acquisition of profiles of normal activity is not an easy task. The audit records used to produce the profiles of normal activity may contain traces of intrusions leading to misdetections, and also activities of legitimate users often deviate from their normal profile as modeled, leading to high false alarm rates. There are many IDSs developed during the past three decades and most of the commercial and freeware IDS tools are signature based But when new attacks appear and amount of audit data increases, IDS should counteract them. In addition to this, as 
network speed becomes faster, there is an emerging need for security analysis techniques that will be able to keep up with the increased network throughput[3 Th e r ef o r e IDS its elf  should be lightweight \(means relatively low computational cost\hile guaranteeing high detection rates. In this paper we propose a new lightweight intrusion detection model based on extension clustering support vector machine EC-SVM\. Our model mainly focuses on how to effectively detect intrusions in the real-time network environment Firstly, we extract several necessary and much important features \(named core features\rom network traffic dataset by means of Principal Component Analysis \(PCA\ [4   Secondly, we adopt extension clustering to get a subset 
including support vectors. Then use the training data in the subset to form classifier for detecting attacks based on the selected features, which will improve detection efficiency and shorten response time  II   S UPPORT VECTOR MACHINE SVM Support Vector Machines \(SVM\is a learning system based on statistical learning theory. Theoretically, one main reason for the superior performance is that SVM embodies the Structural Risk Minimization \(SRM\principle to minimize an upper bound on the expected risk [5 Geometrically, SVM modeling algorithm works by constructing a separating hyperplane with maximal margin

Support Vector machine \(SVM\is a newly proposed machine learning approach, which has become a popular research method in intrusion detection, and good results are reported [8 III  I NTRUSION DETECTION MODEL BASED ON EXTENSION CLUSTERING SVM  EC-SVM The overall model of our approach is depicted in Fig. 1 In the training process, network traffic dataset is passed to our feature selection engine using PCA approach Afterwards, extension clustering is used to build subset basis of original set populated by training data for intrusion detection model. In the testing process, network traffic data will directly sent to our intrusion detection model to detect The most advantage of our lightweight model is that by means of feature selection, it can greatly reduce the redundant and least important features for intrusion detection, therefore reduce the computational cost in the process of intrusion detection. Moreover, through extension clustering, the training data was downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model were reduced, which greatly helped to improve the response time of intrusion detection  IV  F EATURE SELECTION  Principal Component Analysis \(PCA\ a powerful technique for extracting features from data sets. But traditional PCA has several problems. Recently kernel trick has been applied to PCA and kernel trick is based on a formulation of PCA in terms of the dot product matrix instead of the covariance matrix [10  K e rn el  P C A  K P CA    however, requires storing and finding the eigenvectors of a N 000h N kernel matrix where N is a number of patterns. It is infeasible method when N is large. To extract on-line nonlinear features, we adopt a new feature extraction method 11  w h i c h  ov er c o m e s t h e  pr ob l e m  of m e m o ry re qu i r em en t  of KPCA by on-line eigenspace update method incorporating with an adaptation of kernel function In this section, we will give a brief introduction to the method of on-line PCA algorithm which overcomes the computational complexity and memory requirement of standard PCA. Before continuing, a note on notation is in order. Vectors are columns, and the size of a vector, or matrix, where it is important, is denoted with subscripts Particular column vectors within a matrix are denoted with a superscript, while a superscript on a vector denotes a particular observation from a set of observations, so we treat   observationsas column vectors of a matrix. As an example i mn A is the ith column vector in an m×n matrix . We denote a column extension to a matrix using square brackets Thus b A i mn  an  m n  1   m atrix w ith v ect o r  b  appended to i mn A  as a last column. To explain the on-line PCA, we assume that we have already built a set of eigenvectors U = [uj  j    1       k a f t e r ha vi ng t r a i ned t h e input data xi \(i = 1, · · ·, N\. The corresponding eigenvalues are 002\001 and x  is the mean of input vector. On-line building of eigenspace requires to update these eigenspace to take into account of a new input data. Here we give a brief summarization of the method which is described in [12   First, we update the mean   1 1  1     N x x N N x 3 Then we update the set of eigenvectors to reflect the new input vector and to apply a rotational transformation to U For doing this, it is necessary to compute the orthogonal residual vector 1 1         N N x x Ua h and normalize it to obtain 2 1 1 1       N N N h h h for 0   2 1   N h and 0 1   N h otherwise. We obtain the new matrix of Eigenvectors U 004 by appending 1  N h  to the eigenvectors U and rotating them     1 R h U U N   004 4 where R \037 R k+1\\(k+1 is a rotation matrix.

Positive number expresses that there is the degree of certain characteristic. Negative means that there is not the degree of certain characteristic. Zero means that there is and there is not certain characteristic B  Extension clustering Definition 2: Based on definition on extensible set and the constructing method of its dependent function, we can make an alterable classification for all research objects This classification method is called extension clustering method [13   The followings are the basic steps of extension clustering method 1 Define classical domain and modulatory domain Suppose N i i=1,2,...,m\ a subset of set P, and P 0 is an object being tested \(P 0 001\031 P\. For judging P 0 belongs to which subset, we must define classical domain R i i=1,2,...,m\ and modulatory domain R p firstly[1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000        000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000   in in n i i i i i in n i i i i j i i b a c b a c b a c N X c X c X c N X c N R            2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000        000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000   pn pn n p p p p pn n p p p j p b a c b a c b a c P X c X c X c P X c P R            2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1   2 Define an object being tested P 0 as specific matter element R 0  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000  n n x c x c x c p R   2 2 1 1 0 0  3 Compute dependent degree by dependent function 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 010  012                     j i j ij ij j j i j ij i pj j ij j j i X x X X x X x X x X x X x x K 013 013 013 013 7 000   n j ij j ij j ij b x b x a 1   8 In the formula \(8\, a ij is weight coefficient.

In actual case we must get core features of network traffic dataset by the new feature extraction approach based PCA firstly. Suppose the selected features are CPU_occupation_rate duration_time, root_user_access_times, port_scan_times and special_file_access_times etc. Then we should know about their value information of some features in normal and abnormal action by a general survey or previous experience 
17 


Based on the known value information, for example, we can define classical domains and modulatory domain of normal and abnormal action and denote them as R 0i i=1,2\ and R p  respectively  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000            5  1 _ _ _ 5  1 _ _ 5  1 _ _ _ 100  0 _ 30  0 _ _  Normal 01 times access file special times scan port times access user root time duration rate occupation CPU R 000\003\000\003 000\003\000\003 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000            15  5 _ _ _ 15  5 _ _ 10  5 _ _ _ 1000  500 _ 100  50 _ _  Abormal 02 times access file special times scan port times access user root time duration rate occupation CPU R 000\003 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000            15  1 _ _ _ 15  1 _ _ 10  1 _ _ _ 1000  0 _ 100  0 _ _ Action times access file special times scan port times access user root time duration rate occupation CPU R p 000\003 000\003 Then using formula \(7\, formula \(8\and formula \(9\of extension clustering, dependent degree of every action belonging to two classes will be computed. For those actions whose dependent degree belonging to the two classes is not much strong. This means these data justly lay in the margin area of the two classes. And support vectors used classify mainly come from the area. So we can collect them together and form a subset basis of original network traffic dataset This is the new training dataset for classifier based SVM. By this way, the efficiency of training new classifier will be improved and the cost of response time will be decrease greatly. So the model has great actual value VII  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed a novel EC-SVM intrusion detection model using extension clustering to construct a subset basis of original set populated by training data Through this approximation, the training data was downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model was reduced and the model building time was shortened, which greatly improved the network intrusion detection’s performance. And It provided an instance to explain the actual application of the model. But above research is the first step. There are many works to do after it such as more details of the model application and so on. The model effectively integrates extenics with SVM. It also provides a new method for solving intrusion detecting. So the new model has great applied value  VIII   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors are grateful to National Natural Science Foundation of China \(60272089\nd Science Foundation of Guangdong University of Technology for decisive support IX  R EFERENCES  1  J.

For this analysis we chose to use \223worst day\224 events because they correlated well to a per-day error rate and the available solar data.  During solar events the magnetosphere is typically disturbed so the \223stormy\224 condition is included in the simulation.  As with the GCR proton results these predictions are only applicable to hydrogen  5  Solar energetic particle heavy ion predictions are identical to the SEP pr otons except that they apply to elements 2 through 92  Analytical Function Fitting Method The error cross-section of the data presented in this report was plotted with Poisson error bars and fit with Weibull curves.  A proprietary SEAKR MATLAB 256 routine was utilized to solve for the best curve fit using several statistical metrics.  The Weibull curve is defined by four parameters: saturated cross sec tion, Linear Energy Transfer LET\threshold, the Weibull shape parameters Width and Exponent. These parameters are used by the Heavy ion Upset \(HUP\on Upset \(PUP\modules in CREME96 Orbit Calculation The SPENVIS tool was used to calculate both the amount of time the spacecraft spends in the South Atlantic Anomaly and also the Total Ionizing Dose \(TID during the mission.  The orbital generator tool uses temporal information, the altitude, and the inclination to create a data file detailing the orbit of the mission.  This file can then be plotted; examples of a daily orbit tracks are shown in Figures 2 and 3 A comparison of various Sensitive Volumes \(SVs\n Poivey et al  reveal ed that while there was a conn ection between SV and heavy ion related upset rates, the mission upset rates were typically dominated by the SAA proton-dense trapped proton environment.  The SV was varied over a range between 0.25 m and 7 m and never represented more than 23% of the total mission upset count for orbits which included the SAA.  For space sy stems outside of the Earth\222s protective magnetosphere the contribution of sensitive volume could vary the predicted upset rate by more than 200% since there are no trapped protons.  A conservative SV of 0.5 \265m was used for all memories in this analysis 


  6 Environmental Methodology The on-orbit averaged trapped proton models in the CREME96 application take into account all trapped protons for a particular orbit, including not only the low-density of protons trapped by the Earth\222s magnetosphere, but also those trapped in proton-dense regions such as the SAA These orbit-averaged trapped protons contribute continuously to the upset rate of the memory and are thus weighted at 100% when used to calculate the daily bit-upset rates.  The other results from the HUP and PUP modules which need to be weighted are the solar event particles versus the galactic particles.  The actual worst-case SPE space weather covering all of the missions was obtained from National Geophysical Data Center \(NGDC National Oceanic Atmospheri c Administration \(NOAA The weighting values used fo r each radiation environment for each space system is different, and the values used in the analyses are shown Table 3   Figure 2. Plotted above is the influence of trapped protons along the Program III Orbit showing the space system\222s typical da ily path, which clearly transits the proton-dense SAA \(colored squares several times daily Plot generated with SPENVIS  Figure 3. Trapped protons along the orbit of Program I showing multiple transits of the SAA \(colored squares Plot generated with SPENVIS  Total Ionizing Dose Calculation Once the trajectory files are cr eated, the total ionizing dose for each orbit can be calculated using another SPENVIS model, SHIELDOSE-2.  SHIELDOSE-2 is based upon Monte Carlo calculations of electron and proton interactions with aluminum.   It takes into account various detector materials and accounts for transport through the spacecraft wall [5 Figure 4 shows the effect calculated for various thicknesses In order to compare the relationship between TID and SEU rates for various missions we examined these radiation phenomena as a function of the actual radiation environment for each mission Figure 5 shows the actual corrected errors for a space syst em in a polar orbit at an altitude of 830 km.  The predicted total dose accumulated at a rate of 1.26 krad [Si per y ear and has been scaled linearly and overlaid on the plot \(purple line\Also overlaid are the scaled sunspot cycle \(NGDC data   showing a decrease towards a solar minimum, and the scaled coronal mass ejection contribution \(NOAA  and SOHO [10  data\th the corresponding scaled CREME96 worst case day \(October 1989 event\.  There appears to be two potential contributions to the increased upset rate of the device.  The first potential contribution is the increase of accumulated dose on the device which may cause an increase in device susceptib ility.  The second potential contribution is a little more complex.  As the solar cycle approaches a solar minimum, the Earth\222s magnetosphere becomes less \223stormy\224 and thus more exposed to external GCR protons and heavy ions which allows more potential for an SEU to occur.  There does not appear to be a noticeable contribution from CMEs to the limited upset rate data 5  R ESULTS  On-orbit upset data from 3853 COTS DRAM components with 64, 128, and 256 Mb densities that provide 507 Gb of storage capacity and represent 1.8E8 on-orbit DRAM device hours in SEAKR built and designed SSRs has been presented in this report. When the mission orbits are run through CREME96 and weighted using the observed space weather for their mission duration to date, upset predictions are shown to be up to 10 times more conservative than observed upsets. Analysis has been performed to help determine possible attribution for the significant difference between the observed and predicted numbers of upsets Table 4 summarizes the orbit, shielding, and durations of the missions used.  These results demonstrate that the models used in CREME96 coupled with conservative Weibull fits to accelerator da ta may lead to conservative upset rate prediction.  It is worth noting that in the last decade, we have only experien ced 4.9 CME induced \223worst days\224. This analysis may be useful to those who are 


  7 responsible for providing mission specifications for the ionizing radiation environment It is also worth noting that none of the missions analyzed here have experienced any unc orrectable DRAM errors This observation implies that th ere are no destructive effects such as SEL which have been observed in any of the DRAM components in 1.8E8 device hours on-orbit   Table 3.

Sensitive volume for earth orbiting spacecraft which transit thr ough the Van Allen belts is negligible compared to trapped protons. Most of the data presented used 150 mil shielding as indicated in Table 4  When other thicknesses, ranging from 150 mils to 400 mils were explored as shown in Table 5 less than a 17% change was observed in the predicted upset rate.  A minor difference between the observed and the predicted number of upsets for the majority of the programs analyzed indicates that the models are relatively accurate in predicting upset rates even after the SV and shielding assumptions were explored.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
