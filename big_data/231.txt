so the techniques for analysis and discovery of useful information are impor tant The information providers and web manager make an effort to construct the effective web site If providers and administrators can determine users\222 browsing par terns from web access logs, they would be able to use the patterns as one index to construct an effective site However it is difficult to extract users\222 browsing pat terns manually because the web access log is huge Therefore we adopt data mining technique to this prob

can determinc users\222 browsing pat terns from web access logs, they could use the patterns as one index to cnnstruct an effective site However it is difficult to extract users\222 browsing patterns manually because the web access log is huge Therefore we adopt data mining technique to this problem and design the log summarizing agent This agent can automatically get profitable information from large amounts of web access logs The data mining is to cxtract patterns from large amounts of data It is useful 
for extracting item patterns of customers in the supermarket store For ex ample, the person buying beer buys cheese, too It also have success to domains such as a marketing strategy manufacture, and medical treatment We deal with the web mining domain This is one of the applications for data mining techniques Basically there are two domains in the web  web con tent mining and web usage mining The former is to ex tract knowledge from the content of Web sites, whereas the latter is the web log mining and extracting interest ing patterns from web access 
logs In this paper section 2 explains our appcoach to web access logs mining section 3 shows how to analize web access logs section 4 describes Log Analysis System section 5 provides some exprimental results and finally section concludes this paper 2 Approach for web access log min ing In this paper we design of log summerizing agent. This agent extracts browsing patterns and it is classified by user access domain 
in web access logs If web adminis trators can get the browsing pattern they would be able to contruct the effetive site The purpuse of access to the web site is difference amoung the visitors For example of the unversity site the purpose of the student is to know about curriculums in contrast the purpose of the developer is to know about new technologies. Therefore we categorize users by access domain such as 223ac\224 domain \(education\and 224CO\224 domain \(enterprise In 
order to extract the access patterns, we use Apriori alogrithml I J[2][31[4][6 Apri ori alogrithm is one of extract association rule tecnique in data mining The algorithm can get some relations between items in transaction database The alogorithm is as follows 1 Input  Database D Lf iransaciions minimum support threshold iniii-sup 2 Output  L frequent itemets in D 3 Method 0-7803-7078-3/0u$l0.00 C E Page 2642

major work is to find peculiar data in multiple relations for a given discovery task while foreign link relationships ex ist In other words our task is to select n relations which contain the peculiar data among m relations m 2 n with foreign links The method for selecting n relations among m relations can be divided into the following steps Step 1 Focus on a relation as the main table and find the peculiar data from this table Then elicit the peculiar ity rules from the peculiar data by using the methods stated in Section 4 Step 2 Find the value\(s of the focused key correspond ing to the mined peculiarity rule or peculiar data in Step 1 and change its granularity of the value\(s of the focused key if the background knowledge on informa tion granularity is available Step 3 Find the peculiar data in the other relations or databases\corresponding to the value or its granule of the focused key Step 4 Select n relations that contain the peculiar data among m relations m 2 n In other words we just select the relations that contain peculiar data relevant to the peculiarity rule mined from the main table A peculiarity rule can be discovered from peculiar data hidden in multiple relations by searching the relevance among the peculiar data If the peculiar data X\(x and Y\(y are found in two different relations we need to use a value or its granule in a key or foreign key/link as the relevance factor K\(lc to find the relevance between X\(z and Y\(y Thus the relevance between X\(z and Y\(y is evaluated by R2  Pl\(K\(lc z K\(lc Y 13 Region Yamaguchi    Furthermore, the above-stated methodology can be ex tended for mining from multiple databases A chal lenge in multi-database mining is a semantic heterogene ity among multiple databases because usually no explicit foreign key/link relationships exists among them Hence the key issue of the extension is how to findkreate the rel evance among different databases In our methodology we use granular computing techniques based on semantics, ap proximation and abstraction for solving the issue 8 201 We again use the illustrative example mentioned at Sec tion 2 If a manager of the supermarket found that the turnover was a marked drop in one day from a supermarket sale database he/she may not understand the deeper rea son Although rule1 as a peculiarity rule \(see Section 2 can be discovered from the supermarket-sales database, the deeper reason why the turnover was a marked drop is not explained well However if we search several related in formation sources such as a weather database as shown in Date   I Weather July-I   sunny July-2    cloud Table 5 Weather 1 t  1 July:30 1 t   I typhinino 2 I July-31 cloud     Table 5 we can find that there was a violent typhoon that day Hence we can understand the deeper reason why the turnover was a marked drop For this case, the granule of aa'dx  Ube in Table 1 needs to be changed into region  yamaguchi for creating explicit foreign link between the supermarket-sales database and the weather database. This example will be further described in the next section 5.2 Representation and Re-learning We use the RVER Reverse Variant Entity-Relationship model to represent the peculiar data and the conceptual re lationships among the peculiar data discovered from mul tiple relations databases 23 Figure l as an example shows the results mined from two databases on supermar ket sales at Yamaguchi prefecture and the weather of Japan The point of which the RVER model is different from an ordinary ER model is that we just represent the attributes that are relevant to the peculiar data and the related pecu liar data \(or their granules in the RVER model Thus, the RVER model provides all interesting information that is rel evant to some focusing e.g turnover  very-low region  yamaguchi and date  July-30 in the supermarket-sale database\for learning more interesting rules among multi ple relations \(databases Re-learning means learning more interesting rules from the RVER model For example, the following rule can be learned from the RVER model shown in Figure 1  rule2  weather\(typhoon  turnover very-low We can see that a manager of the supermarket may be more interested in rule2 rather than rulel because rule2 shows a deeper reason why the turnover was a marked drop 6 Concluding Remarks We presented a method of mining peculiarity rules from multiple databases and a formal interpretation and compar ison of three classes of rules association rules exception rules and peculiarity rules We showed that such peculiar ity rules represent a typically unexpected, interesting regu larity hidden in databases Here we should mention that Liu's group systemati cally investigated how to analyze the subjective interesting 572
