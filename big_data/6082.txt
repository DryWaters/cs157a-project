The works we have done generally as follows.

As the results proves that fault diagnosis of industrial boiler based on competitive agglomeration and fuzzy association rules can mining knowledge effectively, and the knowledge has higher correct rate than normal methods The project was supported by National High-tech R&D Program \(863 Program 2007AA041401 Science Foundation \(08JCZDJC18600, 09JCZDJC23900 and University Science and Technology Development Foundation of Tianjin \(2006ZD32 Keywords- competitive agglomeration, fuzzy association rules, fault diagnosis, industrial boiler I. INTRODU CTION 


Industrial boiler is a kind of important equipment in industrial production. Because of the complexity of structure and special running environment, and the design manufacturing, installation, management of the boiler are less of experiences, the normal fault rate is very high, the harmfulness of fault caused serious consequences and great economic losses[l equipment in running time and find out the fault early judge the causes and location of the fault, forecast the tendency of fault. As the fast development of database and automatic technique, monitoring systems are installed in most of the important equipments, which can collect all kinds of data and parameters of running equipment that reflect the state of the equipment, large databases are formed. These data and parameters include all the character of equipment, but the character of data and parameters are not clear and not intuitive [2],[ 3 Datamining is a kind of technique which can extract useful information and knowledge that are unknown prior from a large number of incomplete, noisy, fuzzy or random data Nowadays, datamining has been applied in fault diagnosis by many researchers domestic and overseas, who has achieve success. But the research is still having some 978-1 -4244 -7956-611 0/$26.00 20 10 IEEE 64 shortcomings, such as real-time performance is not good the rules produced are not accurate and so on[4]-[6 Considering the real time and reliability of fault diagnosis this paper proposed a method which is combined by competitive agglomeration and fuzzy association rules This method has a better effect and could produce more accurate association rules, which provide an effective method to diagnosis of industrial boiler II. BRIEF INTRODU CTION OF ALGORITHM The history database of data collection and monitor system include many kinds of data, such as analog input digital input, calculated quantities, pulse input, and so on Every kind of data has large amount of data points, analog input include flow rate of main boiler feed water temperature of main vapor, etc; Digital input include feed water switch, air feeder switch, etc. As the Boolean association rules algorithm is mature day by day, which we 


can use to deal with the digital data. In the case of analog data, we can change them into Boolean data quite naturally[7 dereferencing of quantitative attributes into many intervals which could reflect the real distribution of data effectively A. competitive agglomeration algorithms Competitive agglomeration algorithms have the advantage of both hierarchical clustering and partition clustering, for the different given initial number of class competitive agglomeration algorithms can change the number of class as the iteration process goes. Some poor competitiveness class, which has a smaller base value than given threshold value, will be extinct in the iteration process. Finally, we could get an optimized clustering number, which can reflect the real distribution of data effectively, and quantitative attributes could be discretized into several optimized interval [8 Competitive agglomeration algorithms is a kind of fuzzy clustering, the basic idea of which is to find the center of classes, B = {VI"' v c } , and the fuzzy partition matrix \(u ij L n and so as to minimize the objective function J = It\(uufd2\(xj,vJ-aI[i>ij]2 c 1\(1 < . < 1 In the U E [0 1] L.,uy _I - C, - } - n functIOn, Ij ',I?I , uij called CMCE2010 the degree of objective data Xj belongs to the /h class . m is a fuzzy parameter bigger than 1 ,  using to control the clustering degree, usually valued as 2 .

Fuzzy association rules mining algorithm The quantitative attributes ip"" im can be divided into several fuzzy classes Ip,1m by competitive 65 agglomeration algorithm, which IS recorded asil \(1 1 l From the database T={tj, .. tn } we can create a new database. The different fuzzy class can act as the attribute of the new database. Because the attributes are fuzzy set so we call this attributes as fuzzy attributes. We can use the method below to value the fuzzy attributes of the new database. In the new database, the value of/h attribute on attribute ij \(1 attribute in fuzzy set il \(1 1 + ... +1 I m fuzzy attributes, and n records. We can still 


denote the set formed by all the fuzzy attributes as I, in which all the elements are fuzzy set. All the records formed a set T == ?p'" t J, we can easy to know that the values of fuzzy attributes are belonging to region [0, 1], if the attribute has no value in primary database, in the new database will be remembered as 0[ 9 Fuzzy attribute set X called as the antecedent of fuzzy association rules. The number of fuzzy attribute in Fuzzy attribute set X is called as the length of it. The Fuzzy attribute set has a length of k is called k-fuzzy attribute set Y is the consequent of fuzzy association rules; the attribute's value in fuzzy attribute Yk is t J y J E [0,1 to mining the fuzzy association rules we have to define fuzzy support rate and fuzzy confidence level Definition 1 :  To an arbitrary fuzzy attribute set X == {YP"" Y p } , define the fuzzy support rate of fuzzy attribute set X as FSup\(X 11 p IIT tJ \(yJ FSup\(X In which n is the number of attribute m T n p IITtj\(yJ j?1 m?l is the fuzzy support rate of fuzzy attribute set X, denoted as FSup\(X X given minimum support rate, X can be called as fuzzy frequent attribute set Definition 2 :  The fuzzy support rate of fuzzy association rule X ==> Y defined as FSup 11 p+q I ITtj\(yJ FSup = -,-j_?l_m_ ?_l __ _ n Definition 3 :  the fuzzy confidence level of fuzzy aSSOCIatIOn rule X => Y defined as FCorif Sup FConf We can take two steps to mining fuzzy association rules Find out the entire fuzzy frequent attribute set, that is all the fuzzy attribute sets, the support rate of which is not less than the minimum support rate 


Produce fuzzy association rules from the fuzzy frequent set, the confidence level is not less than the minimum confidence level. Following is the method: To an arbitrary fuzzy frequent attribute set X, arbitrary fuzzy attribute set Y c X if FSupport\(X r association rule r => X - r is a meaningful rule Principle 1: If fuzzy attribute set X is a fuzzy frequent attribute set, then all the nonvoid subsets of it are fuzzy frequent attribute sets P  I 2 If fuz . .

TEST AND CON CLUSION 


Take a industrial boiler as an example, there are 52 attributes in the process history database. In the test we will take 10 attribute which are stand for temperature of main vapor, pressure of main vapor, water level, steam drum pressure, steam drum temperature, etc. The fault is category attribute, A-heating pipe blasting, B-priming, C excessive pressure, D-Iess water in boiler, E-more filled water in boiler.

Interval partition by competitive agglomeration algorithm We will use competitive agglomeration algorithm to divide the quantity attribute in the industrial boiler history database. First discretize the quantitative attributes into several optimize intervals, take the main vapor pressure as an example, collect all the data to form a data set X, apply the competitive agglomeration algorithm to cluster X, then we can get partition matrix U and the center of classes vi the row element of U is the degree of membership of the element in X. according to the maximum degree of membership principle, the element in X will be clustered into c classes, take the minimum element as the left end point and the maximum element as the right end point, in this way, the quantitative attributes are discretized into c optimize partitions. Inlikemanner we can discretize the other 9 quantitative attributes, the number of optimize partition are 5 ,  4 ,  4 ,5 ,5 ,6,4 ,5 ,4 respectively.

Compare each center Vi, decide the fuzzy class by the size of center the bigger center match along with a bigger fuzzy class Set f.1k \(x h fuzzy set, the method to express fuzzy set as triangular fuzzy number as follows S X k = {xi:.uk \(xi the minimum point in X k u v k by the ambilateral of class center Vk, set the minimum point on the left side is Xl, the membership degree is .uk \(Xl right side is x" the membership degree is .uk \(X triangular fuzzy number f\(x h fuzzy set can expressed as follows f\(x x-a --- ,a=s;x=s;vk vk -a b-x -- ,Vk <x=s;b b-vk O,X < aorx >b Create fuzzy set at every center of class; s% overlap is permitted at the border upon fuzzy set. Considering the Vi centered clustering fuzzy set, the supremum and infimum of support can be defined as ni and mi mi= vi+O.55\(l+s Vi-r Vi l+s Vi-Vi_l In view of above, we can structure the membership degree function, as Figure 1 shows below o Figure 1.

Analysis of experiment Result From Table 3 ,  we can conclude: most of the rules mined by fuzzy association rules algorithm can reflect the relevance between the attributes and faults in the industrial boiler system. The result of experiment shows that the algorithm is of high preciseness for mining rules 67 IV. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY In this paper, competitive agglomeration and fuzzy association rules are applied in fault diagnosis at the same time, the result with the requirements for diagnosis correctness.

This means that the dependency between education and wage is proven One problem remains: the given result is global and we are interested in a local diagnostic to indicate the cells that contribute the most in the 2.

V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables
