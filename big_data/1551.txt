Stankovic\nDepartment of Computer Science\nUniversity of Virginia USA\nstankovic@cs.virginia.edu\nAbstract—Carpooling taxicab services hold the promise of\nproviding additional transportation supply, especially in ex-\ntreme weather or rush hour when regular taxicab services are\ninsuf?cient. Although many recommendation systems about\nregular taxicab services have been proposed recently, little re-\nsearch, if any, has been done to assist passengers to ?nd a\nsuccessful taxicab ride with carpooling. In this paper, we\npresent the ?rst systematic work to design a uni?ed recommen-\ndation system for both regular and carpooling services, called\nCallCab, based on a data driven approach. In response to a\npassenger’s request, CallCab aims to recommend either \(i detour, or \(ii detour, yet without assuming any\nknowledge of destinations of passengers already on occupied\ntaxicabs. To analyze these unknown destinations of occupied\ntaxicabs, CallCab generates and re?nes taxicab trip distribu-\ntions based on GPS datasets and context information collected\nin the existing taxicab infrastructure. To improve CallCab’s ef-\n?ciency to process such a big dataset, we augment the ef?cient\nMapReduce model with a Measure phase tailored for our ap-\nplication. We evaluate CallCab with a real world dataset of\n14, 000 taxicabs, and results show that compared to ground\ntruth, CallCab can reduce 64% of the total mileage to deliver\nall passengers and 63% of passenger’s waiting time.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAmong all transportation modes, taxicabs play a promi-\nnent role in residents’ daily commutes in metropolitan\nareas [1 e.g., in New York City [2], over 100 companies\noperate more than 13, 000 taxicabs with a daily demand of\n660 000 passengers. But regular taxicab services are very in-\nsuf?cient during extreme weather or rush hour in big cities,\ne.g., New York City and Beijing, where the average waiting\ntime for a taxicab in rush hour is more than 30 minutes [1].\nTo address such an issue, carpooling taxicab services are\nproposed in some taxicab networks to provide additional\ntransportation supply, yet with the same number of taxicabs.\nIn a carpooling service, a passenger can hail an occupied\ntaxicab on streets or wait at a taxicab stand to carpool.\nHowever different from well known regular taxicab ser-\nvices where any vacant taxicab can take a passenger to any\nreasonable direction, in a carpooling taxicab service, a new\npassenger has to ?nd a carpoolable taxicab which refers to\nan occupied taxicab with the existing passengers heading to\nthe similar direction \(no need to be the same destination may not consider a taxicab with ex-\nisting passengers heading to the west as a carpoolable\nProf. Tian He is the corresponding author of this paper.\ntaxicab, since according to “First Come, First Served” policy,\nthere will be a long distance detour for this new passenger.\nSo when vacant taxicabs are not available, a key question for\na passenger is how to ?nd a carpoolable taxicab?\nUnfortunately, almost all taxicab recommendation system-\ns [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] are focused on how to ?nd a vacant\ntaxicab. Little work, if any, is focused on how to ?nd a car-\npoolable taxicab for a passenger. More importantly, how to\n?nd a carpoolable taxicab cannot be addressed by con?gur-\ning the existing solutions for ?nding a vacant taxicab. This is\nbecause for a particular new passenger, a recommendation\nsystem can recommend any vacant taxicab in a regular ser-\nvice; but in a carpooling service, it has to recommend a\nparticular carpoolable taxicab heading to the similar direc-\ntion with this new passenger. This is challenging because in\nthe existing taxicab infrastructure, even with the real-time\ntaxicab GPS tracking, a recommendation system cannot\nknow future directions of occupied taxicabs, since the desti-\nnations of passengers on these occupied taxicabs are\nunknown, until the passengers are dropped off. A straightfor-\nward yet trivial solution is to let drivers log passengers’\ndestinations right after passengers enter taxicabs. But such a\nsystem is not feasible in the real world, since it requires an\ninfrastructure upgrade with hardware for drivers to manually\ninput destinations, which can be potential hindrances in\nterms of both cost and ef?ciency. So it is challenging to as-\nsist a speci?c passenger to ?nd a carpoolable taxicab in the\nexisting infrastructure, when no vacant taxicabs are available.\nIn this paper, we argue that a data driven approach is a\npromising solution to address such an issue. In the existing\ntaxicab infrastructure of big cities, taxicab’s location and sta-\ntus are uploaded to a dispatching center periodically \(e.g., 2\nrecords/minute several TBs 1TB per\nyear the networks. More importantly, from this\ndataset, we can draw taxicab trip distributions to analyze an\noccupied taxicab’s destination \(thus future directions taxicab has\nalready passed, time of day, or day of week, etc. These dis-\ntributions enable a recommendation 


system to assist\npassengers to ?nd carpoolable taxicabs.\nAdmittedly, dispatching taxicabs or informing passengers\nbased on GPS datasets is not a new method. But existing\ndispatching or recommendation systems assume that only va-\ncant taxicabs can pick up passengers, and little research, if\nany, has been done on carpooling taxicab services. In this\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 439\n2work, we conduct the ?rst effort to propose a uni?ed recom-\nmendation system for both CArpooLing and reguLar\ntaxiCAB services, called CallCab, based on both GPS\ndatasets and context information collected in the existing in-\nfrastructure. But dealing with such a big dataset \(in terms of\nhigh volume and velocity, yet with raw unstructured format and processing model. In this pa-\nper, we are inspired by the ef?cient MapReduce model [8]\nproposed by Google to handle large datasets, and augment it\nwith a new Measure phase for our application. Speci?cally,\nthe key contributions of this paper are as follows:\n• To the best of our knowledge, we conduct the ?rst work\nthat recommends either a vacant or a carpoolable taxi-\ncab \(an occupied taxicab heading the similar direction responds to a passenger’s request with a uni?ed\nmethod, and provide a comprehensive study of how to\nanalyze occupied taxicabs’ routes without destinations\nof their passengers for large-scale taxicab networks.\n• To achieve our goal, we propose CallCab, which mines\ntaxicab trip distributions from historical and real-time\nGPS datasets collected in the existing taxicab infrastruc-\nture without extra costs. Then, according to these trip\ndistributions conditioning on collected context informa-\ntion \(e.g., the last pickup locations and current locations\nof nearby taxicabs, time of day, day of week, etc recommends either a\nvacant taxicab for a direct route \(no detour distance carpool route \(small detour\ndistance potential taxicabs.\n• To quantify the similarity between directions, we propose\na novel metric called Detour Ratio, which is shown as\na ratio between a particular passenger’s detour distance\nand the distance of the direct route. This detour ratio\nuni?es recommendations for both regular services \(with\ndetour ratios equal to 0 with\ndetour ratios larger than 0 either vacant or occupied datasets for detour ratio cal-\nculation, we propose a generic MapReduceMeasure\nmodel, inspired by MapReduce This model provides 3\nkinds of abstractions to hide details of data processing,\nand can be used for various applications.\nOur evaluation effort is comprehensive. We test CallCab on\na real world dataset consisting of GPS records from more than\n14, 000 taxicabs in a big metropolitan area with a population\nof more than 10 million. The results show that compared with\nground truth, CallCab can reduce 64% of the total mileage\nand reduce 63% of passenger waiting time, simultaneously.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II\nintroduces the related work. Section III presents the existing\ninfrastructure. Section IV proposes our main idea. Section V\ndepicts our MapReduceMeasure model. Section VI de-\nscribes our detailed design. Section VII validates our design\nwith datasets, followed by the conclusion in Section VIII.\nII. RELATED WORK\nThe concept of carpooling taxicab services is not brand\nnew, but in the real world it is normally negotiated privately\nby drivers and passengers in an ad hoc manner, when vacant\ntaxicabs are not available. We lack a systematic design for a\nuni?ed recommendation for both regular and carpooling taxi-\ncab services. Two types of previous work related to our work\nare introduced as follows.\nA. Regular Taxicab Services\nDue to the increasing availability of GPS devices on taxi-\ncabs, taxicab GPS records have been employed by several\nsystems to improve the ef?ciency of regular taxicab services.\nFor example, taxicab GPS records are able to help taxicab\noperators better oversee taxicabs and provide timely services\nto passengers, e.g., discovering temporal and spatial causal\ninteractions to provide timely and ef?cient services in certain\nareas with disequilibrium [6] [7], and detecting anomalous\ntaxicab trips to discover driver fraud or road network\nchanges 9]. In addition to taxicab operators, several systems\nare proposed for the bene?t of passengers or drivers e.g., al-\nlowing taxicab passengers to query the expected duration\nand fare of a planed trip based on previous trips [3] and\nquery real-time taxicab availability to make informed trans-\nportation choices [4], and recommending optimal pickup\nlocations or routes [5]. Moveover, taxicab GPS records can\nhelp beyond the taxicab business: \(i improve their driving performance [10]; \(ii smart\nroutes based on those of experienced taxicab drivers [11];\n\(iii us to better under-\nstand traf?c conditions of cities [12]. Yet existing research\non taxicab systems are focused on vacant taxicabs, assuming\nthat one taxicab can accommodate only a single delivery re-\nquest at a time. In contrast, our recommendation system\naims for both vacant and occupied taxicabs. Technically, we\nfocus on recommending a taxicab ride \(vacant or occupied 


has\nnot been investigated before.\nB. Ad Hoc Carpooling Taxicab Services\nCurrently, carpooling taxicab services exist in both devel-\noped and developing countries in an ad hoc fashion. For\nexample, in Beijing, ad hoc taxicab carpooling is allowed\nwith the consent of both passengers and drivers, and every\npassenger pays 60% of the regular fare. In New York City,\nup to four passengers can carpool together in a single taxi-\ncab ride during 6 AM to 10 AM on a weekday, along three\npreset routes in Manhattan at a ?at fare of $3 or $4 per pas-\nsenger, signi?cantly less than the regular metered rates [13].\nHowever, in the aforementioned services both time and loca-\ntions are preset in a small-scale ad hoc manner, and no\nsystematic method under the existing infrastructure is\nprovided to improve the ef?ciency of carpooling.\n440\n3III. EXISTING TAXICAB INFRASTRUCTURE\nIn this section, we introduce the existing taxicab infras-\ntructure and discuss semantics data mined from a big dataset\ncollected in this infrastructure.\nA. Infrastructure Description\nIn the existing taxicab networks of large cities, e.g., New\nYork City, Beijing, and Shenzhen, taxicabs are equipped\nwith GPS and communication devices, in addition to fare\nmeters. To monitor global status of all taxicabs dispatching\ncenters with cloud servers are also established in most taxi-\ncab networks. Thus, as shown in Figure 1, the existing\ntaxicab infrastructure typically consists of two parts: taxicabs\nin the frontend dispatching centers in the backend.\nCell Tower\nCell Tower\nDispatching Center\nCloud Server\nGPS \nRecords\nCell Tower\nFig 1: Existing Infrastructure\nIn such an infrastructure, \(i physical status, e.g., current location, direction,\netc; \(ii status\nat any time, i.e., with passengers or not; \(iii logical status are uploaded\nperiodically to dispatching centers via cell towers, in terms\nof a GPS record which mainly consists of the following pa-\nrameters: Plate Number; Date and Time; GPS Coordinates;\nStatus Bit with passengers or not when this record is up-\nloaded. Thus, a large GPS dataset is stored in cloud servers\nof dispatching centers for analysis. Figure 2 gives statistics\nabout such a GPS dataset of a Chinese city Shenzhen with\n10 million population.\nCollection Period 6 Months \nCollection Date 01/01-06/30\n# of Taxicabs 14,453\n# of Pickup Events 98,472,628\n# of GPS records 3.9 Billion\nUploading Speed 2 Records/mins\nGPS Dataset Summary\nFig 2: Dataset Summary Fig 3: Origins & Destinations\nAs shown in Figure 2, a half-year dataset contains almost\nfour billion GPS records. Such a raw large dataset has a very\nhigh resolution, which can be used to locate a particular\ntaxicab at ?ne-granularity in terms of both time and space.\nBut such a ne-granular large GPS dataset has many records\nof no interest, and such a raw GPS dataset is not in a format\nready for analysis. In the next subsection, we data mine\nsome semantics from this large ?ne-granular raw dataset,\nwhich is used to reduce the resolution \(smaller yet compact\nsize produce logical concepts, i.e.,\ntrips, for our system design in Section V.\nB. Semantics in Existing Infrastructure\nBased on the historical and real-time GPS records, we\nseparate individual trips from the entire dataset by continu-\nously observing the change of Status Bit on GPS records of\nthe same taxicab. If a Status Bit turns to 1 from 0 in two\nconsecutive records of a taxicab, then it indicates that this\ntaxicab just picked up a passenger in the location indicated\nby the GPS coordinates, which is considered as an origin or\na pickup location of a trip; if a Status Bit turns to 0 from 1,\nthen it indicates that this taxicab just droped off a passenger\nat the location considered as a destination or a dropoff loca-\ntion of a trip. Figure 3 gives examples of origins and\ndestinations. A GPS record set consisting of visited locations\nbetween an origin and its corresponding destination is\nconsidered as a trip, which is the key unit of our design.\nVisiting Locations nwith No Passengers\nVisiting Locations \nwith Passengers\nOrigins of \nTrips\nDestinations \nof Trips\nL1L2\nL3\nL4 L5\nL6L7L8\nFig 4: Taxicab Trips\nFigure 4 gives examples of a trip, based on a recreated scenario\nin an aerial map according to GPS records. A taxicab starts\nwith no passengers at location L1, and picks up a passenger\nbetween L2 and L3 \(the GPS record uploaded in L2 indicates\nno passengers in this taxicab, while the GPS record uploaded\nin L3 indicates a passenger in this taxicab L5, and picks up a new passenger\nbetween L6 and L7, and ?nally leaves the map at L8. Thus,\na complete trip is given from L3 to L5.\nGiven the semantics data mined from the real-time GPS\ndataset, the existing recommendation systems can easily locate\nand recommend a vacant taxicab to new passengers based on\ntheir locations. But if no nearby vacant taxicab is available,\nthe existing recommendation systems cannot recommend an\noccupied taxicab for a carpooling service, since destinations\nof existing passengers on occupied taxicabs are unknown, and\nthus they fail to recommend a carpoolable taxicab heading in\na similar direction as the new passenger.\nBut the large GPS dataset and context information provide\nis an opportunity to analyze the future directions of occupied\ntaxicabs without destinations of passengers already in these\ntaxicabs, and thus to locate carpoolable taxicabs, which is\nintroduced in the next section.\nIV. MAIN IDEA\nOur CallCab aims for both regular and carpooling taxicab\nservices. Since regular services are commonly understood, we\ngive an example of 


a scenario where carpooling services are\napplied, and then present the main idea of CallCab.\n441\n4T1\nP\nT2\n nKnown Location Unknown Location\nI1\nI2\nI0\nI4\nI3\nI5\nFig 5: Taxicab Operating Scenario\nA. Taxicab Carpooling Scenario\nFigure 5 gives a scenario where a passenger P is waiting\nat origin I0 and heading to destination I5 Under the existing\ninfrastructure, P provides a request with origin I0 and desti-\nnation I5 to a recommendation system for a taxicab. Based\non real-time GPS records, a recommendation system cannot\n?nd an available vacant taxicab, but can locate two nearby\noccupied taxicabs T1 and T2 that will pass P ’s origin I0\nsoon, as potential carpoolable taxicabs.\nTo recommend T1 or T2 to P , a recommendation system\nhas to analyze actual traveling distance for P to be carpooled\ninto T1 or T2. For example, if carpooled into T1 at origin I0,\nP ?rst has to be “involuntarily” taken to a location I3 \(which\nis unknown destination of existing passengers on T1 Served” policy. Thus, the actual traveling\ndistance for P to be carpooled into T1 is the distance carpool route, i.e., |I0 ? I3| + |I3 ? I5|, instead of a di-\nrect route with a direct distance of |I0 ? I5 The difference\nbetween the carpool route and the direct route leads to a de-\ntour distance of \(|I0 ? I3| + |I3 I5 ndetour distance\ndirect distance to show the utility of\na passenger P being carpooled into a taxicab T1 Different\noccupied taxicabs passing I0 have different destinations,\nleading to different detour ratios for P to carpool. One of\nthe optimal carpooling strategies for P is to select a taxicab\nwith the smallest detour ratio as the carpoolable taxicab.\nHowever, only the origins of passengers on T1 or T2 \(i.e.,\nI1 or I2 known for the recommendation system, and\ntheir destinations \(i.e., I3 or I4 existing infrastructure. Therefore, the recommendation\nsystem cannot calculate detour ratios, thus failing to\nrecommend a taxicab with a smaller detour ratio to P .\nBut in the existing infrastructure, although destinations are\nunknown during the trip, destinations are stored in terms of\nGPS records, after passengers are dropped off. These histori-\ncal destinations and collected real-time context information\nis used to analyze unknown destinations of existing passen-\ngers in taxicabs, and thus to analyze detour ratios for a\nparticular new passenger to carpool with these existing\npassengers in taxicabs. The details are given next.\nB. Main Idea\nThe main idea of CallCab is shown in Figure 6.\n1 records for all\ntaxicabs are stored as a big dataset. Thus, inferred from GPS\nrecords, destinations and corresponding origins comprise nu-\nmerous trips, which are used to construct trip distributions.\nSuch distributions can generate destinations of trips that start\nat a particular origin and pass a particular location.\nTrip \nDistributionsGPS dataset\nExpected Detour \nRatio Calculations\nOnline \nRecommendations\nPassenger Request \n\(Origin, Destination Current Locations, Time of Day, Day of Week Idea\n2 distributions\nto calculate an Expected Detour Ratio ?PT1 for P to carpool\nwith a particular nearby taxicab T1 according to a basic and\nan advanced design. In both basic and advanced design,\nbased on trip distributions CallCab \(i DST1 includes all destinations\nassociated to the origin of existing passengers on T1; this o-\nrigin is obtained by T1’s last pickup locations ii iii destinations in reduced\nDST1 to calculate a weighted average ?\nP\nT1\n.

CallCab ?rst obtains shortest paths\nbetween I1 to all destinations in DST1 from the dataset. Then,\na destination Ii is eliminated from DST1 , if the shortest path\nfrom I1 to Ii does not include I0. For example, CallCab\neliminates I2 from DST1 , since the shortest path from I1 to\nI2 does not include I0 in the normal situation; i.e., a normal\ntrip starting at I1 and passing I0 is not the shortest trip from I1\nto I2, so I2 is not a potential destination for a trip starting at I1\nand passing I0. \(iii probabilities \(i.e., 33 by their locations.\nAdvanced Design: The advanced design is built upon the\nbasic design. However, in the advanced design, \(i the basic design, e.g., CallCab can e-\nliminate I5 from DST1 , if I5 has never been a destination\nfor a trip at the current time of day and day of week. \(ii I3\nand I4 as in the basic design, CallCab assigns probabilities\nto I3 and I4 based on their frequencies in 


distributions to\nmore accurately calculate ?PT1 in the advanced design, e.g., if\namong six trips starting from I1 in the distribution, four of\nthem have I3 as their destination, while others have I4 as\ntheir destination then CallCab assigns Pr\(I3 I4 basic design conditions trip distribu-\ntions on only limited context information, e.g., origin and\n442\n5current locations of taxicabs, while the advanced design fur-\nther considers richer context information, e.g., popularity of\ndestinations, time of day, day of week, etc.\n3 analyzing the detour\nratio for every nearby taxicab, CallCab recommends a taxi-\ncab with the minimum expected detour ratio \(either a vacant\ntaxicab with 0 detour ratio or an occupied taxicab with a\nsmall detour ratio for this passenger. Based on updated con-\ntext information, e.g., taxicab current location this\nrecommendation can be constantly updated.\nC. Opportunity for MapRduce in CallCab Design\nThe key step of CallCab is how to obtain trip distributions\nbased on raw GPS datasets. However, the raw GPS dataset\nshows physical aspects of taxicabs, while our design is focused\non logical concepts, e.g., trips, which are not directly given in\nraw datasets. Further, the raw GPS dataset typically has a large\nvolume and interconnects multi-dimensional GPS records with\nhigh resolution, so though detailed enough, much of the raw\ndataset is of no interest in our design.\nThe above features ?t the common understanding of big\ndata [14]. To tackle this big dataset regarding these features,\nwe need to map this raw physical GPS dataset to a ?ltered\nand compressed logical dataset \(e.g., trips physical\nGPS dataset to a compacted size with only interesting data\n\(e.g., trips including a particular intersection  and augment it by an additional\nMeasure phase to present a generic MapReduceMeasure\nmodel, which can be used independently from our design. In\nSection V and VI, employing the recommendation system as\na showcase, we demonstrate how to use our model to tackle\na big dataset that is not in a format ready for analysis.\nV MapReduceMeasure MODEL\nIn this section, we ?rst introduce the basic yet generic\nMapReduceMeasure model, and present some preliminar-\nies for our speci?c application, and de?ne Map, Reduce,\nand Measure operations tailored for our application.\nA. MapReduceMeasure Introduction\nOur MapReduceMeasure model is mainly based on\nMapReduce, which is proposed as a generic design and\nprogramming model for processing and generating large\ndatasets. MapReduce has two key operations: Map and\nReduce. A dataset user speci?es a Map operation that takes\nkey/value pairs as input to generate a set of intermediate\nkey/value pairs, and a Reduce operation that takes all inter-\nmediate values associated with the same intermediate keys as\ninputs to generate a set of output values.\nThough suf?ciently generic to perform many real world\ntasks, the two-phase MapReduce model is best at generat-\ning a set of values based on the same key. The impact of one\nkey on the values generated by another key is dif?cult to e-\nvaluate in the current model. In this work, we propose a\nthird phase Measure and it measures the impact of one key\non the values generated by another key, and outputs a new\nvalue as a metric to show the impact. The generic types of\nMapReduceMeasure model is given as follows.\nMap : \(key1 value1  key2, Set[value2  key3, Set[value2 value3.\nB. Preliminaries\nTo convert the raw GPS dataset into a format ready for\nour model, we propose a mathematical concept, the Carpool\nGraph, and convert a set of raw GPS records into a logical\ntrip record based on the carpool graph.\n1 segment between intersections.\nTherefore, we de?ne a carpool graph as a simple graph\nwhere vertices represent intersections and edges represent\nroad segments between adjacent intersections. Figure 8\nshows a carpool graph created by a given road map.\nI2 I3 I5\nI4 I7\nI6\nI1\nI5 I6I3I2\nI4 I7I1\nFig 8: Carpool Graph\n2 Conversion: A set of raw GPS records\nbelonging to a single logical trip is identi?ed by several key\nGPS records, indicating the origin, the visited locations, and\nthe destination. How to identify them is mentioned in Sec-\ntion III. Based on the set of GPS records belonging to a\nsingle logical trip, we create a trip record to capture the key\ninformation about this trip, e.g., the origin, the destination,\nthe intersections passed the time and date.\nVisiting Locations Origin Destination\nI2 I3 I4\nI1\nI5\nCarpool Graph\nFig 9: a Trip Record Based on a Carpool Graph\nBased on a carpool graph, Figure 9 shows how to convert\n25 raw GPS records to a trip record. Masks on Taxicab\nNumber and coordinates are for privacy concerns. 25 GPS\nrecords describe the detailed trajectory of a trip, which can\nbe mapped on a given road map, corresponding to an unique\ncarpool graph. Thus a trajectory is represented by a series of\ncarpool graph’s vertices, indicating intersections this trip\nwent through, e.g., intersection I2, I3, and I4. We also add\ntwo intersections I1 and I5 near to the origin and the desti-\nnation to complete the representation as in the ?gure. By the\nsimilar preprocessing, we convert the entire GPS dataset to a\nnew trip record dataset as inputs for our model.\n443\n6\nTABLE I.

Model Operations\nVia the trip record dataset obtained in the last subsection,\nwe propose Map, Reduce, and Measure operations.\n1 containing new\nkeys \(e.g., a speci?c intersection, time of day, or day of\nweek these new keys \(e.g., a\ntrip includes this speci?c intersection, or a trip starts at a\nspeci?c time of day or day of week of\n[key=intersection, value=trip] pairs, e.g., [I1, Trip#1] where\nTrip#1 includes intersection I1. Note that multiple keys are\npaired with the same value, e.g., I2 is also paired with\nTrip#1.

Note that if\nTi is a vacant taxicab, both operations return 0 as the detour\nratio since no detour is needed for a vacant taxicab.\nVI. CallCab DESIGN\nIn this section, based on the model we proposed in the last\nsection, we present the detailed CallCab design for a uni?ed\nrecommendation for both vacant and occupied taxicabs.\nA. Trip Distributions\nWe envision a scenario where in the existing infrastruc-\nture, CallCab maintains trip distributions based on GPS\nrecords that a dispatching center received. By our Map op-\nerations in the model we generate different trip distributions\nfor a particular intersection, time of day, or day of week.

Expected Detour Ratio Calculations\nWhen a passenger P wants to ?nd a taxicab, P makes a\nrequest with the Origin IPO and the Destination I\nP\nD to CallCab.\nBased on IPO and real-time GPS records, CallCab collects the\nfollowing context information.\n• Time of Day TD and Day of Week DW : We consider\nboth Time of Day \(in terms of hourly windows and Day\nof Week \(in terms of SUN, MON, TUS, ..., and SAT previous\nwork that taxicab trips are highly patterned in terms of\nTime of Day and Day of Week [3]. For example, a trip\ndistribution for 8AM on one Monday is very similar to\na trip distribution for 8AM on another Monday, but it\nmay be signi?cantly different from a trip distribution for\n11PM on a Sunday.\n• Nearby Taxicab Set T : As potential taxicab candidates,\nT is a set of taxicabs \(either vacant or occupied origin IPO , within a recommendation radius R\nT to\nIPO \(e.g., 100 meters real-time GPS records, CallCab can further obtain\n\(i i.e., the Origin of existing\npassengers on Ti ii nBased on the above context information, CallCab can gener-\nate several particular distributions by model operations.\nThese distributions are used to calculate an expected detour\nratio for P to be carpooled into any

Further, CallCab marks all n-\nearby taxicabs with ? on the carpool graph sent back to the\npassenger’s mobile device. We envision that a passenger fol-\nlows this carpool graph to hail the recommended taxicab.\nDuring this process, some context information, e.g., the pas-\nsenger’s location or the nearby taxicabs’ current locations,\nwill be changed which may change detour ratios of recom-\nmended taxicabs. Therefore, CallCab updates this carpool\ngraph based on the updated information, until the passenger\nis moving together with a taxicab, which indicates this\npassenger has already found a ride.\nVII. CallCab EVALUATION\nWe draw a sample dataset from the entire dataset introduced\nin Section III to test CallCab. This sample dataset includes\none week of GPS records of more than 14, 000 taxicabs. Due\nto the large size of the datasets, we mainly found two kinds\nof errors. \(i Location Error: GPS coordinates indicate that a\ntaxicab is off the road. \(ii of\nGPS records are missing. The errors may result from different\ncauses, e.g., GPS device malfunctions software issues, etc. We\nperform a simple preprocessing to clean the datasets to rule\nout taxicabs with more than 10% of missing or errant records.\nA. Evaluation Overview\nWe compare two versions of CallCab, Basic and\nAdvanced, against a Random and a Heuristic recommenda-\ntion. Based on GPS datasets, we also obtain trip records\nwhich show the real passenger requests. Then, we use the\nrequests that happened in the dataset of one day as future re-\nquests to test CallCab. Based on a trip record such as\n[pickup time, origin, dropoff time destination] in the dataset,\nwe generate a passenger request [request time=pickup time,\norigin, destination According to the request, all systems\n?rst locate a nearby taxicab set T where taxicabs are within\nRT radius to the origin, based on traces of taxicabs in the\ndataset for a particular day. If there are vacant taxicabs in T ,\nall schemes recommend the closest vacant taxicab to passen-\ngers. Otherwise, \(i of taxicabs in\nT at random; \(ii iii calculates the expected de-\ntour ratio for every taxicab in T based on the basic design in\nSection VI-B1, and then recommends the taxicab with the\nminimum expected detour ratio; \(iv that it calculates the detour ratio based on the\nadvanced design in Section VI-B2.\nSeveral metrics are proposed to show system performance.\nWe use Actual Detour Ratio as a key metric to show the\nef?ciency, which is obtained by actual travel distance?direct distancedirect distance ,\nand given a speci?c recommended taxicab, this metric can be\ncalculated by the same method as in Section IV-A.\nFurther, we investigate Percentage of Reduced Mileage.\nDifferent from the ?rst metric focusing the bene?t of an in-\ndividual passenger, this metric is used to evaluate how much\nthe total mileage can be reduced \(leading to less gas con-\nsumption and less traf?c congestion for passen-\ngers. Assuming M is the total mileage used to deliver all\npassengers separately \(i.e., only regular services with vacant\ntaxicabs vacant or occupied taxicabs recom-\nmended by a speci?c system, then the percentage of reduced\nmileage equals M?mM .\nMore importantly, we justify carpooling services by show-\ning Percentage of Reduced Waiting Time due to\ncarpooling, which has not been investigated before. With car-\npooling, a passenger can signi?cantly reduce the waiting\ntime to take a carpooled taxicab, instead of waiting for a va-\ncant taxicab. But in the current dataset, the actual waiting\ntime for a passenger is not given. However, the upper bound\nof the waiting time is determined by the time that two taxi-\ncabs pass the same pickup location. For example, if a GPS\ndataset shows that \(i and\n\(ii 


passenger, then the\n445\n8upper bound of waiting time for this passenger is ?? . As-\nsuming the actual waiting time is equally distributed from 0\nto ?? , and then we obtain an expected waiting time ??r for\na regular service in the dataset. The waiting time ??c for\ncarpooling is decided by the time when the passenger starts\nto wait \(obtained by ? + ?? ? ??r passenger’s\nlocation \(obtained from the dataset Datasets\non the performance of CallCab, e.g., only one day dataset is\navailable for weekday trip distribution analysis.\nWe evaluate the performance according to the above metrics\nfor different hourly windows for weekdays and weekends, and\nat different radii RT , which determine the size of the nearby\ntaxicab set T . The default setting of RT is 250 meters. For\nboth weekdays and weekends, we use requests from a one day\ndataset and test all systems with traces of taxicabs on other\ndays. The average results are reported.\nB.

During the rush hours of a week-\nday, e.g., 7-10, the average actual detour ratios for all four\nschemes are higher than those of non-rush hours, e.g., 1-7.\nThis is because there are many vacant taxicabs during\nnon-rush hours whereas in rush hours passengers have to\nuse carpooling services, which leads to high actual detour ra-\ntios But the Basic and Advanced solutions outperform\nRandom and Heuristic, which have a high average actual de-\ntour ratios during rush hours, i.e., 60% and 55%. Advanced\noutperforms Basic by 25% on average during rush hours, in-\ndicating that the probability considering frequency in\nAdvanced leads to a better performance.\n2 Weekend Detour Ratio: Figure 12 gives the average ac-\ntual detour ratios in different one hour time windows for two\nweekends. During rush hours of a weekend, e.g., 10-21, the\naverage actual detour ratios for Basic and Advanced are\nmuch lower than those of Random and Heuristic. This is be-\ncause during rush hours, Random and Heuristic recommend\nmore occupied taxicabs with long detours to passengers ac-\ncording to their recommendation methods. But both versions\nof CallCab utilize the trip distribution to recommend occu-\npied taxicabs with less expected detour ratios, so it leads to a\nlower actual detour ratio. During rush hours, Advanced out-\nperforms Basic by 34%, indicating that with more carpool\nopportunities during rush hours, Advanced more accurately\nassigns probabilities for every potential destination for\nrecommendations of corresponding taxicabs.\nC. Percentage of Reduced Mileage\nIn this subsection, we investigate CallCab’s performance\nvia the percentage of the reduced total mileage.\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n%\nof\nR\ned\nuc\ned\nT\not\nal\nM\nile\nag\ne\n\(%\n Day\nRandom\nHeuristic\nBasic-CallCab\nAdvanced-CallCab\nFig 13: Mileage in Weekday\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nRandom\nHeuristic\nBasic-CallCab\nAdvanced-CallCab\n24 Hours of a Day\n%\nof\nR\ned\nuc\ned\nT\not\nal\nM\nile\nag\ne\n\(%\n shows the per-\ncentage of reduced mileage in different one hour time slots\nfor ?ve weekdays.

But Basic\nand Advanced outperform Random and Heuristic during both\nrush hours and non-rush hours, which shows the effective-\nness of CallCab.

the effects of different recommendation radii on the\nperformance of the four schemes in terms of the average\nactual detour ratio from 8AM to 9AM of a weekday. We in-\ncrease the recommendation radius from 50 meters to 250\n446\n9meters, which increases the size of potential taxicabs that\ncan be recommended. Heuristic is not affected by such an\nincrease, since it only recommends the closest taxicab. Ran-\ndom is not signi?cantly affected, since it recommends a\ntaxicab based a random selection. But with the increase of\nradius, both Advanced and Basic have better actual detour\nratios, because a large recommendation radius gives them\nmore taxicabs to select for a better recommendation. Also,\nwith the increase of radius, Advanced always outperforms\nBasic, which con?rms our observations in the previous\nsubsections.\n2 Different Radii: Figure 16 shows\nthe effects of different recommendation radii on percentage of\nreduced total mileage from 8-9 of a weekday. With the increase\nof the radius from 50 meters to 250 meters, the performance of\nboth versions of CallCab increases, while those of Random\nand Heuristic stay the same. But when the radius is close to\n250M, the increase for both versions of CallCab slows down,\nwhich is because the radius is large enough to have a suf?cient\nnumber of taxicabs for recommendations, and an even larger\nradius would not help.\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nRandom\nHeuristic\nBasic-CallCab\nAdvanced-CallCab\n%\nof\nR\ned\nuc\ned\nW\nai\ntin\ng nT\nim\ne\n\(%\n 5\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nA\nct\nua\nlD\net\nou\nr\nR\nat\nio\n\(%\n Detour Ratio VS. Dataset\nE. Percentage of Reduced Waiting Time\nIn this subsection, we show the percentage of reduced\nwaiting time due to carpooling in Figure 17. Because the\nmethod we use to calculate waiting time is based on taxicabs\npassing locations of pickup events, we present the percentage\nof reduced waiting time from hours 8 to 20 of a weekday,\ndue to the high densities of taxicabs and pickup events. Dur-\ning rush hours e.g., from 8 to 10 A.M., all systems with\ncarpool services reduce the waiting time by as much as 63%\non average. Heuristic outperforms the rest because it recom-\nmends the closest occupied taxicab for carpooling service,\nand other systems perform similarly to each other. In short,\ncarpooling services can signi?cantly reduce passenger’s\nwaiting time, when regular taxicab services are not suf?cient.\nF. Impact of Insuf?cient Datasets\nIn this subsection, we evaluate CallCab when there is no\nsuf?cient dataset for analysis. Figure 18 shows the perfor-\nmance of CallCab in terms of detour ratio in one rush hour\n8AM to 9AM of a weekday with the maximum recommen-\ndation radius, when one to ?ve days of dataset are used for\nanalysis. We observe that even though with only a dataset of\none day, CallCab still achieves satisfactory performance,\ne.g., Advanced and Basic achieves a 16% and 28% detour\nratio, respectively. When more datasets are available, the\nperformance of both versions of CallCab becomes better.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we analyze, design, and evaluate a recom-\nmendation system CallCab for both carpooling and regular\ntaxicab services in large-scale taxicab networks. CallCab\ndata mines taxicab trip distributions from historical GPS\ndatasets collected in an existing infrastructure, and recom-\nmends either a vacant taxicab with no detour distance or a\ncarpool route with a small detour distance. We employ a\ngeneric MapReduceMeasure model to ef?ciently tackle the\nraw GPS dataset to obtain recommended taxicabs. We verify\nCallCab with a real world dataset of 14, 000 taxicabs, and\nresults show that compared to ground truth, CallCab can\nsave the passenger’s initial wait time and fare, by decreasing\nboth 64% of the total mileage and 63% of the passenger’s\nwaiting time, leading to a faster and affordable service.\nIX.

3. The set of possible\narchitectures is given by the Cartesian product of the ranges\nof values in Table 3 which consists of 3,636 architectures.\n11\nFigure 11. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3b: Prepare explanations\nStakeholder requirements\nFive stakeholder groups or panels were identified for this\nexample, labeled as follows: weather climate, ecosystems,\nwater, and applications. All five panels were initially con-\nsidered equally important; a case with non-uniform weights\nis considered later in the sensitivity analysis. Note that the\npanels’ relative weights could be obtained through a formal\nmethod such as the one proposed by Cameron et al [32].\nThe specific objectives of each panel, as well as their relative\nranking, are provided in Appendix B.\nCapability rules\nNominal instrument capabilities are presented in Appendix\nA. However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters. Below are\na few examples of situations in which data quality is severely\ncompromised due to orbital parameters.\nLighting conditions—Visible and NIR instruments \(namely\nthe corresponding channels of the IR radiometer node because they cannot gather\nenough light.\nImage distortion—Side-looking instruments cannot work at\nlow altitudes because image distortion becomes unaccept-\nable.\nEmergence rules\nEmergent behavior plays a key role in value delivery to\nstakeholders. We describe in this subsection a few examples\nof emergent behavior \(both in science and cost spatial\nresolution soil moisture dataset provided by LRADIO can be\ncombined with the lower accuracy, higher spatial resolution\ndataset provided by LSAR to produce a new high accuracy,\nmedium spatial resolution dataset.\nSample averaging—In any dataset, part of the non-systematic\nerror can be reduced by averaging samples in time or space,\nthus effectively creating a new dataset that trades accuracy\nagainst spatial or temporal resolution.\nLevel-4 data products—A level-4 net carbon ecosystem ex-\nchange dataset can be created from the combination of a\nlevel-3 soil moisture dataset and several ancillary products,\nnamely land surface temperature, vegetation state, and land-\ncover status.\nMultispectral measurements—IR and MW snow and ice cover\ndatasets can be combined to produce new, multispectral, more\naccurate datasets.\nSharing a common dish—The L-band radar and radiometer\ncan share a common antenna thus effectively reducing the\ntotal mass of the system.\nLearning Curve—If several identical satellites are developed\nand fabricated, the marginal cost of the second and subse-\nquent units is lower than the cost of the first unit due to\nlearning.\nResults\nThe set of 3,636 architectures was evaluated using VASSAR.\nThe benefit portion is based on the set of requirements from\nAppendix B. The cost portion is based on the cost model de-\nscribed in Appendix C. The point science scores and lifecycle\ncost estimates for all these architectures are shown on Figure\n12. These numbers are obtained from defuzzyfying the fuzzy\n12\nFigure 12. Expected science vs expected lifecycle cost for\n3,636 architectures \(uniform weights analysis—The main goal of any system architect-\ning tool is to gain insight into the “shape” of the tradespace,\nwhat the main trades are, whether there are families of\narchitectures, and so on. We observe several features just by\nlooking at the tradespace in Figure 12:\n\(1 a science score\nof 0. This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate. An example of the latter is when a side-\nlooking instrument is put at 400km, resulting in a too large\nimage distortion.\n\(2 unresolvable conflicting require-\nments. In this particular case, most of the observations\nrequire a SSO in order to get rid of diurnal variations in radi-\nance. However, a small subset of requirements that concern\noceanography or cryospheric measurements are ideally taken\nin true polar, non-SSO orbits, in order to avoid tidal aliasing\n\(oceanography cryosphere it is impossible to be in a polar\nand SSO orbit simultaneously, some value is going to be lost\nno matter what decision is made.\n\(3 costs. This is a typical behavior in\narchitectural tradespaces, that has its origins in the non-linear\nmapping between capabilities and satisfaction, namely in the\nquantization of satisfaction levels. In other words slightly\ndifferent performances may be perceived as equivalent in\nterms of satisfaction by stakeholders.\nExplanation facility—The explanation facility provides sup-\nport for more advanced analysis of the tradespace. Examples\nof the features of the explanation facility are listed below:\n\(1 The explanation facility provides\ndetailed explanations of the scores of an architecture in text\nformat as required by the user. An example of such informa-\ntion is provided in Table 4.\n\(2 support: The explanation facility\ncan provide information about one or more architectures on\nFigure 13 


Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy results—We emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., “Most” or “Some larger.\nSensitivity Analysis—There are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis. The red line shows the\ncorrespondence between scalar mass and scalar cost through\na parametric relationship embedded in the tool.\n3 merit change\nwhen each variable is changed. Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17. This kind of results can be useful to determine the\noptimal evolution of an architecture, such as in determining\nan optimal descoping option in the event of a downward\nbudget.\n15\nTable 6.

Local search around architecture #669, high-\nlighted on Table 5\n4 CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a methodology to assess the value\nof a system architecture using RBES Such methodology can\nbe used in the context of automatic architectural tradespace\nexploration to develop the part of computational tools that\nautomatically evaluates the architectures being generated. An\nexample of such tool was shown in the context of Earth Ob-\nserving Satellite Systems \(EOSS is\ndivided in two parts. First, the advantages and disadvantages\nof VASSAR with respect to the state-of-the-art of system\narchitecting tools is discussed. Second, the next steps in this\nresearch project are outlined.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of VASSAR\nThe following are advantages  the\nVASSAR methodology with respect to other frameworks:\n\(1  delivery\nloop. All requirements are directly traceable to stakeholder\nneeds. All capabilities are directly traceable to architectural\ndecisions.\n\(2  e.g., sci-\nence and engineering back-\ngrounds, simply because it is the way in which the human\nmind works.\n\(3  the domain-specific\nknowledge from the domain-independent knowledge, which\ntranslates into increased scalability and reusability, and facil-\nitates task allocation between system architects and software\nengineers.\n\(4  lessons learned: it serves as\na repository of knowledge to conserve expertise, and it also\nuses the lessons learned in the form of logical rules to evaluate\nsystem architectures.\n\(5  delivery loop facilitates more\n16\noptimal task allocation between man \(the system architect the computational tool architectures and through the use of the text-\nbased and graphics-based explanation facility. The system\narchitect feeds the tool with knowledge, guides the tradespace\nexploration process, and makes all non-objective decisions.\n\(6  of recursive algorithms, which\nare at the core of modeling emergence, which in turn is the\norigin of value.\n\(7  8  a computational price, which is only\nworth it if the knowledge base is likely to evolve.\n\(9  slow when the number of rules is very\nlarge.\n\(10  the expert knowledge \(e.g. lessons learned specific\npurpose: evaluating system architectures in the context of\nautomatic architectural tradespace exploration. Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSAR’s\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
