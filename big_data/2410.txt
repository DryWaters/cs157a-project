In this paper we  proposed  an improved text cluster algorithm with the improved asso ciation rules algorithm 002 It can classify the information in the database accurately according to the questions, locate the user’ question fast and therefore speeds up the inquiry rate. The experimental result indicates t hat this plan has the merits of intelligence, self-renewing, and efficient Q/A and so on 1. Introduction With the development of Internet technology, Elearning becomes increasingly popular. Facing the difficult questions appearing in study, most learners hope to obtain a satisfied answer fastly through a learning platform. There is no doubt that the intelligence Q/A system can meet request of learners. In this paper we designed an intelligence Q/A system with text data mining algorithm , which applies the improved text cluster algorithm and effectively speeds up the inquiry rate 2. Association rules algorithm and its improvement The association rules and its algorithm always count for much in data mining as a result of its huge commercial value and the theoretic value since being proposed According to the defin ition of association rules, its discovery duty may be defined as: Assigning a business database D, extract all associati on rules which satisfy the smallest support--Smin and the smallest confidence Cmin 2.1 The classical association rules mining algorithm 001j the Apriori algorithm and its flaw The Classical Apriori algorithm is an association Rules Mining algorithm with Width first Step 1: when scanning the database, calculate the support of all single projects in the database and form a single dimension frequent ite m-set with the projects whose support is bigger than the minsupp, namely L1 Then repeat scanning the database. When scanning the kth time, namely L k, the frequent item set is produced with k length. When scanning the \(k+1\e, firstly produce the candidate item set Ck+1 with k+1 length from L k, secondly use Hash tree to scan the C k+1 002 it produces a frequent item set with k+1 length 002 namely L k+1, until no production of frequent item set. The final frequent item set is 001 L k. Its merit lies in the association rules, which can effectively prune item sets and does not produce and calculate those candidat e item sets which are impossible to become frequent item-set. And thus we can obtain the smaller candidate item sets But the Apriori algorithm has some shortcomings as follows 1\The algorithm has some problem in the efficiency possibly producing the massive candidate sets. Too many scanning times are the primary cause, in that the database needs to be scanned once when seeking every k frequent item set \(k=1, 2,…, K\es. In addition, the produced candidate item sets are too many when the pattern is too long. Therefore when the database or K is too large, the running time of the algorithm would be too long or is unable to be completed. So the algorithm has not great extendibility and is difficult to be promoted 2\ produces too many false redundancy\hen the database is too large or the support or the confidence threshold value is too low, too many rules will be produced. And it is very difficult for users to discriminate and judge these rules and find truly useful information 2.2 The improved association rules algorithm the Apriori+ algorithm 2.2.1 The basic conceptions Aiming at the two major faults above, We propose an improved association rules algorithm 002 the Apriori

algorithm. According to the deci sion-making attribute in mining, the insignificant records in data source are eliminated through the reduction operation. Thus we can reduce the running time of programs, save the space, and thereby raise the mining efficiency greatly and solve the redundancy in a certain extent To describe the algorithm well, there are several conceptions as follows Definition 1 the weighting function Supposing D is a record set of historical transaction data ti is the ith record and also a vector constituting a group of attributes    t1   bm   aking attribute a i when in record t i ; tm[bm is the value of condition attribute bm when in record tm. Take weight W i as a new attribute to t i and form a new record tw i. The record set of historical data added with weight attribute is called Dw twi  ti [ai], t1 [b1], t2  tm bm  wi The correspondent weight wi of the ith record is defined as   ai The weight is defined as a kind of function of one or several decision-making attributes in the record Definition 2 the weight support The weight support of the Apriori+ algorithm is 1 1 1   n m ijj j i n i i wXt a Supp x y w 002 002 002 002 003 003 002 001\002\001\002\001\002\001\002\001\002\002 1 002 Definition 3 the confidence the confidence of th e Apriori+ algorithm is 002    Supp X Y Conf X Y Supp X 004\002 002 001\002\001\002\001\002\002 2 002 2.2.2 The description of the Apriori+ algorithm There are two main functions 1\source, clean those records whose items are less than the experiential rules requested, and obtain a subset 2\to each record according to the function of certain decisionmaking attributes. Compute the support and the confidence through weight and delete the records with low support The Algorithm flow is shown as Figure 1 Input : database: attri_supp 002 Overall mini_supp Overall mini_conf Fig.1 The Apriori+  algorithm flow chart The algorithm is d escribed as follows Output: large item set {kLk k 0011 1 andLk 001  DBset is the regular subset nRulesItemCount is the least number of items needed to meet the rules   is the weighti ng function of decision-making attribute w i  is the weighting function value Lwk is the large item set of the weighting function Cwk is the candidate set of the weighting function Wfoun-tionsup is the support of the weighting function fCWConf is the confidence of the weighting function Produce regular subset database with experiential rules --DBset D= {order by the number of items in each record Hk= {take rules from the training storehouse and obtain the least number of items-- Item-Count while \(!

The design of intelligent Q/A system On the basis of the above association rules algorithm this system firstly segments the questions of learners with data mining text cluster algorith m. The cut words will be saved together with their correspondent documents in a table. Then carry out the association rules algorithm and the weight calculating al gorithm separately, and obtain weight value of each words and association rules based on the key words in each document. Secondly write the first component the consequent of association rules in the association table, then calculate similarity of the text, and thus get the similarity of sentences. After obtaining the similarity, use it to discover th e current best answer to the question. Thus meet the request of learners and the intelligence Q/A system can be realized This function frame can be designed as Figure 2 000\003 Fig.2 The function frame of intelligence QA system 4.

The experimental results indicate that the Aprio ri+ algorithm truly has higher mining efficiency than the Apriori algorithm 4. The conclusion In this paper we adopt the improved association rules in text cluster,it can reduces the cluster time, and raises the data mining efficiency. Thus can locate the learner's question fast and speed the Q/A to a certain degree. It has the merits of intelligence, self-renewing and high Q/A efficiency and so on. As a result of scientific research condition and limited time 002 it has some fault yet 001 the accurate and fast Q/A is still the aim of the system References  Shou-ning QU.

Time Complexity and Speed We now evaluate scalability and speed with large high dimensional data sets to only compute the models as shown in Figure 7 The plotted times include the time to store models on disk but exclude the time to mine frequent itemsets We experimentally prove 1 Time complexity to compute models is linear on data set size 2 Sparse vector and matrix computations yield efÞcient algorithms whose accuracy was studied before 3 Dimensionality has minimal impact on speed assuming average transaction size T is small Transactions are clu stered with Incremental Kmeans 26 introduced on Sectio n 3 Large transaction les were created with the IBM synthetic data generator 3 ha ving defaults n 1 M T=10 I=4 Figure 7 shows time complexity to compute the clustering model The rst plot on the left shows time growth to build the clustering with a data set with one million records T10I4D1M As can be seen times grow linearly as n increases highlighting the algorithms efÞciency On the other hand notice d has marginal impact on time when it is increased 10-fold on both models due to optimized sparse matrix computations The second plot on the right in Figure 7 shows time complexity to compute clustering models increasing k on T10I4D100k Remember k is the main parameter to control support estimation accuracy In a similar manner to the previous experiments times are plotted for two high dimensionalities d  100 and d 1  000 As can be seen time complexity is linear on k  whereas time is practically independent from d  Therefore our methods are competitive both on accuracy and time performance 4.5 Summary The clustering model provides several advantages It is a descriptive model of the data set It enables support estimation and it can be processed in main memory It requires the user to specify the number of clusters as main input parameter but it does not require support thresholds More importantly clusters can help discovering long itemsets appearing at very low support levels We now discuss accuracy In general the number of clusters is the most important model characteristic to improve accuracy A higher number of clusters generally produces tighter bounds and therefore more accurate support estimations The clustering model quality has a direct relationship to support estimation error We introduced a parameter to improve accuracy wh en mining frequent itemsets from the model this parameter eliminate spurious itemsets unlikely to be frequent The clustering model is reasonably accurate on a wide spectrum of support values but accuracy decreases as support decreases We conclude with a summary on time complexity and efÞciency When the clustering model is available it is a signiÞcantly faster mechanis m than the A-priori algorithm to search for frequent itemsets Decreasing support impacts performance due to the rapid co mbinatorial growth on the number of itemsets In general the clustering model is much smaller than a large data set O  dk  O  dn  A clustering model can be computed in linear time with respect to data set size In typical transaction data sets dimensionality has marginal impact on time 5 Related Work There is a lot of research work on scalable clustering 1 30 28 a nd ef  c i e nt as s o ci at i o n m i n i n g 24  1 6  40  but little has been done nding relations hips between association rules and other data mining techniques SufÞcient statistics are essential to accelerate clustering 7 30 28  Clustering binary data is related to clustering categorical data and binary streams 26 The k modes algorithm is proposed in 19  t hi s a l gori t h m i s a v a ri ant o f K means  but using only frequency counting on 1/1 matches ROCK is an algorithm that groups points according to their common neighbors links in a

Also ROCK is a hierarchical algorithm One interesting aspect discussed in 14 i s t he error p ropagat i o n w hen u s i ng a distance-based algorithm to cluster binary data in a hierarchical manner Nevertheless K-means is not hierarchical Using improved computations for text clustering given the sparse nature of matrices has been used before 6 There is criticism on using distance similarity metrics for binary data 12  b ut i n our cas e w e h a v e p ro v e n K means can provide reasonable results by ltering out most itemsets which are probably infrequent Research on association rules is extensive 15 Mos t approaches concentrate on speed ing up the association generation phase 16 S ome o f t hem u s e dat a s t ruct ures t h at can help frequency counting for itemsets like the

for data streams with the support of recent and old itemsets this approach relies on discrete algorithms for efÞcient frequency computation instead of using machine learning models like our proposal

constrained frequent itemset search are NP-hard and they are at least P-hard meaning t hey will remain intractable even if P=NP This work gives evidence it is not a good idea to mine all frequent itemsets above a support threshold since the output size is combinatorial In 13 t h e a ut hors d eri v e a bound on the number of candidate itemsets given the current set of frequent itemsets when using a level-wise algorithm Covers and bases 37 21 a re an alternati v e t o s ummarize association rules using a comb inatorial approach instead of a model Clusters have some resemblance to bases in the sense that each cluster can be used to derive all subsets from a maximal itemset The model represents an approximate cover for all potential associations We now discuss closely related work on establishing relationships between association rules and other data mining techniques Preliminary results on using clusters to get lower and upper bounds for support is given in 27  I n g eneral there is a tradeoff between rules with high support and rules with high conÞdence 33 t h i s w o rk propos es an al gorithm that mines the best rules under a Bayesian model There has been work on clustering transactions from itemsets 41  H o w e v er  t hi s a pproach goes i n t he oppos i t e di rection it rst mines associations and from them tries to get clusters Clustering association rules rather than transactions once they are mined is analyzed in 22  T he out put is a summary of association rules The approach is different from ours since this proposal works with the original data set whereas ours produces a model of the data set In 42 the idea of mining frequent itemsets with error tolerance is introduced This approach is related to ours since the error is somewhat similar to the bounds we propose Their algorithm can be used as a means to cluster transactions or perform estimation of query selectivity In 39 t he aut hors explore the idea of building approximate models for associations to see how they change over time 6 Conclusions This article proposed to use clusters on binary data sets to bound and estimate association rule support and conÞdence The sufÞcient statistics for clustering binary data are simpler than those required for numeric data sets and consist only of the sum of binary points transactions Each cluster represents a long itemset from which shorter itemsets can be easily derived The clustering model on high dimensional binary data sets is computed with efÞcient operations on sparse matrices skipping zeroes We rst presented lower and upper bounds on support whose average estimates actual support Model-based support metrics obey the well-known downward closure property Experiments measured accuracy focusing on relative error in support estimations and efÞciency with real and synthetic data sets A clustering model is accurate to estimate support when using a sufÞciently high number of clusters When the number of clusters increases accuracy increases On the other hand as the minimum support threshold decreases accuracy also decreases but at a different rate depending on the data set The error on support estimation slowly increases as itemset length increases The model is fairly accurate to discover a large set of frequent itemsets at multiple support levels Clustering is faster than A-priori to mine frequent itemsets without considering the time to compute the model Adding the time to compute the model clustering is slower than Apriori at high support levels but faster at low support levels The clustering model can be built in linear time on data size Sparse matrix operations enable fast computation with high dimensional transaction data sets There exist important research issues We want to analytically understand the relationship between the clustering model and the error on support estimation We need to determine an optimal number of clusters given a maximum error level Correlation analysis and PCA represent a next step after the clustering model but the challenges are updating much larger matrices and dealing with numerical issues We plan to incorporate constraints based on
