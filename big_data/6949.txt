In this paper we present an improved method for predicting missing attribute values in data sets We make use of frequent itemsets generated from the association rules algorithm displaying the correlations between different items in a set of transactions In particular we consider a database as a set of transactions and each data instance as an itemset Then frequent itemsets can be used as a knowledge base to predict missing attribute values Our approach integrates the RSFit method based on rough sets theory that produces faster predictions by considering similarities of attribute value pairs but only for those attributes contained in the core or reduct of the data set Using empirical studies on UCI and other real world data sets we demonstrate a signi\336cant increase in prediction accuracy obtained from our new integrated approach referred to as ItemRSFit 
Abstract 
How to process data containing missing attribute values is an important task in the data preprocessing stage for data mining applications Missing attribute values commonly exist in real-world data sets They may come from the collecting process or from redundant diagnosis tests change of the experimental design privacy concerns unknown data etc Various approaches on how to cope with the missing attribute values have been proposed in the past years For example in 5 p ropos ed met hods i n cl ude 223us ing the most common attribute value\224 223ignoring examples with unknown attribute values\224 and 223assigning all possible values of the attribute restricted to the given concept\224 In 4 v ect ors o f a l l at t ri b ut es are c ompared a nd a d i s tance function is used to determine the most similar attribute pairs in order to assign the missing value These approaches have dif\036culties however For example selecting the most frequent value may lead to an inconsistent data set assigning 223unknown\224 to an attribute may not be reasonable in some instances e.g for gender in a health data set We are interested in predicting missing attribute values in the data preprocessing stage of the knowledge discovery process Motivated to develop a technique that can predict all the missing attribute values with high precision we integrate two techniques into our solution The 036rst is the association rule algorithm 1 w hi ch i s well known in data mining for discovering item relationships from large transaction d ata sets Prior to the association rule generation frequent itemsets are generated based on the item-item relations from the large data set according to a certain 
Addressing Missing Attributes During Data Mining Using Frequent Itemsets And Rough Set Based Predictions 1 Introduction 
 Thus the frequent itemsets of a data set represent strong correlations between different items and the itemsets represent probabilities for one or more items existing together in the current transaction In our research we are considering a certain data set as a set of transactions The implications from frequent itemsets can be used to 036nd which attribute value the missing attribute is strongly connected to and frequent itemsets can be used for predicting the missing values We call this approach the 223itemset-approach\224 for prediction Apparently the greater the number of frequent itemsets used for the prediction the more information from the data set itself is used for prediction hence the higher the accu racy that will be obtained However generating frequent itemsets for a large data set is time-consuming Lower support requirements lead to a larger number of frequent itemsets but usually cost a signi\036cant amount of computation time Although demanding higher support requires less computation time the resulting itemsets show restricted item relationships and the applicable number of itemsets are fewer therefore not all the missing values can be predicted In order to balance the tradeoff between computatio n time and the percentage of the applicable prediction another approach must be taken into consideration The second element of our solution is rough sets theory proposed in the 1980\222s by Pawlak 9 and u s e d for at tribute selection rule discovery and many knowledge discovery applications in the areas such as data mining machine learning and medical diagnoses Core and reduct are

 Therefore the attributes contained in the reduct or core are more important and representative than the rest of the attributes By examining only attributes within the same core or reduct to 036nd the similar attribute value pairs for the data instance containing the missing attribute values we can assign the most relevant value for the missing attribute Since this method only considers a subset of the data set which is either the core or the reduct the prediction is faster than those considering the complete data set This approach 223RSFit\224 Rough Set Fit 7 i s a n a lter n ati v e a p p r o ach f o r f ast p r e d i ctio n a n d it can be used to predict missing attributes that cannot be predicted by the frequent itemsets We integrate the prediction based on frequent itemsets and the RSFit approach into a new approach  ROSETTA software i s us ed for reduct generation Secondly a new decision table  A distance function such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance is then applied to compute the similarities between different attribute-value pairs The best match has the smallest difference from the target attribute-value pair When this is determined we assign the value from the best matched attributevalue pair to the target missing value Thus a complete data set without missing values is obtained We demonstrate the RSFit approach by an arti\036cial car data set which appeared in a s s ho w n i n T a bl e 1  O ne missing attribute value for 223compress\224 is randomly selected across the data set as shown by Table 2 a First the core

In the experiments on the UCI data sets 3 w e s t udy ho w the ItemRSFit approach can be applied for predictions on different types of data sets We experiment on data sets with no missing attribute values For data sets with continuous attributes we discretize the attribute values to discrete data before generating frequent itemsets For each data set we randomly select a certain percentage of the total possible missing values total number of condition attributes 
 This can be explained as follows 223Support\224 is a measure to evaluate the occurrence of both the antecedents and the consequents of an association rule in the data set The higher the support is the more frequent this occurrence has to be and the less knowledge for prediction is obtained When the support value is increased fewer matched cases are found from the itemset approach therefore more missing values have to be predicted by the RSFit approach The lowest accuracy of the ItemRSFit approach is equal to the accuracy from the RSFit approach The RSFit approach gives the baseline prediction accuracy for the ItemRSFit approach For different numbers of missing attribute values the frequent itemsets with the lowest support brings the highest prediction accuracy The frequent itemsets alone as the knowledge base to predict the missing values cannot fully 036nd all the matches for the missing value for geriatric care data where the itemset cannot be applied which guarantee that more important attributes are taken into considerations while predicting attributes The proposed ItemRSFit approach provides predictions based on the data domain itself which better preserves the originality of the data sets and avoids noise Third in 10 dat a as s o ci at i ons  w hi ch are similar to associated rule s are generated according to

both support and con\036dence and used as a knowledge base for predictions Our approach is more ef\036cient because we do not need to generate associated rules based on both support and con\036dence for prediction Only support is used for frequent itemsets generation in the ItemRSFit approach 
We explore a new usage of association rule algorithms to predict missing attribute values combined with rough sets theory We 036rst introduce a new approach RSFit to assign missing attribute values based on rough sets theory Comparing to the 223closest 036t\224 approach 4 this approach signi\036cantly reduces the computation time and a comparable accuracy is achieved We then introduce an integrated approach ItemRSFit based on both the association rule algorithm and rough sets theory to assign missing attribute values The experimental results show the new approach obtains high prediction accuracy It relies on its own data as a knowledge base and therefore the predicted values are not biased In our research we adopt the strategies used by 11 o n balancing the computational cost and the prediction accuracy Lower support value can bring a higher prediction accuracy however frequent itemsets with lower support requires more time for computation than frequent itemsets with higher support In the future we are interested in exploring a satisfactory balance between the support value and the prediction accuracy Given the available computational cost and the affordable computation time it is interesting to explore what percentage of the missing attributes can be effectively predicted and what are the most effective attributes to be predicted In case of a higher prediction cost the idea of giving more important attributes higher priorities for predictions can be applied as an heuristic

Figure 3 Memory Usage of Bodon and Chester implementations on webdocs as Measured by Unix top command during late stages of execution mine sufÞciently low support thresholds on even a modestsized benchmark datasetÑnever mind the gigabytes of data in many real-world applications By introducing a vertical sort at the onset of the classic APriori algorithm signiÞcant improvements can be made Besides simply having better localised data storage the candidate generation can be done more efÞciently and an indexing structure can be built on the candidates at the same time Candidates can be compressed to improve comparison times as well as data structure size The cumulative effect of these improvements is observable in the implementation that we created Whereas other algorithms have been heavily optimised this work opens up many avenues for yet more pronounced improvement Given their independence the data structures used can be partitioned and parallelised quite easily with minimal need for inter-process communication Because our algorithmÕs memory footprint is so small we have sufÞcient memory available to fully exploit multi-core architectures without disk thrashing We expect future results to show a near-linear improvement with an increase in the number of cores Extending the index to more than one item to improve its precision should also yield signiÞcant improvement The result of this research is that the frequent itemset mining problem can now be extended to much lower support thresholds or equivalently larger effective le sizes than have even yet been considered These improvements came at no performance cost as evidenced by the fact that our implementation matched the state-of-the-art competitors while consuming much less memory Prior to this work it has been assumed that the performance of APriori is prohibitively slow This reestablishes it as the frontier algorithm R EFERENCES 1 R A g r a w a l T I m i e l i n s k i  a n dA N S w a m i   M i n i n g a s sociation rules between sets of items in large databases in Proc of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data Washington D.C May 26-28 1993  ACM Press 1993 pp 207Ð216 2 P  W  P ur dom D  V  G ucht  a nd D  P  G r ot h  A v e r a gecase performance of the apriori algorithm SIAM Journal on Computing  vol 33 no 5 pp 1223Ð1260 2004 3 R  A gr a w al and R  S r i kant   Fast al gor i t hms f or mi ni ng association rules in Proc of VLDB  1994 pp 487Ð499 4 J  H an J  P ei  a nd Y  Y i n Mi n i n g f r e quent pat t er ns w i t h out candidate generation in SIGMOD Conference  ACM 2000 pp 1Ð12 5 S  B r i n R  Mot w ani  J D  U l l m an a nd S  T s ur   D ynami c itemset counting and implication rules for market basket data SIGMOD Rec  vol 26 no 2 pp 255Ð264 1997 6 C  L ucchese S  O r l a ndo R  P e r e go and F  S i l v est r i  W ebdocs a real-life huge transactional dataset in FIMI ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 126 2004 7 G  B uehr er  S  P ar t h asar at hy  a nd A  G hot i ng O ut o f c or e frequent pattern mining on a commodity pc in KDD 06 Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining NewYork NY USA ACM 2006 pp 86Ð95 8 B  G oet h al s E f  ci ent f r e quent pat t e r n mi ni ng  P h D  di ssertation transnationale Universiteit Limburg 2002 9 N  D e x t e r s  P  W  P ur dom a nd D  V a n G ucht   A p r obabi l i t y analysis for candidate-based frequent itemset algorithms in SAC 06  New York NY USA ACM 2006 pp 541Ð545  R  S r i k ant a nd R  A g r a w a l  Mi n i n g s equent i a l p at t e r n s Generalizations and performance improvements in Proc 5th Int Conf Extending Database Technology EDBT96  1996 pp 3Ð17  C  B o r g el t a nd R  K r use I nduct i o n o f a ssoci at i o n r ul es Apriori implementation in Proceedings of the fteenth conference on computational statistics  2002 pp 395Ð400  F  B odon  A f a st apr i or i i mpl e ment at i on  i n Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations FIMIÕ03  ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 90 Melbourne Florida USA 19 November 2003  C  B o r g el t  R ecur s i o n p r uni ng f o r t he apr i or i a l gor i t hm  i n FIMI  ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 126 2004  C  L u cchese S  O r l a ndo and R  P er e go kdci  on usi n g d i r ect count up to the third iteration in FIMI  ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 126 2004  FIMI 04 Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Brighton UK November 1 2004  ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 126 2004  G  G r ahne and J  Z hu E f  ci ent l y u si ng pr e xt r ees i n mining frequent itemsets in FIMI  ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 126 2003 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 


For the spatial partitioning we use the Military Grid Reference System MGRS Thus w ay  we represent an y location on the surface of the Earth at multiple granularities ranging from 1 002 1 m 2 to 100 002 100 km 2  by an alphanumeric value For temporal partitioning we use the typical temporal hierarchies from data warehousing hour day week month We drop cells with very low activity speci\002cally cells where the most popular term occurs in fewer than 5 messages at the 002nest granularity hour We will shortly describe how we 002x the spatio-temporal hierarchy in AFIA based on the considered workload We perform three sets of experiments The 002rst measures the space and accuracy of the proposed algorithms and compares them with two baselines The second evaluates the throughput memory consumption and number of checkpoints when varying the targeted k parameter The third evaluates the query processing performance when varying the size of the spatio-temporal query range We also show the number of checkpoints created during a time period B Data and Queries We collected all geo-tagged messages from the public Twitter FireHose during May 2013 The dataset contains 110,426,053 tweets yielding an average rate of circa 41 tweet per second Figure 9 provides insight into the workload and helps choose an appropriate spatio-temporal hierarchy Figure 9a shows the total number of cells that receive at least one tweet Thus the graph shows the expected number of active summaries at the given granularities For example every hour the number of 0.1 002 0.1 km 2  1 002 1 km 2  10 002 10 km 2  and 100 002 100 km 2 spatial grid cells that receive at least one tweet is circa 0.5M 200K 40K and 10K respectively i.e the 223Hour\224 curve in the 002gure Figure 9b considers the cells at the 0.1 km 002 0.1 km 002 1 hour granularity The y-axis depicts the number of such cells subject to different loads the number of terms t processed This shows that the number of 223interesting\224 cells with at least 100 terms is quite low barely reaching 100 Therefore we 002x the 002nest temporal granularity at an hour Figure 9c considers the cells at the 100 km 002 100 km 002 1 week granularity The 002gure shows that thousands of such cells have summaries that receive more than 1 thousand terms We 002x k at 25 and generate 2 query sets each consisting of 100 queries Each query in the 002rst set has a temporal extent with a length chosen at random among 1 hour 1 day and 1 week and it has a randomly selected spatial region The spatial granularity of the coarsest cell that is contained in the spatial query region is the query's spatial granularity and the query region is enlarged to cover all the cells at that granularity that it intersects with In visual terms this procedure corresponds to 223snapping\224 the spatial query region to the coarser granularity The underlying rationale for adopting this procedure is that 002ner-granularity cells do not contribute with term counts at the same magnitude as do cells at the granularity of the coarsest fully covered cell Since any rectangle can be created from a number of merged squares we limit the experiments to squares Each cell contains 10 002 10 cells at the next 002ner granularity Thus the largest number of cells any query square can cover is 18 002 18  324 As a result we employ queries that may cover up to 1,800 002 1,800 km 2  While the 002rst query set focuses on variation in the spatial range the second focuses on temporal variation Each of the 100 queries has a spatial region chosen at random from one of the spatial granularities The query resulting in most temporal summary merges is the query that spans from the 002rst hour after midnight on the 002rst day in May until the hour before midnight on the last day of May This query covers 2 002 23 hours 3  5 days and 3 weeks which amounts to 57 temporal summaries To avoid empty results we do not consider regions that only cover empty cells Note that we do not perform compaction on the last active temporal granularities to better re\003ect the real-life scenario where a stream is constantly keeping these summaries active To simplify the experiments the initCounters parameter which determines the initial number of counters is set to the same value as targeted k  C Baselines We consider two baselines for comparison and validation of our proposal SS In each active spatio-temporal summary we aggregate the most frequent items using the SpaceSaving algorithm Active summaries maintain a 002xed number  m  of items and their counts while archived summaries are compacted by keeping only the counters for the k most frequent terms Choosing a value for m represents a trade-off between storage size and result accuracy HT In each active spatio-temporal summary we maintain a full list of terms using a hash table Once the summary becomes inactive and is archived its time granularity passes the list is sorted and cleaned up by discarding all but the counters for the targeted topk terms This approach maintains the exact topk items at all spatio-temporal granularities and serves to measure the accuracy of the other approaches However since HT has excessive storage requirements we do not expect it to scale under the considered workloads D The Space Versus Accuracy Trade-Off In the 002rst set of experiments we evaluate the accuracy of our approach by comparing it with the baselines Since HT maintains the exact counts at all granularities its storage requirements are too high for large scale experiments Similarly SS maintains a 002xed number m of counters at all granularities and m cannot be set too high for large scale experiments Thus we consider only tweets occurring in the spatial region with the 11S grid zone designator a region in the US of size ca 900 002 550 km 2  We use the local machine We consider variants of SS where m is set to 50 100 and 200 In AFIA we set targeted k to 50 The 002rst week four days in May is used for warm-up and only the accuracies of the subsequent summaries are evaluated We perform topk queries on all summaries at each spatio-temporal granularity We compare the topk most frequent terms in each summary produced by AFIA and SS and compare with the corresponding topk items produced by HT We set k  20  156

Fig 14 Checkpoints Over Time V C ONCLUSIONS We present a new framework for the processing of spatiotemporally constrained topk most popular terms queries on streaming spatio-temporally tagged text content such as microblog posts The framework's index extends existing techniques for counting frequent items in summaries to allow the summaries to grow and shrink dynamically to adapt to changes in the incoming data Query processing works by merging relevant summaries To provide guarantees about the query results a new merging algorithm is proposed that supports spatio-temporal query regions Experimental studies with an implementation of the framework offers insight into the accuracy scalability and performance of the processing of incoming data and queries and they demonstrate that the framework is capable of offering very accurate query results at high performance at scale A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported in part by the MADALGO research center and in part by the

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
