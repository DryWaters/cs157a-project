While the y do i mpro v e throughput the y adv ersely impact TCP friendliness and R TT f airness 9 In contrast Cascaded TCP reduces the latenc y that a connection e xperiences by se gmenting the path On the other hand algorithms such as XCP 10 and ECN pro vide the sender with control information to a v oid losses due to congestion Subsequently lo w aggre g ate throughput can be a v oided by

the sender s connection closes the relay starts forw arding traf c to the destination or the ne xt relay in the chain It is understandable that such an approach w ould not be a viable option

the bandwidth utilization is at times greater than 100 which is not possible in reality  W e attrib ute this to the coarse-grained emulation by Dummynet This beha vior is most apparent for lo w-latenc y conﬁgurations W e compute the transfer size based on the bandwidth-delay product such that the TCP connection remains in streaming state for about 90 of the time for small bandwidth-delay products the transfer sizes are small and tests complete in a fe w seconds V ariations in emulation at such granularities ha v e signiﬁcant impact on the results In contrast we do not see the same beha vior for tests with lar ge bandwidth-delay products as the errors are amortized o v er the duration of the test W e could ha v e increased transfer sizes to amortize the ef fect of these errors While doing so for short l atencies amortized the errors for lar ge latencies the test durations became unreasonably long An al ternate approach w ould be to use dif ferent transfer size proportions for short and long latencies in this case ho we v er  we w ould not be doing a f air comparison across conﬁgurations W e note that if loss and latenc y conﬁgurations remain the same and link capacities increase the throughput achie v ed has a slight b ut noticeable decrease This observ ation may be e xplained as follo ws Assume a link with gi v en bandwidth capacity and uniform loss Here the windo w size will be able to gro w to a certain percentage of the maximum size before loss is e xperienced and subsequently the windo w size drops If the loss beha vior remains the same the percentage of maximum windo w size achie v ed is less for a high capacity link This is observ ed in the empirical results 2 Thr oughput impr o ves by intr oducing layer 4 r elay\(s Figure 2\(a sho ws that introducing a single relay results in signiﬁcant impro v ement in bandwidth utilization due to better a v erage throughput By introducing a relay halfw ay  we split the connection into tw o TCP connections Each split connection has shorter latenc y and therefore results in better aggre g ate throughput and thus better bandwidth utilization Figure 2\(b pro vides a summary of the relati v e dif ference in bandwidth utilization Cascaded TCP with a single relay deli v ers up to tw ofold impro v ement in bandwidth utilization Figure 2\(a sho ws that as latenc y increases Cascaded TCP achie v es increasing bandwidth utilization The relati v e dif fer ence continues to gro w and goes be yond 100 in some cases as seen in Figure 2\(b F or e xample with latencies of 256 ms at 8 Mbps Cascaded TCP continues to be twice as ef cient as compared to long-haul TCP  The same is observ ed for bandwidths as high as 32 Mbps and latencies 64 ms which is in f act the same bandwidth-delay product as the former e xample W e see similar trends with v arying losses too W e observ e smooth trends in our results e xcept for select cases in Figure 2\(b of 32 Mbps capacity and 128 ms latenc y  This apparent anomaly is due to the observ ed v alue being just o v er the lo wer bin limit and hence an artif act of binning W e note that throughput drops at high bandwidth-delay products and we see diminishing returns with one relay  W e anticipate that if more relays are added while assuming that latenc y is equally split between them we w ould continue to utilizations 3 Multiple r elays continue to impr o ve thr oughput 3 sho ws that using tw o relays results in further impro v ement in throughput and therefore ut ilization W ith tw o relays Cascaded TCP achie v es approximately 90 utilization when the end-to-end latenc y is 64 ms and loss is 0.1 This is reasonably near the theoretical limit of about 94 when compared to a connection with maximum utilization  the limit of 94 is e xperienced due to protocol o v erheads W e see the same trends for all cases of losses Here ag ain we see that median bandwidth utilizations for Cascaded TCP are al w ays signiﬁcantly better than that of long-haul TCP  4 Cascaded TCP performs well with high losses ith Cascaded TCP  we achie v e better throughput e v en when losses are high because the latenc y for the split TCP connections is shorter  allo wing the congestion-control algorithm to react more quickly  This deli v ers better throughput and therefore better bandwidth utilization W ith zero losses Cascaded TCP enables throughput up to twice as much as long-haul TCP connections this is observ ed e v en when latencies are as high as 256 ms Here we do not sho w bandwidth utilization results for v arying losses due to lack of space Note that for lo w loss the impro

semantics are also brok en by middlebox es such as re w alls and N A Ts The concerns we f ace in maintaining end-to-end semantics with Cascaded TCP relays ar e no more than what we already e xperience with middlebox es As long as the risks of using such relays/middlebox es are understood the beneﬁts of increased throughput outweighs the concerns Ne v ertheless this may not apply to all situations E Does Cascaded TCP maintain TCP friendliness The e xpectations from congestion control algorithms are that the y maintain high bandwidth utilization R TT f airness and end-to-end semantics The y are also e xpected to be TCP friendly  As Cascaded TCP continues to use TCP Ne w Reno it maintains both TCP friendliness and R TT f airness while throughput BIC CUBIC and Compound TCP do maintain end-to-end semantics and impro v e upon bandwidth utilization when compared with TCP Ne w Reno ho we v er  the y do not maintain TCP friendliness and R TT f airness for lar ge latencies 9 F  Should the use of Cascaded TCP be hidden fr om the user deployed Whether the use of Cascaded TCP relays is apparent to applications or not depends on ho w the transport layer implements the solution What is important to note is that there is a need to mak e a decision based on conte xt in which communication occurs  for e xample based on latenc y  loss link capacity e xperi enced by the connection and a v ailability of relays This decision process may be transparent and automated by a daemon implementing the analytical model as described in Section III subsequently aiding the netw ork stack or it may be controlled by the end user as w as suggested al by implementing policies As e xplained in Section IV we used an e xpedient method to establish a proof of concept Ideally  to support the transport layer a frame w ork w ould be required to identify potential relays setup transport connections between the relays and communication F URE W ORK W e plan to in v estig ate ho w cascaded TCP  which we v e seen to be a viable step to w ards impro ving throughput performs in connection with other congestion control algorithms such as  7  to study the beneﬁts of using them t ogether and as an alternate solution W e also intend to study the beneﬁts of Cascaded TCP for parallel streams If the sender does not generate traf c at a suitable rate the relays may e xperience b uf fer drought W e try to accommodate for this aspect in our model in 6 by considering the number of windo ws that the relay w aits for before it may start relaying Alternati v ely  if the sender generates traf c at a higher rate than what the relay could accommodate we f ace a b uf fer o v erﬂo w probl em W e are in the process of formulating an optimization problem that allo ws us to choose the location of relays and b uf fer sizes when considering the latenc y and loss constraints while maximizing throughput VIII S Y In this paper  we ha v e sho wn that we can impro v e bandwidth utilization by reducing the impact of end-to-end latenc y on typical congestion-control protocols W e do so by introducing layer 4 forw arding relays which allo ws us to split a TCP connection into tw o or more TCP connections that are cascaded together to form one logical end-to-end connection As each se gment s congestion-control algorithm operates independently and reacts to feedback from the recei v er much f aster than that of the long-haul TCP connection Cascaded TCP enables greater o v erall throughput and thus better bandwidth utilization W e present an analytical model that allo ws us to mak e an informed decision as to when the use of Cascaded TCP w ould be viable W e present and e v aluate the results of the analytical model and our empirical tests W e conclude that introducing relays results in a signiﬁcant increase in throughput for man y practical scenarios A CK NO WLE DGE M E NT S This research w as funded in part by V ir ginia T ech and Juniper Netw orks R CES 1 yd al  The Ne wReno
