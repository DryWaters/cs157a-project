Assume that there are n learners    2 1  S S n S  there are m questions    2 1  Q Q m Q and there are p  concepts    2 1  C C p C then we can transform the test portfolio of the learners and the conceptual weight relationships to the matrix G and the matrix QC respectively Let Q x  denote the x th question, where 1   x    m and let S z  denote the z th student, where 1   z    n Then, we can get the grade matrix G shown as follows     2 1 2 1 2 22 21 1 12 11 2 1 n mn m m n n m S S S g g g g g g g g g Q Q Q G                          where g xz  0 g xz 1 denotes the student S z gets the right answer in question Q x and g xz  0 denotes the student S z has a wrong answer in question Q x   where 1   x    m and 1   z    n  In the same way, we can construct the questions-concept matrix QC shown as follows  2 1 2 1 2 22 21 1 12 11 2 1 p mp m m p p m C C C qc qc qc qc qc qc qc qc qc Q Q Q QC                          2489 2010 IEEE 978-1-4244-6527-9/10/$26.00 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010 


  where qc st denotes the degree of relevance of question Q s with respect to concept C t and 0   qc st   1. The proposed method to construct concept maps in adaptive learning systems is now presented as follows Setp 1  Base on the grade matrix G calculate the counter value    y x Q Q Count between the questions Q x  and Q y by the matrix G where Q x  g x 1  g x 2  g xn  Q y  g y 1  g y 2  g yn  and     y x Q Q Count     1   n k yk xk g g 1 where the counter value    y x Q Q Count indicates the answer-consistence between the questions Q x and Q y   denotes the XNOR operator. If    y x Q Q Count    n  40 then consider four kinds of association rules based on Q x and Q y  as shown in Step 2 Otherwise, we ignore it, where n  denotes the number of students. For example, if Q x 0  0   and Q y 0  0  0  0 t h en  Count  Q x  Q y  Count 0  0  0  0  0 0  0  1   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1  1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 4  Setp 2  Based on the counter values    y x Q Q Count obtained in Step 1, consider four kinds of asso ciation rules, shown as follows 1  If the learner gets the right answer in question Q x  then he/she also gets th e right answer in question Q y  2  If the learner gets the right answer in question Q y  then he/she also gets th e right answer in question Q x  3  If the learner has the wrong answer in question Q x  then he/she also has the wrong answer in question Q y  4  If the learner has the wrong answer in question Q y  then he/she also has the wrong answer in question Q x  Calculate the confidence cf xy of the association rule Q x  Q y  based on four kinds of assoc iation rules, shown as follows cf xy        x y x Q Sup Q Q Sup             2 where cf xy denotes the confidence of the association rule  Q x  Q y  Sup  Q x  Q y  of the 2-itemset  Q x  Q y nd Sup  Q x denotes the support of the 1-itemset Q x Assume that the minimum confidence in this example is 0.75, then if the confidence of an association rule is smaller than 0.75, we delete this association rule. For example, Table 1 shows the co nfidences of the association rules Q x  Q y  and Q y  Q x respectively, where they denotes that çif the question Q x is correctly learned by the learner, then the question Q y is also correctly learned by the learneré and çif the question Q y is correctly learned by th e learner, then the question Q x is also correctly learned by the learner respectively. \(i.e., Correct to Correct T ABLE 1  A SSOCIATION RULES C ORRECT TO C ORRECT  Association Rules Confidence Preserve or Delete Q x   Q y 0.5 Delete Q y   Q x  1 Preserve  Table 2 shows the confidences of the association rule  Q x  Q y and Q y  Q x respectively, where they denotes that çif the question Q x is incorrectly learned by the learner then the question Q y is also incorrectly learned by the learner and çif the question Q y is incorrectly learned by the learner then the question Q x is also incorrectly learned by the learner respectively. \(i.e., Incorrect to Incorrect T ABLE 2  A SSOCIATION RULES I NCORRECT TO I NCORRECT  Association Rules Confidence Preserve or Delete Q x   Q y  1 Preserve Q y   Q x 0.75 Preserve  Setp 3 Create a new question-concept QC from the question-concept matrix QC base on two cases, shown as follows Case 1 If there are more than one nonzero values in a concept C t s  column for all questions Q s from matrix QC  where 1   s    m  m is the number of questions, then we calculate the qc  st shown as follows    m u ut st st qc qc qc 1  3 Case 2 Otherwise, we let  qc  st  qc st 4 where qc  st denotes the degree of relevance of question Q s with respect to concept C t of matrix QC 1   s    m 1   t    p  m is the number of questions p is the number of concepts  and 0   qc  st   1 qc st denotes the degree of relevance of question Q s with respect to concept C t of matrix QC 1   s    m 1   t    p  m is the number of questions p is the number of concepts and 0   qc st   1 and   m u ut qc 1 denotes the total degree of relevance of concept C t in all questions. Assume that the association rule Q x  Q y is based on çincorrectly learned to incorrectly learnedé and it s concept relationship is C i  C j where C i denotes a concept appearing in the question Q x  C j denotes a concept appearing in the question Q y 1   i    p 1   j    p and i   j Because P  Q and Q  P are 2490 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010 


  logically equivalent, if the association rule Q x  Q y is based on çcorrectly learned to correctly learned then itês concept relationship should be C j  C i Then, we calculate the relevance degree   y x Q Q j i C C   rev between concepts C i and C j from the relationship Q x  Q y shown as follows   y x Q Q j i C C   rev   qc xi   qc  yj    cf xy  5 where   y x Q Q j i C C   rev denotes the relevance degree of the relationship C i  C j from the relationship Q x  Q y      1  0 rev    y x Q Q j i C C  C i denotes a concept in question Q x  C j denotes a concept in question Q y  qc xi  denotes the degree of relevance of question Q x with respect to concept C i of matrix QC and 0   qc xi   1 and qc  yj denotes the degree of relevance of question Q y with respect to concept C j of matrix QC and 0   qc yj   1 and cf xy denotes the confidence of the association rule Q x  Q y  Step 4 Let   Min  qc st 6 where  denotes the threshold value of the relevance degree   0,1 qc st denotes the degree of relevance of question Q s with respect to concept C t of matrix QC 1   s    m 1   t    p  m is the number of questions p is the number of concepts  and 0   qc st   1. If   y x Q Q j i C C   rev is smaller than  then we calculate      N i  N j 7 where  denotes the summation of N i and N j  N i denotes the number of the questions which have concept C i  N j denotes the number of the questions which have concept C j If     m   50%, then we preserve the relevance degree   y x Q Q j i C C   rev even though it is smaller than threshold value  where m is the number of total questions  Because question Q x and question Q y are the unusual questions which contain the concept C i and concept C j respectively, we consider the relationship C i  C j is more important between Q x and Q y  Step 5 Construct the concepts-relationship between any two concepts C i and C j If   y x Q Q j i C C   rev  is larger than  or     m   50%, then we set the relationship form the concept C i  to the concept C j with the relevance degree, where the concepts-relationship from C i  to C j  means that the concept C i should be the pre-required concept of the concept C j   Step 6 If there are more than one concepts- relationship between concepts C i and C j then we only keep the concept-relationship with the maximum relevance degree and delete the others 3  An example Assume that the grade matrix G and the questions-concept matrix QC are shown as follows   0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 S S S S S Q Q Q Q Q G                    1 0 0 0 0 0 3  0 0 4  0 3  0 0 0 5  0 0 5  0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 C C C C C Q Q Q Q Q QC                    Step  Based on the grade matrix G we can calculate the counter values    y x Q Q Count between any two questions Q x  and  Q y where 1   x   5, 1   y   5 and x    y shown as follows Count  Q 1  Q 2  Count 0  0  0  1  1    0 0 0 0 1    0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1  1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 4  Count  Q 1  Q 3  Count 0  0  0 0  0 0 0 0  3 Count  Q 1  Q 4  Count 0  0  0 1  1 0 0 0  1 Count  Q 1  Q 5  Count 0  0  0 1  1 1 0 0  0 Count  Q 2  Q 3  Count 0  0  0 0  0 0 0 0  4 Count  Q 2  Q 4  Count 0  0  0 1  1 0 0 0  2 Count  Q 2  Q 5  Count 0  0  0 1  1 1 0 0   1  Count  Q 3  Q 4  Count 0  0  0 1  1 0 0 0  3 Count  Q 3  Q 5  Count 0  0  0 1  1 1 0 0  2 Count  Q 4  Q 5  Count 1  1  0 1  1 1 0 0   4  We keep the counter values which are not smaller than 40 of n where n is the number of students. Because the number of students is 5 \(i.e n 5\we can see that 5 ◊ 40% = 2 Step  Based on the counter values obtained in Step 1, we consider four kinds of association rules.
