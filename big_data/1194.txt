neration.  However, CloSET must scan database two time s. In order to enhance the efficiency of CloSET+ algorithms and reduce the I/O cost of database scanning in frequent closed itemsets mining, propose a novel algorithm called QCloSET+ which can mining Frequent closed itemsets with one database scanning Keywords Data mining; Association rules; FP-tree; Frequent itemsets 1. Introduction The increase of data stored in many organizations has speeded up with the advent of Internet. Although the database technology is keeping on improving and 
competent of manipulating huge amount of data, what is important is the useful information or implicit knowledge embedded in data. To extract the embedded implicit knowledge from data, many data mining methods have been proposed  At first, most of the data mining methods focused on mining association rules in transaction databases. A transaction contains a set of data items where there is not a special order between them, and association rules may exist between the items. Thus the methods to tackle this kind of 
problems are regarded to find transactional association rules. However, the data in so me applications are sequential in nature, such as web logs and stock trends. Then it is more valuable to mine sequential patterns in this kind of data Mining frequent itemsets requires to discover all the itemsets in a given dataset D which have a support higher or equal\ than a given minimum frequency threshold min supp[1,2  T h i s  pr obl em h a s bee n ext e ns i v el y st udi e d i n  the last years. Several variations to the original Apriori algorithm [1 as well as com p le tely d i f f eren t appro a ch es 
have been proposed[4,5,6  Al l t h e al g o r i t h m s pro p o s e d browse bottom-up the huge so lution search space, by exploiting various strategies for pruning it. Among these strategies, the most effective regards the exploitation of the downward closure property: if a k-itemset is frequent, then all of its k-1 -subsets have to be frequent as well. On the other hand, if a k-itemset is discovered to be infrequent then all its supersets will not be frequent as well. Thus when during browsing we discover an infrequent itemset I 
we can safely prune I and all its supersets. Moreover transactions which do not contain at least a frequent itemset can be deleted from the datasets since they cannot contribute to the support of any frequent itemset This property makes it possible to effectively mine sparse datasets, also with very low min supp thresholds Sparse datasets in fact cont ain transactions with weak correlations, and the downward closure property allows to strongly reduce the search space and the dataset itself as the execution progresses. On the other hand, dense datasets 
contain strongly related transactions, and are much harder to mine since only a few itemset s can be in this case pruned and the number of frequent itemsets grows very quickly while decreasing of the minimum support threshold. As a consequence, the mining task becomes rapidly intractable by traditional mining algorithms, which try to extract all the frequent itemsets Closed itemsets[7 m i n i n g is a so l u tion t o t h is prob lem   Closed itemsets are a small subset of frequent itemsets, but they represent exactly the same knowledge in a more succinct way. From the set of closed itemsets it is in fact 
straightforward to derive both the identities and supports of all frequent itemsets. Mining the closed itemsets is thus semantically equivalent to mine all frequent itemsets, but with the great advantage that closed itemsets are orders of magnitude fewer than frequent ones. Using closed itemsets we implicitly benefit from data correlations which allow to strongly reduce problem complexity. Moreover, association rules extracted from closed sets have been proved to be

Unlike Close and Pascal CLOSET performs depth ¯rst, column enumeration CLOSET uses a novel frequent pattern tree \(FP-structure for a compressed representation of the datasets. It then performs recursive computation of conditional tables to simulate the search on the column enumeration tree CLOSET is unable to handle long biological datasets because of two reasons. First the FP-tree is unable to give good compression for long rows. Second, there are too many combinations when performing column enumerations  provem e nt on CLOSET    However, CloSET+ must s can database two times This paper propose a novel algorithm called QCloSET which can mining Frequent closed itemsets with one database scanning. So it can reduce the I/O cost of database scanning in frequent closed itemsets mining evidently   2.  Related works 2.1  FP-growth: mining AFIS from FP-tree Han et al. proposed a data structure called frequent pattern tree or FP-Tree [9 FP-g ro w t h  min e s f r e qu ent itemsets from FP-Tree without generating candidate frequent itemsets. FP-Tree is an extension of prefix tree structure. Only frequent items have nodes in the tree. Each node contains the item’s label and its frequency. The paths from the root to the leaves are arranged according to the support of the items with the frequency of each parent is greater than or equal to the su m of its children’s frequency The construction of FP-Tree requires two data scans. In the first scan, the support of each item is found. In the second scan, items within transactions are sorted in descending order according to the support of items. If two transactions share a common prefix, the shared portion is merged and the frequencies of the nodes are incremented accordingly Nodes with the same label are connected with an item link The item link is used to facilitate frequent pattern mining In addition, each FP-Tree has a header that contains all frequent items and pointers to the beginning of their respective item links  Algorithm 1 FP-tree construction   Input: A transaction database DB and a minimum support threshold  Output: Its frequent pattern tree, FP-Tree Method: The FP-tree is constructed in the following steps 1. Scan the transaction database DB once. Collect the set of frequent items F and their supports. Sort F in support descending order as L, the list of frequent items 2. Create the root of an FP-tree, T, and label it as “null”, for each transaction in DB do the following. Select and sort the frequent items in transaction according to the order of L Let the sorted frequent item list in transaction be [p where p is the first element and P is the remaining list. Call    T Function insert_tree \([p|P   T If T has a child N such that N.item-name = p.item-name Then increment N’s count by 1 Else do {create a new node N N’s count = 1 N’s parent link be linked to T N’s node-link be linked to the nodes with the same item-name via the node-link structure If P is nonempty, Call insert_tree \(P, N  FP-growth partitions the FP-T ree based on the prefixes FP-growth traverses the paths of FP-Tree recursively to generate frequent itemsets. Pattern fragments are concatenated to ensure all fr equent itemsets are generated properly. In this way, FP-growth avoids the costly operations of generating and testing of candidate itemsets As pointed out by the authors of FP-Tree, no algorithm works in all situations. The fact holds true for FP-Tree when the dataset is sparse. When the data is sparse, the compression achieved by the FP-Tree is small and the FP-Tree is bushy. As a result, FP-growth would spend a lot of effort to concatenate fragmented patterns with no frequent itemsets being found   Algorithm 2 FP-growth: Mining frequent patterns with FP-tree by pattern fragment growth    Input: FP-tree, and a minimum support threshold  Output: The complete set of frequent patterns Method: call FP-growth\(FP-tree, null Procedure FP-growth\(Tree  if Tree contains a single prefix path P // Mining single prefix-path FP-tree  then for each combination \(denoted as the nodes in the path P do generate pattern   with support minimum support of nodes in   else   for  each item ai in Q, in the header of Tree  do Mining multipath FP-tree generate pattern ai  with support ai .support

CLOSET+: MINING CFIS from FP-tree To minie frequent closed itemsets from FP-trees CLOSET+[1 w a s p r op osed I t u s e t h e t o p do wn p s eu do  tree-projection and upward subset-checking for sparse datasets, whereas for dense datasets, the bottom-up physical tree-projection and a compressed result-tree have been adopted. The CLOSET+ algorithm is described as follows First, scan TDB once to find the global frequent items and sort them in support descending order. The sorted fre quent item list forms the f_list.  Second, scan TDB and build FP-tree using the f_list.  Third, With the divide-and-conquer and depth-first searching paradigm mine FP-tree for frequent clos ed itemsets in a top-down manner for sparse datasets or bottom-up manner for dense datasets. During the mining process, use the item merging item skipping, and sub-itemset pruning methods to prune search space. For each candidat e frequent closed itemset use the two-level hash indexed result tree method for dense datasets or pseudo-projection based upward checking method for sparse datasets to do closure checking. Finally stop when all the items in the global header table have been mined. The complete set of frequent closed item-sets can be found either from the result tree or the output file F 3 QCloSET+ : Mining frequent closed itemsets with one database scanning As analyzed above, it is obvious that Constructing FP-tree is the key step in FPtree based algorithms. FP-tree contains compressed message of frequent itemsets, it is easy to mining frequent itemsets from FP-tree. To construct FP-tree, we must scan data base twice, one for creating 1-itemset and one for build FP-tree. To mine useful information from database effectively, we needs to solve efficiency problem of mining,  when data quantity very large  efficiency of mining algorithm become the key of mining problem, to increase effi ciency of mining algorithm developing one database scanning algorithm is an effective policy In this section we present a algorithm to construct FP-tree with only one database scanning  First, we divide the datasets into n parts. For example Every part contains 1000 transactions. Then, for each part of database, we scan transaction data one time  read data into a memory buffer , create a local FP-tree and merge into result FP-tree. When the loop finished, the result FP-tree is the global FP-tree  We need not to create same node link for sub FP-Trees because it is only a local part of database we create same node link after all sub FP-Trees are merged into one FP-tree  Algorithm 3 QFPC: Quick FP-tree Constructing Algorithm Input: A transaction database DB and a minimum support threshold  Output: Its frequent pattern tree, FP-Tree Method: The FP-tree is constructed in the following steps T=NULL,T1= NULL,T2=NULL Divide database into n parts averagely. For example Every part contains 1000 transactions For I=1 to n DO Scan the  part\(I\of database, read the transactions into buffer, Collect the set of items F and their supports Sort F in support descending order as L Create local FP-tree as T1 FP_Merge\(T,T1,T2  merge T1 and T2 into T T1=T2,T2=T,T=T1 //swap T,T2 T1= NULL,T2=NULL  Prune the items from T where its support is less then  Create same node link for T Return T   Algorithm 4 FP-merge FP-tree merging algorithm, do not create head table and node link in result FP-tree Input: Two sub FP-trees  Output: a merged FP-tree named FP-tree<result Method: call FP-merge\( result, FP-tree1, FP-tree2 Procedure FP-merge\(result FP-tree1, FP-tree2:FP-TREE Count the item support number from FP-tree1 and FP-tree2 and sort the items in descending order,insert into head table of result   while FP-tree1 !=NULL, do   retrieve one item train in FP-tree1 from leaf to root     sort the items in descending order of head table n=leaf’s count Let the item train be [p wh ere p is th e last ele m en t  and P is the frontal list  Call merge-insert \([p lt, n       Remove the item train from FP-tree1   while FP-tree2 !=NULL, do   retrieve one item train in FP-tree2 from leaf to root     sort the items in descending order of head table

All the experiments were performed on Pentium 4 1.8GHz PC with 512Mb RAM running on Window XP. Datasets are generated with the data generator by IBM QUEST. FP-growth is provided by the original authors. All programs are complied with the same compiler. Experimental results show that QPFC and QFP-growth are competitive. It is efficient and scalable for mining large databases or data warehouses. See figure 10 to 11  Figure 10. Memory Comparison of QFP-growth and FP-growth                             Figure 11.

some are best for dense type datasets Currently there is no single algorithm exist that shows global best performance on all types of datasets The main limitation of previous algorithms is that they really upon only single strategy and do no combine the best features of multiple strategies for speedup the process of itemset mining In this paper we show that combining the best features of multiple strategies into a single hybrid is more beneficial and efficient than relying upon single strategy Our different experimental results on benchmark datasets show that mining all and maximal frequent itemsets using our hybrid approach is more efficient than existing algorithms and gives global best performance 13 T Uno M Kiyomi H Arimura LCM ver 3 Collaboration of Array Bitmap and Prefix Tree for Frequent Itemset Mining In 1st Int'l Workshop on Open Source Data Mining in conjunction with SIGKDD2005 2005 14 M J Zaki and C Hsiao Charm An efficient algorithm for closed association rule mining In Technical Report 99-10 Computer Science Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 1999 8 References 1 R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc ACMSIGMOD Int'l Conf Management of Data pp 207-216 May 1993 2 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc Int'l Conf Very Large Data Bases pp 487-499 Sept 1994 3 S Bashir A Rauf Baig HybridMiner Mining Maximal Frequent Itemsets using Hybrid Database Representation Appraoch In Proc of 10th IEEE-INMIC conference Karachi Pakistan 2005 4 D Burdick M Calimlim and J Gehrke Mafia A maximal frequent itemset algorithm for transactional databases In Proc ofICDE Conf pp 443-452 2001 5 Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations B Goethals and M.J Zaki eds CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 http:HCEURWS.org/Vol-90 6 K Gouda and M J Zaki Efficiently mining maximal frequent itemsets In ICDM pp 163-170 2001 7 G Grahne and J Zhu Efficiently Using Prefix-trees in Mining Frequent Itemsets In Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations 2003 8 J Han J Pei and Y Yin Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation In SIGMOD pages 1-12 2000 9 J Liu Y Pan K Wang and J Han Mining frequent item sets by opportunistic projection In Proc of KDD Conf 2002 10 G Liu H Lu Y Xu and J X Yu Ascending frequency ordered prefix-tree Efficient mining of frequent patterns In DASFAA 2003 11 J Pei J Han H Lu S Nishio S Tang and D Yang HMine Hyper-structure mining of frequent patterns in large databases In Proc of ICDMConf pp 441.448 2001 12 A Pietracaprina and D Zandolin Mining Frequent Itemsets Using Patricia Tries Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 243 


The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels. Note that the manager\222s method 223browse\224 cannot read the worker\222s \223work_hour\224 and \223hour_pay\224. The rationale is described in the last paragraph of section 4.4 Requirement 3 If a worker is not assigned to a manager, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223not_assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker not assigned to a manager, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. The statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels Requirement 4 If a worker and a manager are friends, they can read each other\222s general information This requirement is achieved by the labels with the association \223friend\224. For example, a worker can read his manager friend\222s general information through the worker\222s method 223get_others_general_info\224, which invokes the manager\222s \223get_self_general_info\224 using the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. After comparing the label of the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 and the manager\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, one can see that the secure flow condition is true. The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the manager\222s method \223get_self_general_info;\224 can be executed Requirement 5 Periodically, the company invokes foreign objects to compute the salaries and taxes of workers This requirement is fulfilled by the stubs \223stub1\224 and stub2\224 in Example 1. Please refer to the description in section 4.3. Moreover, the three rules mentioned in section 3.2 prevent the foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses  7. Evaluation  We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. The system uses reusable software repository to simulate foreign object control. Moreover, it uses the language shown in Example 1 to write programs A program written in the language is first pre-processed to produce a program without labels and MLs. The program produced by the preprocessor is conceptually composed of two parts. One is the program before labeling and the other a security monitor The latter checks information flows of the former using Algorithm 1 during program execution Currently, the security monitor checks security dynamically, which contradicts the proposal of static checking [1, 12, 24  N e ve r t he l e ss d yna mi c c he c ki n g  cannot be totally avoided because objects and AGs may be dynamically instantiated or removed during program execution To evaluate the model, we used the example described in section 2 as an assignment to students of different grades and experiences. The students are required to develop a program, namely program a  without the proposed model embedded and another program, namely program b with the model embedded. We then collected and averaged the following metrics data: 1\ LOC \(lines of code\f programs a and b, 2\ecution time of programs a and b, and 3\numbers of non-secure statements found in program b. The collected data showed that the averaged LOC and execution time of program b are respectively 3.2 and 3.8 times those of program a Nevertheless, the data also showed that 2.3 non-secure information flows \(per 100 LOC\n average are identified from program b. Although the runtime overhead seems high, we still think that the model is valuable because of the ability to identify non-secure statements. Nevertheless, reducing the overhead should be an important future work  8. Related work  The simplest information flow control approach is DAC. Since DAC fails to avoid Trojan horses, the multilevel security approach was proposed [6-9  The approach is generally categorized as MAC MAC was criticized as too restricted [5 T o lo o s en  the restriction, quite a few approaches have been proposed. Below we survey some researches The model proposed in t rol s t h e  information flows in object-oriented systems. It uses ACL of objects to compute the ACL of executions. A message filter is used to filter out possibly non-secure information flows. Since the computation of an execution\222s ACL takes information propagation into consideration, no Trojan horses will result Moreover, interactions among executions are categorized into five modes including synchronized unrestricted, synchronous restricted, asynchronous deferred reply unrestricted, and deferred reply restricted. Different modes result in different ACLs Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 


which loosens the restriction of MAC. More flexibility is added to the model by allowing exceptions during or after method execution [10-11 The purpose-oriented model [21-22 pro pos es  that invoking a method may be allowed for some methods but disallowed for other methods, even when the invokers belong to the same object. This consideration is correct, because the security levels of methods in an object may be different Different methods can thus access information in different security levels The decentralized label approach [1-4 m a rk s t h e  security levels of variables using labels. A label is composed of one or more policies, which should be simultaneously obeyed. A policy in a label is composed of an owner and zero or more readers that are allowed to access the data. When computation are applied to data, join operation is used to compute the label of the result data. This avoids Trojan horses Another feature proposed by this approach is that declassification \(downgrading of security level provided. This allows non-sensitive data, which are in high security level, to be accessed by low security level processes. The model also takes write access control into consideration [4 rren t l y t h e m o d e l  has been used to develop a programming language Jflow [1 ad d itio n   th e m o d e l h a s b e e n  u s ed i n a  distributed system with untrusted hosts through secure program partitioning [30  Role-based access control models [19, 27, 33  define the roles a subject can play. A role is a collection of permissions \(i.e., access rights  When a subject plays a role, it possesses the rights belonging to the role. A subject can play multiple roles and even change role during a session Inheritance and other relationships can be established among roles [27 t o s t ru ct u re t h e m Moreov er  constraints, such as two specific roles should be mutually exclusive, can be attached to roles. The advantage of role-based access control is that subjects can change roles dynamically, which facilitates obeying the \223need-to-know\224 principle. It seems that the role-based models operate well in an application that protects not too many resources because roles should be defined before the application\222s execution. In case that many resources should be protected \(such as every variable in a program should be protected\ining roles becomes tedious and the access control may become imprecise From the survey, we identified many necessary features for controlling information flows in object-oriented systems such as Trojan horse prevention, declassification, purpose-oriented method invocation, and so on. In fact, our model offers those features, although we do not present them in this paper. What we present in this paper are the control of information flows among objects and foreign objects. According to our survey, no model offers the control well  9. Conclusions  This paper proposes a model to control information flows among objects. The model uses associations and method limitations \(ML\ to control information flows among objects. Information flows are controlled by attaching labels to variables. Trojan horses are avoided by join operations. Within an application, every variable and literal is associated with one or more labels. If a variable is associated with multiple labels, each label enforces the security policy of an association. To check the security of an information flow, labels are compared. An information flow is secure if the comparison causes the secure flow condition true In addition to controlling objects developed by programmers, the model also controls foreign objects which are pre-existing objects for reused. Since the details of a foreign object are unknown, our model only prevents foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses. We use the \223Suppression rule\224, \223No ML rule\224 and \223Stuck to rules\224 to control foreign objects We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. From the data collected, we found that the model does facilitate identifying non-secure information flows. We thus believe that the model is useful in spite of runtime overhead  Acknowledgement  This research is sponsored by the National Science Council in Taiwan under Grant NSC91-2213-E-259-006  References  1  A  C.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned. Given two patterns p1 = \(pid1, s1, d1,m1, f1 p2 = \(pid2, s2, d2,m2, f2 p1, p2 ned as the pattern p with the following components Structure : cStructureSchema\(s1, s2 Data : cDataSchema\(d1, d2 Measure : cMeasureSchema\(m1,m2 Formula : cformula\(f1, f2 The join of c1 and c2 with respect to the join predicate F and the composition function c, denoted by c 1   F  c  c 2   i s  n o w  d e  n e d  a s  f o l l o w s    F  c  c 2     c  p 1   p 2   p 1    c 1  p 2    c 2  F   p 1   p 2     t r u e   5.1.3.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type. The pattern-covering operator, denoted as ?p\(c,D all patterns in c representing D. More formally p\(c,D t.a1, ..., t.an true Note that: ?p\(c,D p,D 6. Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
