relationês conceptual model to demonstrate MongoDB. In the the documentês collection of MongoDB is a table, and the tableês structure is the moment of calculation, the tableês be defined in the tableês every tuple. Every value in the table               
We will provide the operations of relational algebra precise definition in section V of this paper, combining with the specific concepts of MongoDB IV T HE R ELATIONAL M ODEL OF M ONGO DB MongoDB is a document-oriented database system. A MongoDB system can have several instances of database. And a database instance could have many collections, which are comprised of different documents. Every document is composed by a series of interrelated keys. The collection does not have a predefined schema. To be specific, the keys in two documents can be quite different With such data structure mentioned above, we use the macro level, collections in MongoDB do not have similar fixed schema as relational model. In other words, the schema in a collection can be changed at any time. In such a situation if  we cannot determine the schema at time even though knowing the schema at time However, in the micro level, the schema can be considered fixed. To be specific, the schema at time is the same with the schema at time where That is, in such a moment, the schema of a collection could be decided In the situation of model in MongoDB is the same with the relational model in relational database system. A collection is matching along with a table of a relational database. One document is like one tuple in a table, and the keys ar e similar to the fields in the table. There are no substantial differences between them In conclusion, the relational model of MongoDB is: The changeable in the macro level but fixed in the micro level. In schema is composed by all keys in the document. All the keys in the document would is corresponding to a value of a key. The value will be null if the document does not have a corresponding key. The model could be presented in the chart I Chart I Mapping From Set to Table Additionally, the documents in the collection are not quite simple in many situations. Documents could be embedded or linked in other documents. For example, document Book_A is embedded into the document Order_A we call the document Book_A Child Document, and the document Order_A Father Document. When this Father Document is mapping to the relational model, the document would be flattening. That is, keys in Child Document would be added a prefix before it becomes a field in the table. The prefix would be the name of the key which Child Document embedded in the Father Document Moreover, we would face such a situation: there is not only one Child Document in a Father Document, for example document Book_A and document Book_B are embedded in the document Order_A The method mentioned above could not work, because the keys in each Child Document would be the same in the Father Document, which is not permitted in the relational table Another viable solution is using the prefix which is consistent of the previous prefix and the id of the Child Document. With this solution the problem can be solved easily. So the new key of a Child Document would be in the following format: [superkey _[_id  childk e y   Follo w i ng is  an example of the flattening

Chart II Flattening Mapping It should be noticed that because the document does not have a predefined schema, the mapped table would be sparse When a collection is mapping to a table in the relational model, the table would be extremely large, with many empty values not map into the table. Specially, when the values in Child Documents do not participate in the calculation, the flattening is unnecessary; the Child Document can be shown as a DBRef V R ELATIONAL A LGEBRA IN M ONGO DB As discussed previously, there ar e six primitive operators in relational algebra, and other operations can be deduced through these primitive operators According to the relational model proposed above, we could define the six basic operators of relational algebra in MongoDB s collection Assuming that two operands are union-compatible, given two collections C and T in MongoDB, the definition of the union set is where C and T are union-compatible It is similar with union set. Given two collections C and T the definition of the different set is where C and T are union-compatible A selection is a unary operation that extracts certain documents contending the given condition from a collection where is the query condition, for example  The definition of the Cartesian product in relational algebra is different from that in set th eory. Tuples are considered to be shallow' for the purposes of the operation. That is, the Cartesian product of an n-tuple by an m-tuple has the 2-tuple flattened" into an \(n + m\-tuple In set theory, the Cartesian product is a set of 2-tupl e. The definition is Supposed that R has n tuples and S has m tuples, the result of has tuples Projection is to acquire certain keys and its values in the collection according to the given attr ibute set, and the result of the projection is a new collection is one key in the collection C Note that because two identical documents cannot be in one collection, although duplicate records would be appeared in the procedure of project operation, the final outcome of projection would be distinct During the operation, every key has its own name in each collection, and we can obtain its value through its name. But in the query of more than one collection, same key names would be defined in different collection, or when we want to rename certain keys in the result of the relational calculation we need the rename operation to rename the keys and do not change any values. Follo wing is its definition The set which contains the new names of the keys in the collection T and C, is the result of the rename operation. The relation T and C have the same documents values but some different key names. To the keys whose names do not define in  their names do not change after the operation Aside from the six primitiv e operators, there are some notable operatiors that can be deduced from them For the collection C and T where C and T are union-compatible As mentioned above, intersection can be defined by a different set. To the universal set C and are complementary so Conditional Join is to join more than one collection that satisfies a specific condition that the result of the conditional join is a subset of Cartesian product. The definition is where p is the condition

Natural join is a peculiar condition of conditional join. It is demanded that the two documents in collection C and T could not be joined unless the keys with the same names in both documents have the same value. It is defined by the symbol  where and represents the keys with the same name in both relations Although division is not very common in the database query, it is a useful operator of relational algebra. Following is the definition of the division of collection C and T Assuming that the collection C has keys x and y, T only has key y, toany value of the key y in S and the value of key x in C, if   is contained in C, then  That is C/T is the collection of that meet the requirement above To the does not meet the requirement, it can be defined as So To the situation that there are more keys in C and T, x represents the keys only exist in C and y represents the keys exist in both C and T According to the implementations above, MongoDB can support all the six primitive oper ators of relational algebra In the next section, we are going to testify the feasibility of the immigration from SQL to MongoDB VI O PERATION OF M ONGO DB After the demonstration above, we can model the data query capability of MongoDB, using the relational algebra The implementation would be considered in two situations in MongoDB single sharding and multiple sharding, to be specific, the two differ ent extended patterns Single sharding means that the whole MongoDB is deployed on only one computer and it is the only node of the database. The execution of the MongoDB operations is straightforward as all the evaluation of the queries is performed on a single node Find is the querying command of MongoDB, equivalent to SELECT command in SQL. Following is its command example db.clltn.find\({p}, {k1:1, k2:1 km:1 It means to get a collection constituted by documents in the collection clltn which satisfy the condition p, and documents in the new collection only have the key-value pairs whose key is contained in the set  We can achieve this query by the following relational algebra In the query, C is the collection; p is the query condition and is the key which need to be extracted. The result of the query is a collection of documen ts that consist of key-value pairs, and the key-values are using as their keys Distinct is an aggregation command of MongoDB. It is used to query all the values of the given key. For the following command db.cllctn.distinct or db.runCommand cllctn  we can get all the values of key k in the collection cllctn And it can be defined by following relational algebra In the equation is not a relational calculus. It is just a formatting for the query result. And it should be noticed that the result of the query would not have key=Group is another aggregation command of MongoDB, that is equal to GROUP BY command in SQL. To the following command The command divides the documents in the collection into groups according to key k and documents with same key k s value would be merged by the function defined in reduce The operation will return the result of reduce Following is the relational algebra calculation of the operation  1 2. For 3 To support more complicate group queries, MongoDB defines more parameters for them. For example, the parameter condition only allows the documents that meet the requirement of p to be contained in the operation; the parameter finalize provide the function to process the result For an instance

The command Group\(C, k, reduce, p, finalize\ has the following equivalent relational algebra calculation 1 2 3 For 4 In the relational database, Join is a widely used operation By using Join, relational database increases its flexibility of querying and enlarges its scope of application But to our disappointment, MongoDB could not support Join yet. However, we are go ing to use relational algebra to achieve the Join operation fo r MongoDB, to increase the efficiency of query and to make it support more complicate queries Following is the definition To the collection C and T Let s consider a common scene when using MongoDB, sometimes we need to query two collections to get the result we want, just like It is doubtless that we need to conduct two querying to obtain the result, and it is in poor efficiency. With relational algebra, we can use a Join to achieve the result where means the keys of the collection Customers Load balancing is an essential feature of MongoDB. That is MongoDB can increase or remove its nodes on its clusters on the basis of its requirements When there is more than one node in the MongoDB, data in a collection would be split and distributed across multiple shards to accomplish the goal of load balancing. This operation is called sharding in MongoDB Assuming that the collection C h as n shards, we can define  Following we will provide the realization of relational algebra in the multiple sharding pattern On the basis of the discussion above, we can conclude that  so is the shards of the collection C, restoring in different nodes The distinct operation is similar with Find operation. What we need to do is to find out all the values in each shard, to integrate the values and to delete the reduplicate ones According to the discussion above When  In the equation is not a relational calculus, it is just a format for the query result. Something should be noticed that the result of queries has no keyIn the discussion about Group above, we mentioned two situations. In fact, the first situation could be contained in the second one. So we just consid er the second situation here To the collection with multiple sharding following is the relational alge bra calculation of the operation Group\(C, k, reduce, p, finalize 1 2 3 For

4 To the collection C and T When   VII C ONCLUSION Based on the relational model proposed above, MongoDB can support relational calculus ju st like relational database system. We are certain that they have the same capability set Therefore, we can get to the co nclusion that theoretically data can be migrated from SQL to MongoDB safely and easily NoSQL databases have beco me a popular alternative to traditional SQL databases, especiall y in the scenario where extremely large scale of data needed to be managed. The adoption of NoSQL solutions is called for theoretical and technical supports on evaluation of the solutions, comparison with SQL solutions and optimization of NoSQL solutions The contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, we identify the need for theories and methods to support evaluation of NoSQL solutions, comparison of NoSQL solutions with RDBMS. Secondly, we model MongoDB with relational algebra, allowing the understanding and analysis of MongoDB independent of the actual implementation Thirdly we prove the migration s feasibility of traditional SQL applications to MongoDB The current research suggests th at it is possible to provide mappings between MongoDB and RDBMS. To be specific given a RDBMS instance with its relation design, it is possible to construct a MongoDB instance that provides the same data management and query features as the RDBMS instance does This work is the first attempt to investigate and understand NoSQL database formally, focusing on the mathematical modeling of MongoDB. For the comparison of MongoDB and RDBMS, the mathematic model of MongoDB is constructed with relational algebra, which is also the primary model of RDBMS Further work includes the improvement of the current model as well as the investigation of automatic transformation of RDBMS designs into MongoDB designs. The optimization of MongoDB design is also of interest to us VIII A CKNOWLEDGEMENT Research supported in part by the Guangzhou Research Infrastructure Development Fund \(No. 2012224-12\ the Guangdong Nature Science Fund \(No. S2012030006242\he Guangdong-CAS Cooperation Fund \(No. 2011A090100003 the Guang-dong Emerging Industry Key Technology R&D Fund \(No. 2011A010801007\e Guangzhou Zhujiang Science and Technology Future Fellow Fund \(No 2011J2200089\, and the MOE-China Mobile Research Fund No. MCM20121051 R EFERENCES 1 E  F   C o d d  19 70  A rela t i o n a l m o del of d a t a for la rge s h a r ed d a ta  banks

tionship between beer brands and customers Our proposed criterion played an important role in determining the number of clusters in this analysis We nally compare our proposed criterion with other ones For example AIC discovered four customer clusters and the customer behavior suggested by each cluster is rather different from that given by NML ICL selected only ve brand clusters whereas results of NML also distinguished brand clusters B and E Each of these results shows certain aspects of the data but we emphasize that the model selection results given by NML are justiìed from the perspective of data compression VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have addressed the issue of statistical model selection in GRD modeling From the viewpoint of the MDL principle we have clariìed the asymptotic property of NML in GRD modeling and have proposed a new model selection criterion We have applied our proposed criterion to the issue of model selection in SBM learning and have derived a new and efìcient method of calculating the NML code-length for SBM The effectiveness of our NML-based criterion has been demonstrated experimentally using artiìcial data and real beer-purchase data Thus for the rst time we have realized a model selection technique that considers the statistical characteristics of GRD models We will extend our discussion to other problems and criteria A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partially supported by MEXT KAKENHI 23240019 by the Aihara Project the FIRST program from JSPS initiated by CSTP by HAKUHODO Inc and by MACROMILL Inc R EFERENCES  B Long Z Zhang and P  S Y u  Relational Data Clustering Models Algorithms and Applications  Chapman  Hall/CRC 2010  T  Roos T  Silander  P  K ontkanen and P  Myllymaki Bayesian network structure learning using factorized NML universal models in Information Theory and Applications Workshop  Feb 2008 pp 272 276  P  K ontkanen P  Myllym  aki W Buntine J Rissanen and H Tirri An MDL framework for data clustering in Advances in Minimum Description Length Theory and Applications  MIT Press 2005  A T  Cemgil Bayesian inference for nonne gati v e matrix factorisation models Intell Neuroscience  vol 2009 pp 4:1Ö4:17 Jan 2009  H Akaik e  A ne w look at the statistical model identiìcation  IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control  vol 19 no 6 pp 716  723 Dec 1974  G E Schw arz Estimating the dimension of a model  Annals of Statistics  vol 6 pp 461Ö464 1978  E M Airoldi D M Blei S E Fienber g and E P  Xing Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels J Mach Learn Res  vol 9 pp 1981Ö2014 Jun 2008  J Rissanen Modeling by shortest data description  Automatica  vol 14 no 5 pp 465  471 1978   Fisher information and stochastic comple xity   IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 42 no 1 pp 40 47 Jan 1996  Y  M Shtark o v  Uni v ersal sequential coding of single messages Problems of Information Transmission  vol 23 no 3 pp 3Ö17 1987  S Hirai and K Y amanishi Ef cient computation of normalized maximum likelihood coding for Gaussian mixtures with its applications to optimal clustering in Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ISIT  Aug 2011 pp 1031 1035  J Rissanen MDL denoising  IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 46 no 7 pp 2537 2543 Nov 2000  Y  Hayashi and K Y amanishi Sequential netw ork change detection with its applications to ad impact relation analysis in IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ICDM2012  2012 pp 280Ö289  T  A Snijders and K No wicki Estimation and prediction for stochastic blockmodels for graphs with latent block structure Journal of Classiìcation  vol 14 pp 75Ö100 1997  N Friedman L Getoor  D  K oller  and A Pfef fer  Learning probabilistic relational models in Proceedings of the 16th international joint conference on Artiìcial intelligence  vol 2 1999 pp 1300Ö1307  J.-J Daudin F  Picard and S Robin A mixture model for random graphs Statistics and Computing  vol 18 no 2 pp 173Ö183 2008  C K emp J B T enenbaum T  L Grif ths T  Y amada and N Ueda Learning systems of concepts with an inìnite relational model in Proceedings of the 21st national conference on Artiìcial intelligence  2006 pp 381Ö388  C S W allace and P  R Freeman Estimation and inference by compact coding Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B Methodological  vol 49 no 3 pp pp 240Ö265 1987  C Biernacki G Celeux and G Go v aert  Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence IEEE Transactions on  vol 22 no 7 pp 719Ö725 2000  H Jef fre ys  A n i n v ariant form for the prior probability in estimation problems in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series A Mathematical and Physical Sciences  vol 186 no 1007 1946 pp 453Ö461  I S Dhillon S Mallela and D S Modha Informationtheoretic co-clustering in Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  2003 pp 89Ö98 429

and emotional topic, it is not a top priority for US foreign policy  This paper has multiple limitations on its research. The datasets included are only for the three most recent female Secretar ies of State and cannot be used to generalize an overall US foreign policy message. Also, there is a gap between the three female Secretaries filled by Secretary of State Colin Powell. For purposes of this paper, and in order to keep gender consistent across all datasets, Secretary Powell was not included Another limitation is the lack of keyword in context analysis. Although these keywords and phrases are important due to their number of times used, as well as their appearance in a large percentage of cases, their context may differ. Further analysis of these important keywords and phrases will lead to deeper insights and more complex nuances  This study is an initial analysis on three separate datasets. Further contextual analysis can lead to deeper understandings of the frequently occurring keywords and phrases that are predominant from each Secretary. Keyword in context analysis will provide further unpacking a nd clearer definitions of what each keyword or phrase means when the Secretary uses it. A prior crosstabs analysis on the Secretary Clinton dataset provided further clues to the evolution of keywords and phrases over time and geography. This analysis will be completed on Secretary Rice and Secretary Albrightês datasets as well. Future analysis will include Secretary Powellês tenure from 2001-2005 in order to see if his themes are consistent with those before and after his term Future research will also include the final two approaches from the ASSANA Methodology traditional hand coding as well as the High Performance Computing Environment. Incorporating these other approaches will allow for a full review of the differences in findings and time for analysis between each approach
