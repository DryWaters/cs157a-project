Ground Truth For Pedestrian Analysis and Application to Camera Calibration\nClement Creusot\nToshiba R&D Center\nKawasaki, Japan\nclementcreusot@gmail.com\nNicolas Courty\nIRISA-UBS\nVannes France\nncourty@gmail.com\nAbstract\nThis paper investigates the use of synthetic 3D scenes\nto generate ground truth of pedestrian segmentation in 2D\ncrowd video data. Manual segmentation of objects in videos\nis indeed one of the most time-consuming type of assisted\nlabeling. A big gap in computer vision research can not\nbe lled due to this lack of temporally dense and precise\nsegmentation ground truth on large video samples Such\ndata is indeed essential to introduce machine learning tech-\nniques for automatic pedestrian segmentation, as well as\nmany other applications involving occluded people. We\npresent a new dataset of 1.8 million pedestrian silhouettes\npresenting human-to-human occlusion patterns likely to be\nseen in real crowd video data. To our knowledge, it is the\n?rst publicly available large dataset of pedestrian in crowd\nsilhouettes. Solutions to generate and represent this data\nare detailed. We discuss ideas of how this ground truth can\nbe used for a large number of computer vision applications\nand demonstrate it on a camera calibration toy problem.\n1. Introduction\nComputer vision problems related to scene understand-\ning are so complex that they generally cannot be solved us-\ning human-designed heuristics. The main breakthroughs in\nlast few decades has always been triggered by the introduc-\ntion of new \(or old detect\nand recognize those objects. This kind of approach is not\nfully satisfying as the learning is often object-speci?c \(i.e.\nit will only detect one object class: face, body, eye, car, and\nso on these techniques have been very ef-\n?cient at solving a wide range of problems and have found\nmany real-world applications in industry. One of the prac-\ntical caveats with learning techniques is that a consequent\namount of training data is required. In some cases it is pos-\nsible to provide that ground-truth data manually or semi-\nautomatically. This can be done either by a small group of\npeople or by crowd sourcing \(e.g. [2 labeling problem.\nUnfortunately, it is most of the time unpractical to use ei-\nther of these human-in-the-loop” techniques. Some of the\nmain obstacles to produce human-supervised ground-truth\nare the lack of ef?cient semi-automatic labeling methods,\ntraining size requirements that make even simple monitor-\ning/correction approaches too costly, and labeling quality\nrequirements since intra and inter-human repeatability is not\nalways tight enough.\nHere we encounter a classic dead-lock problem where\nthe data needed to design an automatic labeling system can\nnot be reasonably obtained without an automatic labeling\nsystem in the ?rst place. We propose to break that loop by\nusing synthetic data to produce a ?rst large set of ground\ntruth silhouettes. We expect that it will help the develop-\nment of better segmentation methods that in turn can be\nused to extract ground truth data from real video scenes with\nlimited supervision.\nIn the next sections we detail the problem and related\nwork on the subject before presenting the dataset and how it\nwas generated. We then demonstrate on a toy problem how\nthis data can be used to answer new questions and discuss\nthe many possible applications this data can be used for.\n2. Related Work\nMost benchmarking videos used for pedestrian track-\ning offer no ground truth segmentation. The data usually\nprovided consists of labeled rectangular bounding boxes\naround each pedestrian occurrence. A few datasets come\nwith ground truth segmentation like [4] and [5], however\nthe ground truth is only given for a few frames in the se-\nquence. This is already praiseworthy as manually segment-\ning video is a very time-consuming task. It appears that no\nvideo dataset provides temporally dense segmentation. It\nhas to be noted that there is no ef?cient tool to manually\nsegment video. Some tools designed for tracking provide\nsome contour detection functionality \(e.g 9 of\nground truth segmentation for 2D videos \(e.g. [3 information is\nindeed very easy.

However it has not been\nused for pedestrian video datasets. Indeed, active 3D vision\n\(e.g structured light outdoor\nscenes. Passive 3D vision reconstruction \(e.g. stereo vi-\nsion dealing with uniform\ntexture. In conclusion, there is no easy way to perform ma-\nchine learning research on pedestrian segmentation for now\nand the main limiting reason is the lack of data. Using 3D\nsynthetic human models to help computer vision applica-\ntions is not a new idea. It was used in [10] for gait analysis\napplications, in [11] and [14] for action recognition using\nsilhouettes, and in [13] to train the Microsoft Kinect body\npose recognition system. To our knowledge, the dataset pre-\nsented here is the ?rst to provide individual pedestrian seg-\nmentation for crowded scenes and probably represents one\nof the largest 


human silhouette collections available to re-\nsearchers.\n3. Crowd Generation\nOur dataset has followed the same guidelines for its\ncreation as the recent synthetic crowd dataset AGO-\nRASET [1]. In this setting, 25 different avatars were used\nto produce an animation of four groups of 16 people going\nin opposite directions In the middle of the crossing, a tan-\ngled pattern emerges as each pedestrian is trying to ?nd his\nway through the crowd. The simulation model is a varia-\ntion of Helbing’s social force model [1] which guarantees\nthat each pedestrian’s path is collision free. Regarding the\ndifferent avatars’ animations, a walking motion capture ?le\nwas used to drive the pedestrian skeletons. The playback\nspeed for this motion was dynamically adjusted so as to\nmatch the current pedestrians velocities. The rendering was\nperformed thanks to the commercially available Maya soft-\nware. The rendering setup was adjusted so as to cancel any\nanti-aliasing lters that would have impaired the quality of\nthe segmentation. As depicted in Figure 2, several cameras\nwere positioned so as to render the different views of this\nscene. Using a simple polar parametrization, the azimuth\nFigure 2. Simulated crossing scene along with the 64 camera con-\n?gurations used to obtain the dataset.\nand elevation angles distribution was discretized along a\n8 × 8 grid. As a result, 250 frames were rendered through\n64 cameras. In order to generate the silhouette, the scene is\nrendered with each pedestrian represented with plain colors.\nThe colors are de?ned as a function of the pedestrian id in\nsuch way that any two pedestrian colors differ signi?cantly\nand so that the inverse function is robust to noise. The in-\nverse color function is used on the virtual camera output\nto produce 16-bit gray-level images where each pixel value\ncorresponds to the pedestrian id. A 16-bit representation\nwas chosen to allow more than 255 pedestrians in future\nscenes.\n4. Dataset content\nExtracting each individual silhouette from the global 16-\nbit mask is straightforward using thresholding ?lters on\npixel values. The resulting image can be trimmed to a mini-\nmal bounding box and saved. Since all the parameters of the\nscene are known, we can also output for each pedestrian the\n70713\n?Figure 3.

We select the occluder as being the one closer\nto the camera in that view using the absolute coordinates\nof the pedestrians \(provided with the database border get an addi-\ntional occluder of label -1. This can be used to easily split\nthe database into occluded and non occluded masks. The\noccluders’ metadata is provided with the dataset.\nFrom the 64 different views of 64 pedestrians in 250\ndifferent frames, we obtain 903,103 non-empty pedestrian\nmasks. Since the mirror image of each mask is also a valid\nmask we end up with 1,806,206 individual silhouettes. In\nthis dataset, 808,666 of the 1.8 million silhouettes are non-\noccluded. The complete set of silhouettes is shown as a sin-\ngle 3.7 billions pixels pyramidal image on the ?rst author’s\nwebsite 1. Figure 1 shows a sample zoom on the dataset.\nIn addition to the 16-bit images, a number of other\nground-truth data is provided with the dataset The bound-\ning boxes for each pedestrian in each frame, their position,\ndirection and speed in the global space referential, the skele-\nton data, the list of occluders for each pedestrian and for\neach camera, the association between avatar and pedestrian,\nthe vertical angle for each pedestrian in each view \(see sec-\nond part of the article Using People Shapes\nIs it possible to determine some camera parameters by\nonly using the shape of the people in the video? In this\nsection we present a toy problem where we try to ?nd the\ntilt angle view ? of one camera upon a crowded scene, even\nif only a single frame is given \(see Figure 3 to demonstrate the usefulness of our\nproposed ground-truth data to allow existing problems to be\nsolved with original data-driven approaches.\n1http://clementcreusot.com/pedestrian/\n5.1. Simpli?cation\nThe toy problem presented here only focuses on one\ncamera calibration parameter \(the tilt angle of the camera\nrelative to the oor camera to the ground cannot be done without measuring\nsomething in the scene. This can be achieved by using a\ndistribution of human heights or other techniques but it has\nno direct interest for our demonstration Similarly the roll\nof the camera around his axis can be determined for low an-\ngle views by detecting vertical direction in the scene \(like\nupright humans the camera is upright.\nCamera parameters are divided in two categories: Intrin-\nsic \(like the focal length principal point and image for-\nmat\(dimension of the sensor area like the\nposition and orientation relative to other referentials distortions\nwould not in any case matter for the type of scene and pre-\ncision we are targeting. In practice the intrinsic parameters\ndo not cause many dif?culties since most of them do not\nchange over time \(like the sensor size 


we consider the focal length to be ?xed.\nNote that when the view angle is retrieved, the focal length\ncan be approximated using the formula in Figure 6 over a\nlarge set of silhouettes. This is not discussed here.\nThe main issue in uncontrolled environments are the ex-\ntrinsic parameters. The position and orientation of the sen-\nsors is dif?cult to determine in large scale environment and,\nalso, might change over time. Here the camera angle re-\ntrieved is relative to the ground ?oor and is positive, i.e. we\nconsider the tilt angle of the camera rather than its pitch.\nNote that in real life situations, getting the pedestrians’\nsilhouettes using a simple 2D camera is very dif?cult. Here\nwe ?rst evaluate what the calibration performance would be\nif the segmentation problem was solved.\n5.2. Rapid background\nThe idea of calibrating cameras using pedestrians is not\nnew. Indeed, in most cases the aim of camera networks is\nto monitor people. Trying to use pedestrians as calibration\ndevices is therefore a natural endeavor. Usually, calibra-\ntion using pedestrians is done using the known or assumed\nheights of individuals in the picture [6][8][7]. In [6], the\nmain assumption made is that the height of one person is\nstable throughout the gait motion. If the ?oor is ?at and the\ncamera still, you can draw the projection of parallel lines\n\(in the 3D scene the bottom foot points of a single subject between frame\np and q. Repeating this allows to get vanishing points that in\nturn can be used to determine the camera parameters. This\nfoot-head homology method is interesting but can only be\n70814\n? 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n?y 13.6 27.3 40.4 53.0 64.7 75.8 86.4 96.9\nFigure 4. Variations in pedestrian shape at position \(x, y foot-head vector for\nhigh tilt angle view is impossible using naive top/bottom pixels\nselection.\nused in very restricted conditions. First you need to track\nthe individual within the video to be able to create those\nparallel lines and this can be a challenging task. Second,\nyou need to determine the segment representing the per-\nson’s height \(top and bottom point become impossible when the view tilt\nangle reaches 60 or above \(see Figure 4  between object detections\n\(cars and pedestrians hypothesis for low tilt angle\nviews.\nIn [8], the vertical vanishing point is computed us-\ning a RANdom SAmple Consensus \(RANSAC discovered vertical directions are then\nused to detect the head and foot points in each blob to com-\npute the horizontal plane by a least mean square regression.\nThe focal length is determine using hypothesis testing based\non the known human heights distribution.\nTo our knowledge nobody has ever tried to learn the\nviewing angle using the shape of people’s silhouettes. The\nclosest related idea was found in [12], where the authors\nproposed to retrieve the camera angle using the ratio be-\ntween the width and height of the pedestrian bounding box.\nHowever they did not use it in their ?nal results.\nUsing people as measurement devices is not likely to\nwork for a single person on a single frame but accumula-\ntion of clues from different people over time can give good\napproximations.\n5.3. Setup\nFor our proof of concept the silhouette dataset was split\ninto two disjoint parts. The training set is composed of 42\npedestrians \(Ids 0-13, 25-38 and 50-63 to 14\navatars \(0-13 Ids 14-24 and 39-49 different avatars\n\(14-24 designed with video surveillance ap-\nFigure 6.

Distribution of ?y angles in the train and test sets.\nplications in mind, we therefore assume that the camera\nlooks down on the scene, i.e. the world projection of the\ncamera principal point is located under the horizon \(so that\nthe camera center axis intersect the ground plane compute their representation feature\nvector and the relative view angle at which they are seen in\nthe scene see Figure 6 pixel\nof the pedestrian bounding box is used as a reference to\ndetermine ?y . The distribution of these angles in the train\nand test sets are given in Figure 7.\nIn the online part the input is a non-empty sequence\nof frames. For all the silhouettes in the sequence above a\nthreshold area, feature vectors are computed. The view an-\ngle associated to the nearest neighbor in the feature space is\nretrieved. From this points two approaches are considered:\n1. Simply averaging the angle returned by the matching\nprocess \(we eliminate outliers using the 3-sigma rule to compute a regression\nof the view angle plane. Here a simple least square re-\ngression is performed. The angle for the center pixel of\nthe camera is returned as the view angle for the frame.\n70915\nRandom View Extracted Training Extracted Test view\nFigure 5.

Simple descriptors for shape matching.\nThe second approach requires all pedestrians to navigate on\nthe same horizontal plane and assume the arctangent func-\ntion in the ?y computation can be approximated by a linear\nfunction. This is true when the focal length is larger than\nhalf the sensor height. For example with a 35mm focal and\na 36mm sensor, the function varies between arctan\(?0.51 0.51 straight line. Results are\ngiven for all scenes with view angles between 10 and 80\ndegrees vertical angle for 100 frames \(200 to 300 are very coarse,\nthe bounding box of the pedestrian silhouette is simply re-\nsized to ?t a 16x32 \(feature 1 or a 8x16 \(feature 2 retrieving the ?rst nearest neighbor in the fea-\nture space \(see Figure 8 investigate\nhow the results vary depending on several parameters of the\nsystem.\n5.4. Results\nFor the toy problem presented here only synthetic video\nsequences have been considered. In order to test this idea\non real data we would need both camera calibration ground-\ntruth and dense segmentation ground-truth on the same se-\nquences.\nPrediction-combination strategies In Figure 9, we show\nthe angle estimation errors obtained with our two ap-\nproaches. A surprising fact is that even by simply averaging\nthe angle estimation for each pedestrian in the scene we ob-\n 0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n 10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80\nE\nst\nim\nat\nio\nn nE\nrr\nor\n \(d\neg\nre\nes\n degrees 16x32 Approach - 1 frame \(16x32 16x32  8x16 under 10 degrees for low angles view and under 4\ndegrees for high tilt views. Please note that this is achieved\nby looking at a single frame only. Using a plane regres-\nsion to retrieve the camera tilt angle seems bene?cial for all\nangle views, lowering the error to under 7 degrees for low\nangle view and under 3 degrees for high tilt angles.\nThe difference of accuracy between low and high angle\nviews seems to come from the shape matching approach.\nIn Figure 10, we show the number of test silhouettes per\nframe. It can be seen that the total number of silhouettes is\nsmaller for lower angles. Indeed, people in the foreground\nsometimes completely occlude people in the background.\nFor the same reason the number of non-occluded masks is\nvery low. Our shape matching mechanism does not know\nwhether a shape is occluded or not, it just ?nds the closest\nlooking shape seen in training. We think that developing an\nocclusion-aware shape comparison system might reduced\nthe performance gap between low and high angle views.\nNumber of frames per prediction In Figure 9, we also\ncompare the mean error according to the number of frames\n7106\n 0\n 5\n 10\n 15\n 20\n 10  20  30  40  50  60  70 80\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf S\nilh\nou\net\nte\ns \npe\nr F\nra\nm\ne\nCamera Tilt Angle ? \(degrees number per frame.

Henceforth candle-sticks rep-\nresent the min/Q1/med/Q3/max values, a yellow cross, the mean.\nused for the angle estimation. As expected using more\nframes lowers the mean error but also reduces the devia-\ntion and worse case errors \(maximum angle converge to zero when\nthe number of frames increases, as seen in Figure 11. These\nsystematic errors toward which they converge seem to be\nsmall, but stable. The fact the error is constant for a given\nview angle is very interesting. We have not found any valid\nexplanations for such behavior yet. It might be due to the\nfact we use the bottom of the bounding box to compute the\nangle ?y . This approximation has more impact on lower\nangle views.\nIn Figure 12 we show some visualization results obtained\nwith our technique and a known focal length. The camera\nangle is used to create a virtual ground plane below the fore-\nground silhouettes The quality of the ground reconstruc-\ntion and variation over frames are better seen in video See\nsupplemental material - http://clementcreusot.\ncom/pedestrian interesting\ntheoretical question about pedestrian shape, this work can-\nnot yet be used on real life sequences as the people seg-\nmentation it requires is very dif?cult to obtain with current\nvision systems.\n6 Discussion\nIn the ?eld of segmentation, prior data is rarely consid-\nered. Most segmentation techniques are heuristic in nature\nor rely on very local learning \(for example pixel color dis-\ntributions objects being often suf?cient\nto recognize objects/postures, one might consider using sil-\nhouettes to help segmentation using machine learning tech-\nniques. This is our main focus for future work using this\ndataset.\nWe can imagine numerous other applications for which\nthis data can be used. For example it might be possible\nto retrieve a person’s orientation from its silhouette which\nmight be of interest in terms of attention detection, urban\nplaning, and advertisement study. Detecting if a silhouette\nis occluded or not can also be done by using two-fold classi-\n?cation methods. If a statistical model is constructed from\nthe 


database it is in theory possible to reconstruct an esti-\nmate of the occluded part of a pedestrian. This can be very\nuseful in highly crowded scenes where the level of occlu-\nsion is important.\nWhile our ground-truth dataset of silhouettes can still be\nimproved in terms of variability \(limited number of avatars,\ngait situations, lack of accessories and non-human occlu-\nsions acquired\npedestrian video segmentation. The strong point of our\ndataset is that it is temporally dense, pixel accurate, that\nit presents a variability large enough to generalized to pre-\nviously unseen people, and offers a large amount of human-\nto-human occlusions.\nReferences\n[1] P.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

I will show recent examples of the use of nonlinear control theory for the assimilation and con-\ntrol of single neuron and network dynamics, a control framework for Parkinson’s disease, and the potential \nfor unification in control of spreading depression and seizures. Lastly, I will discuss why the subtle and \ndeep intersection of symmetry, in brains and models, is important to take into account in this transdisci-\nplinary fusion of computational models of the computational brain with real time control.  \n Biographical Sketch: Steven J.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
