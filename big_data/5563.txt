Data Stream Clustering Algorithm Based On Active Grid Density  Jing Yang, Wenxin Zhu, Jianpei Zhang, Yue Yang College of Computer Science and Technology Harbin Engineering University Harbin 150001, China  yangjing@hrbeu.edu.cn  zhuwenxin_210@yahoo.cn   Abstract  CluStream is a representative data stream cluster algorithm; however, it is not able to find arbitrary clusters in shape and deal with boundary points effectively. A new algorithm which is based on active grid density AGD-Stream is proposed to solve these problems in this paper. The algorithm adopts a density decaying technology to capture the dynamic of data stream, and extracts the boundary point of grid to delete Besides, this paper uses activity concept to judge activity of the 
grid density, neglecting the inactive grid density and preserving the active gird density for clustering. Experiment shows that AGD-Stream can not only find arbitrary clusters in shape, but also deal with boundary points. Compared with CluStream, AGD-Stream is better in time complexity and accuracy Keywords data mining; positive and negative association rules; dual confidence; minimum correlation I  I NTRODUCTION  With the development of information technology people's lives are flooded with more and more data in the form of streams every day. As the data streams have the characteristics of continuity, potentially infinite, high mobility etc  making the data stream mining algorithm can only be examined in sequence, one pass or a limited 
time  So, the traditional mining methods are difficult to meet its need in the limited time. In the recent study, the data stream clustering algorithm has been attracting the attention of many domestic and foreign researchers proposing a lot of algorithms. Initially, L.O ‘Callaghan   et al proposed several clustering algorithms of data stream which can not express the dynamic for data stream. In 2003 a popular data stream clustering algorithm CluStream  was proposed by Aggarwal. The algorithm uses a two-tier online/offline framework for data streams clustering According to the pyramid time frame structure to store the summary statistics of micro-cluster for the macro cluster The drawback of CluStream is: It can only recognize the spherical clusters, but not reveal clusters of arbitrary shapes 
it can not handle the boundary points, and clustering accuracy is low Recently, some other algorithms such as ACluStream   DenStream  D-Stream  and the RTCS  are supposed These algorithms can identify th e arbitrary clusters in shape however, the time complexities of clustering are a little high, leading to the low efficiency of these algorithms besides, some effective data points were recorded as a boundary point in error and delete in the process of clustering. So, these algorithms can neither deal with the problem of boundary points better, nor solve the shortage of CluStream effectively In order to solve above problems, a new algorithm for clustering stream data is proposed,\(Data stream clustering algorithm based on active grid density, AGD-Stream 
 it can not only find clusters of arbitrary shapes, but also deal with the problem of boundary points effectively. First, the data space grid is divided into a grid structure which is formed by a number of small cube grids, then the data stream is mapped to this structure, applying the concept of density to form the concept of grid density. And, the algorithm adopts a density decaying technology to capture the dynamic of data stream, and extracts the boundary point of grid to delete. To use concept of activity to judge active of the grid density, neglecting the inactive grid density and preserving the active gird density for clustering. Experiment shows that AGD-Stream is better than CluStream in time complexity and accuracy II   B ASIC DEFINITIONS  
In this paper, we need to do the following work for the demand of grid division: Assume that the input data has n dimensions, and each input data record is defined in the space R  12 n R RR R  000  where i R is the definition space for the ith dimension. Now, we partition the n  dimensional space R into certain spatial grids. Suppose for each dimension, its i th dimension space i R  i 1, 2, 3… n is divided into i r  partitions 1 2   
i ii i ir R RR R 002\002 000  Then the grid made up by data space R is partitioned into 1 n i i Nr   003  grids. For a arbitrary density grid g that is composed of 12 1 2  n j jnj R RR  000  i j 1 i r e denote it as g  j 1 j 2 j n being a data record   1  n Xx x

Moreover, the previous data in grid can not affect the following clustering, so we can record its grid density as 0; Relatively, if the data always arrive at a grid, then this grid has higher grid activity. In the process of clustering data streams, the grid density of a grid with high activity is called the active grid density. In order to meet the characteristics of the data stream and save memory space, we only need a higher activity grid to process clustering Definition 2.4 \(Dense grid and sparse grid\et m C be the threshold for dense grid l C be the threshold of sparse grid l t be the last data received 1   nm D gt C 010 then we call it a dense grid 2   nl D gt C 011 and l n t t  then we call it a sparse grid 3   lnm CDgt C 011\011 then we call it a transitional grid To some grid, if the data does not arrive at a grid for a long time, leading to the number of data in the grid is very small, the impact of the history data on data clustering is negligible, we call such grid a sparse grid. Relatively if the data in the grid grows to a certain quantity, we call the grid a dense grid. A dense grid may degenerate to a transitional or sparse grid if it does not receive new data for a long time On the other hand, a sparse grid can upgrade to a transitional or dense grid after it receives some new data records   By definition 2.4, the density of the grid will change over time. Therefore, after a period of time, the density of

The tested set is a real data set used by the KDD CUP-99. It contains network intrusion detection stream data collected by the MIT Lincoln laboratory. This data set contains a total of five clusters and each connection record contains 42 attributes.

It can be seen from Figure 2, with the increasing length of the data stream, both of the algorithms have a linear increasing trend. But the time CluStream spent is much more than the AGD-Stream spent significantly and CluStream takes three to four times more clustering time than AGD-Stream takes. For example, when the length is 15, both the algorithms corresponding time points approach to 2s, 6s, respectively. This shows that the time complexity of AGD-Stream on clustering is significantly lower than CluStream, which also reflects that the AGD-Stream has more efficient B  Clustering Accuracy Analysis AGD-Stream still use KDDCUP99 data sets to compare its accuracy with CluStream. The data sets are divided into three classes: len=0.02, len=0.04, len=0.05.The results are shown in Figure 3-1, 3-2 In Figure 3, len indicates the size of each partitioned segment in the normalized dimensions. For example, when len = 0.02, there are 50 segments in each dimension. Both the Figures show that the average clustering accuracy of AGD-Stream is higher than CluStream’s, and the highest percent of  AGD-Stream is 99%;while CluStream’s is 98.7%.When len=0.02,the average accuracy of AGDStream is 98%,higher than 97.6% of CluStream and when len=0.05  the clustering accuracy of AGD-Stream is 0.2 higher than CluStream Besides, we can see that: Neither dividing grid more fine ,more better, nor too tough. If some grid is divided too fine, it is much easier to part the data in the same cluster into other clusters, resulting in lower clustering accuracy. While, if it is too tough, it will lead some   Figure 3-1  Clustering accuracy of CluStream    Figure 3-2 Clustering accuracy of AGD-Stream data in different clusters into same cluster, and it also results in lower clustering accuracy V  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, a new algorithm based on active grid density for clustering stream data was proposed. The data space grid is divided into a grid structure which formed of a number of small cube grid, then the data stream is mapped to this structure .And this algorithm adopts a density decaying technology to capture the dynamic of data stream then extracts the boundary point of grid to delete it. Besides this paper uses the concept of activity to find active grid density, and clustering at last. The algorithm can not only find clusters of arbitrary shapes, but also deal with the problem of boundary points effectively. The algorithm also references gap interval as the time period, reducing the amount of computation. Experiment shows that AGDStream algorithm, compared with CluStream, has lower time complexity and better clustering accuracy A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 61073043 61073041; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China under grant number HEUCF100602 Harbin Special Funds for Technological Innovation Research under grant number 2010RFXXG002 and the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province under grant number F200901 R EFERENCES  1  J.
