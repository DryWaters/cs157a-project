Average Number of Frequent Closed Patterns in Bernouilli and Markovian Databases Lo ck L HOTE Franc ois R IOULT ArnaudS OULET GREYC CNRS UMR 6072 Universit e de Caen Basse-Normandie F-14032 Caen cedex France  forename.surname  info.unicaen.fr Abstract In data mining enumerate the frequent or the closed patterns is often the rst difìcult task leading to the association rules discovery The number of these patterns represents a great interest The lower bound is known to be constant 
whereas the upper bound is exponential but both situations correspond to pathological cases For the rst time we give an average analysis of the number of frequent or closed patterns Average analysis is often closer to real situations and gives more information about the role of the parameters In this paper two probabilistic models are studied a B ERNOULLI and a M ARKOVIAN  In both models and for large databases we prove that the number of frequent patterns for a xed frequency threshold  is exponential in 
the number of items and polynomial in the number of transactions On the other hand for a proportional frequency threshold  the number of frequent patterns is polynomial in the number of items and does not involve the number of transactions Finally we prove in the B ERNOULLI model that the number of closed patterns for a proportional frequency threshold is polynomial in the number of items 1 Introduction The aim of the data mining i s to extract relevant information from large databases These databases gather 
transactions  which are sets of items  for example a list of purchase in a shop or a set of biomedical characteristics In association rules discovery the sets of items which are frequently present play a central role These frequent patterns can tell that a conjunction of items are often present together in the transactions They allow to build association rules which are at the core of numerous data processes but the difìculty of the task is known to lie in the frequent patterns mining The motivation of our article is to make clearer this difìculty When the complexity of a pattern mining algo 
rithm is studied it most of the time focuses on the worst cases or on the bottleneck of speciìc sub-tasks such as database accesses For example in A-PRIORI 2 the rs t and most popular algorithm there will be as much database scans as the size of the largest frequent pattern Facing to large databases this is an important point More precisely G UNOPULOS et al have shown that mining the frequent patterns with such level-wise algorithms requires as many database accesses as there are elements in the positive and negative borders 5  i  e t h e number of maxi mal frequent and minimal infrequent patterns  It follows that the com 
plexity of A-PRIORI intuitively lies in the quantity of frequent patterns The number of database accesses does not address the real difìculty of pattern mining and T OIVO NEN gives in 12 a p r o b a b ilistic m e th o d b a sed o n sam p lin g  which nds all the probably frequent patterns with only one database access In order to improve the efìciency of pattern mining closed patterns are very interesting A closed pattern is the maximal pattern w.r.t the inclusion of the set of patterns having the same frequency and being present in the same 
transactions When they are associated with the corresponding pattern of transactions both constitute a concept  Conceptual learning is a hot topic 13 and cl os ed pat t e rns are an easy way to non redundant association rules 14 Their mining has then been widely examined 7 Gunopulos et al have shown that deciding whether there exists a frequent pattern with t items is NP-complete 6 10 The associate counting problem is P-hard When all the items belong to all the transactions each pattern is frequent pattern so that in the worst case the number of frequent patterns is of order O 2 m   On the other hand if each trans 
action is empty all the patterns are infrequent and the number of frequent patterns is of constant order There is a large gap between the worst and the best cases and both situations are pathological examples In practice the real order is not known Regarding the complexity average analysis is an interesting point of view for three reasons First of all each Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDMê05 1550-4786/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


database is associated to a probability so that the analysis considers the diversity of cases Then if the model is close to the reality this analysis gives a realistic average behaviour of the studied parameter which is sometimes far from the worst case Finally if the concentration property around the average is satisìed fast counting algorithm are available On the other hand real life is often complex and the modelization is not an easy task Furthermore the more complex is the modelization the more difìcult is the average analysis We found one such study 10 b u t i t i s rel at ed t o t h e failure rate of A-PRIORI It is useful for predicting the number of candidates that the algorithm will have to check This work conìrms the results of 4 whi ch us ed an upper bound On the other hand the authors of the A-PRIORI algorithm have explained in 1 t hat there are v ery fe w long patterns in a random database In a previous work we used the same probabilistic model and recall here our results We also improve them with studying a M ARKOVIAN model In this article we propose for the rst time an average analysis of the number of frequent and closed patterns for two probabilistic models of databases In the worst cases the results are well mastered there is an exponential number of frequent patterns according to the number of items On the contrary we provide an average analysis of the number of frequent patterns with two probabilistic models the rst is the simple B ERNOULLI  where each transaction contains an item with a uniform probability p  the second is a M ARKOVIAN model which better reîects the correlation of the real data because each transaction is generated by aM ARKOVIAN source Indeed this model considers local correlations between close items but the transactions stay independent two by two Both models are rather simple and not close to the reality however they point very interesting phenomena In particular we show that the number of frequent patterns with a proportional minimum frequency threshold is surprisingly polynomial in the number of items and does not involve the number of transactions 2 Database modelization 2.1 Deìnitions and notations The set of items is noted I   1 m  and has the cardinality m whereas the set of transactions is noted T   t 1 t n  and has the cardinality n  By deìnition each transaction t i is a subset of I and a database B is a couple  I  T   The database B admits a matrix representation  where  is a boolean matrix whose coefìcients  i,j  i  1 n  j 1 m satisfy  i,j 1 if and only if j  t i  We will not discuss here about the methods for obtaining such a boolean matrix starting from continuous or multi-valued items see 11 for an e xampl e The support of a pattern A I is the set of all transactions containing A andthe frequency of A is the size of its support Deìnition 1 frequent pattern Let B be a binary database with m items and n transactions and  a strictly positive integer smaller than n  A pattern A is said  frequent if  support  A     We now give in this framework the deìnition of a  closed pattern Deìnition 2 frequent closed pattern Let B  I  T  be a binary database with m items and n transactions and  a strictly positive integer smaller than n Fixalso  the matricial representation of B  A pattern A is  closed if A is a  frequent pattern for all item j in I A  there exists a transaction t i in support  A  such that j does not belong to t i  i.e  i,j 0  2.2 First hypothesis Hypothesis on the sizes biological databases have many items and few transactions leading to fat databases which are wider than high It was observed that the number of frequent or closed patterns have a completely different behaviours than in large databases which are higher than wide It is then normal to consider this phenomenon In this article we deal with large databases where the number of items is at most polynomial in the number of transactions and vice versa The mathematical version of this property is  H 1 og m  c log n c  0  Recall that m resp n  is the number of items resp transactions We will see that this property plays an important role in our results Hypothesis on the frequency threshold a pattern is said frequent as soon as its frequency rises over a user deìned threshold  For  1  experiments lead to an exponential number of frequent/closed patterns whereas for   n  it is constant and often equal to zero Hence according to the frequency threshold we may expect different results Two kinds of thresholds are considered in this article xed threshold  is xed and does neither depend on n nor m  It corresponds in practice to a very small threshold compared to the number n of transactions  10 for instance proportional threshold there exists r  0  1 such that   r  n  In this case the threshold is a non-negligible proportion of all the transactions  10 for instance Remark that with the proportional threshold the number of unfrequent patterns is much more important than with the xed threshold leading to a complete different behavior see next section Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDMê05 1550-4786/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


2.3 B ERNOULLI model We now describe the simple B ERNOULLI model Since we can not appreciate in advance the correlations existing in a databases we rst suppose that Model 1  B ERNOULLI model The database   i,j  i 1 n,j 1 m forms an independent family of random variables which follows the same B ERNOULLI law of parameter p in 0  1  This model is far from the reality Indeed an equivalent in Information Theory is to modelize the French language with a memoryless source that respects the probability of each letter The result is not very realistic but theoretical analysis can yet be lead 2.4 M ARKOVIAN model In the second model each transaction is a sequence of m random variables with values in  0  1  that follows a M ARKOVIAN process of order k  In other words an item belongs to a transaction according to a law that only involves the values of the k previous items The M ARKOVIAN model of order k  is completely described by the way the rst k items are affected and the transition probabilities  p w  x  w,x  x  0  1  w  0  1  k  where p w  x is the probability that the new item takes the value x knowing that the k previous items form the word w  We suppose that the initial values of the rst k variables are given by the distribution f init  f w  w  0  1  k  We now precisely describe the second model Model 2  M ARKOVIAN model Fix k  1  f init   f w  w  0  1  k an initial distribution on  0  1  k and  p w  x  w  0  1  k x  0  1  the transition probabilities Then each transaction is computed independently from the other transactions according to the following method for a transaction t   1  m     1  k  is computed according to the initial distribution f init  Then the values of  k 1  m are sequentially evaluated using the k previous values and the transition probabilities Contrary to the B ERNOULLI model the M ARKOVIAN model introduces local correlations between items This is of course insufìcient for modeling real databases but it constitutes an improvement compare to the rst model M ARKOVIAN databases may have a sense if an organisation of the items entails that close items are much more correlated than distant items In bioinformatics the items are the genes and it is known that close genes are much more correlated than distant genes 3 Theoretical results This section enumerates three new theorems about the average number of frequent or closed patterns in a random database Results in the B ERNOULLI model always involve explicit constants On the other hand results with the M ARKOVIAN model express with theoretical constants related to the transition matrix The proofs can be found in 9 Theorem 1 Fixed threshold Fix a threshold  and suppose that the hypothesis H 1 is fulìlled Then the average number of frequent patterns F m,n in a B ERNOULLI database of parameter p or in a M ARKOVIAN database with matrix transition P is polynomial in the number of transactions and exponential in the number of items F m,n  c 0 n     m  1  In the B ERNOULLI model  1 p  and c 0 1 In the M ARKOVIAN model  is the dominant eigenvalue of a strictly positive matrix and c 0 is related to dominant spectral objects This average result is standard with the intuition given by the worst case according to the number of items there is an exponential quantity of frequent patterns This phenomena is well known and the difìculty of pattern mining lies in the size of the item set I  This theorem also shows that the number of frequent patterns polynomially depends on the number of transactions This is coherent with the complexity of A-PRIORI regarding the number of database scans equal to the maximum pattern length The results with a proportional frequency threshold are more surprising Theorem 2 Proportional threshold Fix r  0  1 and suppose that the hypothesis H 1 is fulìlled Finally suppose that the frequency threshold satisìes   r  n  Then the average number of frequent patterns F m,n in a B ERNOULLI database of parameter p or in a M ARKOVIAN database with matrix transition P is at most polynomial in the number in the number of items with an upper bound that does not involve the number of transactions F m,n  c 1 m s  In the B ERNOULLI model it is an equivalence as soon as r is not a power of p Then c 1 1 s  and s   log r log p   Theorem 2 is an unexpected result Indeed experiments usually highlight a very important number of frequent patterns even with such a proportional threshold It is nevertheless not sufìcient to conclude that this quantity is exponential When the threshold  varies from 1 to n  the number of frequent patterns goes from an exponential behaviour Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDMê05 1550-4786/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


to a constant one Theorem 2 suggests that a proportional threshold is sufìcient to get a polynomial behaviour We nish this section with a theorem concerning the closed patterns in the B ERNOULLI model Theorem 3 Closed patterns Fo r  1    log m  log p  the number of closed patterns C m,n and frequent patterns are equivalent C m,n  F m,n  With the uncorrelated model of B ERNOULLI  the number of frequent and closed patterns coincides In real databases closed patterns are yet well known to be very few than frequent patterns and allow to design very efìcient mining algorithms because they synthesise the correlations in the data Mining the closed pattern is more complicated than for the frequent patterns and it is not justiìed for the uncorrelated databases Corollary 1 With a proportional threshold   r  n the average number of closed patterns C m,n is polynomial in the number of items C m,n  m s s  where s   log r log p   For a large enough frequency threshold   the number of frequent patterns is almost equal to the number of closed patterns Experiments with classical synthetic databases T10I4D100K and T40I10D100K conìrm the theoretical result 8 s ince s ynthetic data are almos t without cor relations On the other hand the theorem does not reîect the real behaviour of Pumsb another database concerning fault diagnosis problem of electro-mechanical devices because this dataset does not follow our uncorrelated model and the same remark applies with the database Connect  4Conclusion In this article we have given three new results about the average number of frequent and closed patterns in random databases It is the rst time that such analysis is performed Two probabilistic models were studied a B ERNOULLI model that generates uncorrelated databases and a M ARKO VIAN model where close items are correlated These models are far from real life but give new fruitful information for the pattern mining In particular we proved that for a xed frequency threshold the number of frequent patterns is polynomial in the number of transactions and exponential in the number of items On the other hand if the frequency threshold is proportional to the number of transactions the average number of frequent patterns admits a polynomial behaviour with respect to the number of items This last result is unexpected for specialists that commonly refer to the worst case and its exponential growth The average number of frequent patterns is quite interesting to evaluate the complexity of A-PRIORI In order to be complete we also need to evaluate the size of the negative border and it is a work in progress In the same eld we are also interested in many other open problems such as the number of closed patterns for a xed threshold and for other probabilistic models the average size of the positive border the average size of the largest frequent which corresponds to the number of steps for A-PRIORI etc References 1 R  A gr a w al  H  M anni l

This is due to  the fact that the number of rules corresponding to two consecutive guesses of minimum supports lie outside of the desired range. One is smaller than Nmi, and the other is greater than Nmm. To resolve this problem, step size must be refined in fixed step approach. However, no such problem occurs for the proposed Secant-based approach 5 Conclusion Adaptive-support association rules are constrained association rules with application to collaborative recommendation systems. In this work, we have proposed an eficient data-mining algorithm for the discovery of adaptive-support association rules. Simulation results have demonstrated that its performance is more efficient than the fixed step size approach adopted in [7]. However our implementations d o  not generate frequent itemsets and association rules simultaneously as in [7].

reader's convenience. In actual cases the top ranked terms are selected as topic descriptors 3.3 Extracting Highly Informative Terms In our third experiment we began with just a simple question or a phrase. This phrase was fed into the Google search engine. The query results were analyzed by the AR algorithm, and the highest ranked terms were collected for further use. We then used the highest ranked terms to expand the original query and refine the search. The following table holds the query phrases, the AR algorithm highest ranked terms, the revised search phrase and it's first retrieved web page Table 5.  Using the AR Algorithm to Extract Highly Informative Terms \(The extracted terms are used for query expansion Original Query Phrase AR Highest Ranked Phrases Revised Query Phrase Topic of the First Retrieved Page  Sleep and appet-ite depressed mood anxiety disorder Sleep and appetite Depressed mood anxiety disorder Informatio nal Reports on Depression and Stress What is the origin of the human race racial evolution ancient scientific What is the origin of the human race racial evolution ancient scientific The Races of Humanity What is the furthest star in the solar system orbiting asteroid gravitational pluto What is the furthest star in the solar system orbiting asteroid gravitational Pluto HubbleSite All FAQs for Solar System Hitchc-ock movies marnie lodger vertigo psycho Hitchcock movies marnie lodger vertigo psycho Auteur theory of Alfred Hitchcock Once again the AR algorithm extracted terms that served as descriptors and could be used for farther query expansion. We chose to expand the query phrase by simply adding the first four terms extracted by the AR algorithm A different approach would have been to give the user the list of extracted terms. The user would then be able to select from the list the most suitable terms to be added to the original query phrase Note that the question "what is the furthest star in the solar system?" was not stated properly, since the users meant to find the furthest Planet and not Star. The AR algorithm was able to find the term, "Pluto" \(the fourth of the ranked terms\ despite this "mistake". Furthermore, very common terms such as "who", "what", "is" are ignored by the Google search engine. Thus, for example, the query what is the furthest star in the solar system", translated to only four terms "furthest, star, solar, and system 3.4 Discussion This chapter presented three different approaches for validation of the AR algorithm. First - the "Free Associations Turing Test" confronts the question whether the AR algorithm can "imitate" human associations. The second - analyzing proxy logs deals with the question whether the AR algorithm can extract human-interest topics from the user's surfing history. And finally, the third part deals with the question whether the AR algorithm can help the user to better express his thoughts and reach valuable information more efficiently While the answer to the first question is based on a solid statistical base \(we compared ten association rules measures, 100 seed terms, 70 different questionnaires and 900 people who answered the different questionnaires\e latter two were based on much smaller samples. Thus the conclusions were qualitative rather than quantitative. Still we believe that the potential for creating a user profile or using the AR algorithm to extract highly informative phrases has been shown 4 Concluding Remarks The AR algorithm that extracts highly informative phrases was shown capable of both "imitating" humans by creating human-like associations and giving highly informative descriptors of Internet pages. The extracted descriptors were used to reveal the user current interest topics and to supply query expansion terms. The algorithm complexity is low, and can be performed in near real-time The success of the algorithm raises the question whether actual human thinking processes are performed similarly The algorithm is rather robust and can be employed for various usages, or to even use other asymmetrical association measures as links between concepts. One of the most promising usages we forecast for this algorithm is user conceptual modeling and prediction. By using the AR algorithm to extract concepts and associations from the pages the user visits, an analysis of "flow" in a conceptual graph can show trends and determine the probability for the user to reach certain concepts within his current surfing session. In future work we intend to identify common properties for similar users, and define a profiling technique based on the random walk algorithm Many other interesting challenges are still waiting to be addressed in the web search algorithms area. For a good review of the most promising is the partitioning of the web by eigenvectors s   5 References   A  Fara h a t, T  L o Faro, an d J  C  Miller Modification of kleinberg's hits algorithm using matrix exponentiation and web log records Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval SIGIR 2001 New Orleans, USA, September 2001   A  A  Freita s O n r u le i n ter estingn es s m eas u r es   Knowledge-Based Systems 12, 2000, pp. 309-315 Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDMê05 1550-4786/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

9 Here are some observations and explanations on the results 1\The total time of our comparison includes the time to write the association rules to a file; Bit-AssocRule is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the various Apriori algorithms \(64-221 times faster\he test data set, the big the time difference between the BitAssocRule and the various Apriori algorithms. We havenêt compared our algorithm with some of the other association rule algorithms such as VIPER  13,24] \(CHARM and CL OSE are base d on the closed frequent itemsets concept\d on their published comparison results with Apriori, our BitAssocRule is very competitive compared to them and a direct comparison will be conducted and reported in the near future 2\e or litter longer time than the various Apriori algorithms in constructing the 1-itemsets because of the extra cost of building the bitmaps for the 1-itemsets. But after the 1-itsemtset is done, Bit-AssocRule is significant faster than the Apriori algorithms in constructing large frequent itemsets because it only uses the fast bit operations \(AND COUNT and SHIFT\nd doesnêt need to test the subsets of the newly candidate 3\aps of the frequent items, and the bitmap storage \(uncompressed less than the original data set \(1/2 to 1/4 of the original data size The main reasons that Bit-AssocRule algorithm is significant faster than Apriori and its variations are 1\ocRule adopts the divide-and-conquer strategy, the transaction is decompose into vertical bitmap format and leads to focused search of smaller domain There is no repeated scan of entire database in BitAssocRule 2\snêt follow the traditional candidate-generate-and test approach, thus saves significant amount of time to test the candidates 3\basic operations are bit Count and bit And operations, which are extremely faster than the pattern search and matching operations used in Apriori and its variations 5. Conclusion The contributions of this paper are in two aspects:  we extend the application domains of bitmap techniques and introduce the bitmap techniques for complex DSS query optimization and association algorithm. We present a bitmap based query optimization algorithm to optimize complex query with multiple table join based on outer join operations and push the outer join operations from the data flow level to the bitmap level and achieve significant performance gain.   We introduce a novel algorithm to calculate the foundset for those tables involved in the prejoin table by using prejoin_bitmap_indexes and integrate this algorithm into the current commercial data flow based query engine seamlessly. Our query optimization can achieve an order of magnitude faster than conventional query engine Secondly we introduce the bitmap technique to the data mining procedure and develop a bitmap-based algorithm Bit-AssocRule to find association rules. Our BitAssocRule avoids the time-consuming table scan to find and prune the itemsets, all the operations of finding large itemsets from the datasets are the fast bit operations. The experimental result of our Bit-AssocRule algorithm with Apriori and AprioirHybrid algorithms shows Bit-AssocRule is2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster. This research indicates that bitmap technique can greatly enhance the performance for decision support queries and finding association rule, and bitmap techniques are very promising for the decision support query optimization and DM applications Bitmap technique is only one way to improve the performance of complex DSS queries and DM algorithm Parallelism is another crucial factor to improve the performance of DSS and data mining.  We are currently working on paralleling the bitmap-based algorithms and hope to report our findings in the near future 6. References  Agrawal R.

Related work The most similar to the representations based on generalized disjunctive sets is the NDR representation which consists of all frequent non-derivable itemsets [7 8], and the representations based on ?-free sets [7, 9]. It was shown in [8], that for each non-empty itemset Z, one can derive the lower bound \(l\(Z u\(Z on sup\(Z from the fact that sup\(Z Non-derivable itemsets are those for which u\(Z Z gt; 0. If u\(Z Z sup\(Z supersets Y of a derivable itemset are also derivable and u\(Y Y Y such that neither sup\(Z Z Z Z It was proved in [7, 8] that u\(Z Z  u\(Z?{a Z?{a for |Z| ? 1 This important result was used in [7, 8] to determine the upper bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets namely: non-derivable itemsets are not longer than log2|D|? + 1 Hence, the bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets is identical to the bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free sets \(please see Theorem 3.2 It has been proved in [7] that ?-free sets are a subset of non-derivable itemsets, so their length is also bounded by ?log2|D|? + 1 There is a claim in [7, 9] that the generalized disjunction-free sets equal the ?-free sets. This claim however, is not correct, which we will prove by the example beneath. Table 4 contains all generalized disjunction-free sets. Among them, there is {fh}, the support of which equals 0. The support bounds for {fh are found as follows \(please, see [7] for the details  sup\({fh f h   sup\({fh f  sup\({fh h  sup\({fh Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Hence, l\({fh fh fh sup\({fh free, is not a ?-free set Since the families of the generalized disjunction-free sets and ?-free sets may differ, finding the relationship between them or between the generalized disjunction-free sets and non-derivable itemsets remains a challenge 8. Conclusions The representations based on generalized disjunctionfree sets belong to the most concise ones among all lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In 


lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
