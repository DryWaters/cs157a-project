systems, and the intermediate frames in the same frame-group was b i-directionally predicted by the first-frame and the endframe with homography transformation. The homography matrix was got approximately by the airborne inertial navigation systems firstly and then was accurately computed by fast multiple sub-areas template matching. At the end the first frame and the residual images of the intermediate frames of the same frame-group was merged into a big image and coded by JPEG2000 to generate fixed-size code streams. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm was with high compression performance, low computational complexity and excellent capacity for code-size control and will has good prospect in engineer Keywords-unmanned aerial vehicle; image compression; homography transformation;JPEG2000; H.264; low complexity I  I NTRODUCTION  Unmanned aerial vehicle \(UAV\ has wide applications in military and civilian affairs. It usually carries a variety of imaging devices for investigation and can acquire a large amount of image data. Limited by the communication 
bandwidth, an image compression algorithm with high fidelity, high image compression ratio, and fixed compression ratio must be used to reduce the code-bit rate In view of the payload limitation of UAV in terms of volume, weight and power consumption, this image compression algorithm is also required to have low computation complexity[1 2 Fo r UA V   th e cam era  i s  mounted on a high-flying motion platform to capture the ground scene, so the image sequence obtained in this way has significantly different temporal and spatial characteristics from common images or video sequences. Therefore, the commonly used compression algorithms, such as jpeg200 and H.264, which are optimized for still images or motion videos, \(like digital camera, digital video, film or TV\ are no longer applicable for the compression of images acquired by UAV[3  4   In th is p a pe r an im ag e s e qu en ce c o m p res s i on  algorithm based on homography transformation for UAV was proposed. This algorithm blended the advantages of JPEG 2000 and H.264, and highlighted the advantages of 
low complexity, high compression ratio, fixed code bandwidth and strong anti-noise capability II  T HE FEATURES OF IMAGE SEQUENCE  Assume the flying height of UAV was h, flying velocity was v, the field of view \(FOV\ in heading direction was 001  the frame frequency was f. Then the geometrical relation between adjacent frames was shown in Fig.1. Substituting commonly used flight parameters of UAV into the figure 1 it could be found that there was about 80%-95% overlap which suggested high redundancy in sequence images       
 2 002 2 002  Figure 1  The geometrical relation between adjacent frames In the images obtained by a high-flying UAV, there were some separated moving objects \(cars, pedestrians, etc\, but they were so small and slow in proportion to the whole image that they could only bring negligible variation to the overlap area between the adjacent frames. Thus, the variation between adjacent frames was mainly caused by the changes of camera’s position and attitude due to the movements of UAV, and the imaging process between the adjacent frames of high-flying UAV could be approximately viewed as a homography transformation induced by a plane [6

According to above analysis, there was a large overlap between the adjacent frames got by UAV and these overlapped areas had a strong global temporal relativity. For a group of images acquired within a short time-slice, the temporal relativity among these images could be effectively eliminated by global motion estimation and compensation The process could be described by a homography transformation. In this way, an image compression algorithm with high compression ratio and low computation complexity could be achieved, which was based on global homograph motion compensation and frame-group coding III  T HE G EOMETRIC M ODEL FOR I MAGING  For a high-flying UAV, each frame could be approximately viewed as the projection of a target scene plane  003 on the image plane of airborne camera. The correlation between point X in the scene and its corresponding image point m could be expressed as m  HX 1 Where H was the homography matrix from 003 to m and the rank was 3 As mentioned above, the overlap region of two adjacent images could be viewed as photographing the same region by two cameras from two positions at the same time. Let X  be a point in the target scene, the image captured by the two cameras be m and m and the homography matrixes between 003 and two image planes be H 1 002 H 2 then we got m  H 1 X 002 m 000  H 2 X  Obviously 003 didn 000 t pass the optical center of two cameras and H1 002 H2  were full-rank matrixes. Therefore, a two-dimensional transformation also existed between m and m 000 which made the following formula hold m 000 Hm 2 where 1 21 H HH   With the matrix H we could achieve the pixel registration and compensation in the overlap area Assume that the intrinsic parameters matrix of camera was K and the position and attitude of the second camera to the first one was R 002 t Let the coordinate of the first camera be world coordinate, then the imaging matrixes of the two cameras could be respectively denoted as P=K\(I|0\,P 000 K\(R,t  Take a point in 002 randomly X  X 000\004 1 T and saw its projection on two cameras. It was obvious that the projection of X on the first camera was 1 X mp KX  000§\000 000¨\000 000©\000 000\004 000\004 3 Therefore, the homography matrix of 002 to the first image plane was H 1  K  The projection of point X on the second camera was     11 XX mP KRt KRXt   000§\000 000§\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000 000©\000 000\004\000\004 000\004 4 If n was the normal vector of 002 in the coordinate defined by the first camera d was the distance from the origin of coordinate to 002 then the equation of 002 was n T X 000\004 d 002 i.e n d T X 000\004 1 002 among which n d  n/d Hence t=tn d T X 000\004  Thus it could be derived that the projection of point X on the second camera was    T d mKRXtKRtnX  000\004\000\004 5 The homography matrix from 002 to the second image plane was H 2  K\(R+tn d T  and then the homography matrix between two images could be expressed as [7  11 21  T d H HH K R tn K   6 Where K was the intrinsic parameter matrix of the camera, which could be obtained by the camera calibration R and t denoted the rotation matrix and translation vector of m to m which could be easily got by by the inertial navigation system \(INS\of UAV. and the detailed computing process is presented in the next part IV  I MAGING COMPRESSION METHOD  According to the aforementioned characteristics of the image sequence acquired by UAV, a novel high-performance image-sequence compression algorithm was proposed in this section. The flowchart of the algorithm was shown in Fig.3   Figure 2  the image sequences compressing flowchart For UAV, the following parameters could be provided by INS and the other airborne electronic systems : flying height h FOV a x 000h a y   frame frequency f and the instantaneous velocity in heading direction v i These parameters could help to determine whether there image frames overlap, and if they do, the overlapping frames would be bound into one framegroup. In each frame-group, the intermediate frames F c could be bi-directionally predicted by the first-frame and the endframe. The prediction matrix had been given in equation \(4 and \(9 As shown in Fig. 1, we assumed that the first-frame F s was captured at point m and the end-frame F c was captured at point m With the information got by the airborne INS and the imaging parameters of the camera, the position and attitude information of airborne cameras could be obtained which can be signed as   xm ym zm xm ym zm XXX 004\004\004 and    xm ym zm xm ym zm XXX 004\004\004 respectively. Then the rotation matrix R from m to m’ for the camera could be expressed by the following equation cos cos cos cos sin sin sin sin sin cos sin cos cos sin cos cos sin sin sin sin cos cos sin sin sin sin cos cos cos R 005\006 002 006 002 005\006 002 006 002 005\006 005\006 002 006 002 005\006 002 006 002 005\006 005\002\005 002\005      000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000  7 Where  001  002\025  002\026  002 xm  002 xm 002 002 ym  002 ym 002 002 zm  002 zm  002  The displacement vector from m to m was C  X xm X xm 002 X ym X ym 002 X zm X zm  T 002 8 For equation \(9

t RC 9 Using equation \(6\\(9\ and the data from INS, the initial predicted matrix from first-frame to current frame H sc0 and the initial predicted matrix from end-frame to current frame H ec0 could be easily derived. Then the predicted position in the first-frame and end-frame of the sub-blocks in the current frame image could also be obtained Considering the possible errors caused by INS the distortion  caused by topographic of landform, and the other unexpected issues, a fast multi-sub-region template matching algorithm should be used to get accurate homography matrix H, after the acquisition of initially H sc0 and H ec0 The flowchart for the image matching was shown in Fig.3  Figure 3  The flowchart of fast multiple sub-areas template image matching method Since H has 8 degrees of freedom, at least 4 accurately matched point-pairs must be acquired to solve the equation sets. Taking into account both computation reliability and computation complexity, 9 evenly distributed sub blocks were selected to implement fast template matching to get the initial point-pairs. Then through hypothesis-testing approach false matching points were eliminated, leaving 4 point-pairs with minimum residual errors to exactly compute H The value of H was got by sloving linear equation groups defined by the matched point-pairs.With H, the overlap area in the current frame could be accurately predicted by equation \(2\ Then the overlap area of the inter-frames in one group could be precisely compensated by the reference frame \(first-frame and end-frame\. Since the predicted result was very close to the inter-frame, the residual error would be very small. In this way, a high compression ratio could be achie  9   To achieve high compression ratio and accurate bandwidth control, the first frame and the residual images of the inter-frames in the same frame-group were merged into a big image and coded by JPEG2000. The PCRD-OPT algorithm was used for global optimal code-bit truncation which could reduce the distortion to minimum and realize a global optimal code bit distribution. A typical merged image was shown in Fig 6. Finally, the information about the code stream of JPEG 2000, the predicted matrix H, and framegroups were packed and produced the ultimate code stream  Figure 4  the merger of frame-groups When decoding, the merged image was restored with JPEG 2000 firstly, and then the first-frame could be extracted from the big image according to the frame-group information. The first-frame of the next frame-group was also restored to serve as the end-frame of current framegroup. Finally, all images in the group could be restored with H sc0  H ec0 and the restored residual frames V  E XPERIMENT AND A NALYSIS  In this section, the performance of the proposed algorithm \(UAV Codec\ was tested. Image sequences captured under different flight states of UAV were used for test. H.264 and JPEG2000 were used for comparison. For H.264, the famous reference model software JM10  was adopted with following parameters: one I frame for per 15 frames; the search range for motion estimation was 16 the max number of reference images was 5; and the motion estimation algorithm adopted was Simplified Hexagon Search. For JPEG2000, KaKadu 6.0 [1 a s ad op t e d w i t h  following parameters: the transformation kernel was 9-7 wavelet; the wavelet order was 5; the size of coding block was 64 000h 64; and the output order was LRCP A  The visual quality of the decompression images Several groups of  simulate images got by UAV were put to test and each group consisted of 25 frames. The size of the images was 1024 000h\000\024\000\023\000\025\000\027\000\021\000\003 The frame frequency was 25 fps Experiment results were shown in Fig.5 and Tab. 1   Figure 5  The comparison of images restored by UAVcodec 002 JPEG2000 and H.264  with  compression ratio 200:1  A comparison of images restored by the three algorithms at 200:1 was provided in Fig. 5. The statistics of PSNR under different flight states and with different compression ratio was presented in Table 1. From Fig. 5 and Tab. 1, it could be found that in all cases, the dynamic video compression methods, represented by UAVcodec and H.264, had clearly superior performance to the still compression methods represented by JEPG 2000. With the increase of compression ratio, this superiority became more and more notable. The difference between the images restored by the three algorithms could be easily seen out in the images in Fig. 7. In Tab. 1, the PSNR of UAVcodec and H.264 was higher than that of JPEG2000 by 6-10dB It could also be found that though the PSNR of the proposed algorithm was approximately equal to that of H.264, UAV Codec could reserve more detailed visual information. This merit was mainly brought by the global code-bit distribution strategy and the global multi-subregions template matching algorithms. The advantage could be easily revealed by the visual quality of restored images Look at the first and the second row in Fig.5 and you may find that some marginal and structural details which appear

quite blurred in the images restored by H.264 could be well reserved in images restored by the proposed algorithm TABLE I   T HE A VERAGE P SNR OF T HE T HREE A LGORITHMS  Compre ssion ratio Tested algorith m Horizontal advance Vertical ascent Horizo ntal turning Rolling   64:1 UAV codec 36.895 39.616 32.787 29.463 H.264 36.341 38.609 32.875 29.701 JPEG 2000 26.222 25.062 25.254 21.754   200:1 UAV codec 29.985 31.893 28.797 24.882 H.264 26.911 27.071 25.059 22.572 JPEG 2000 19.624 18.779 19.144 18.713 Moreover, since H.264 algorithm could merely control the compression ratio by adjusting the quantization step within each frame, it was unavoidable that with high compression ratio, its output code-bit size and SNR would fluctuate dramatically, making it unable to fully make use of the communications bandwidth and even causing the loss of code stream. On the contrary, the proposed algorithm, which realized an accurate compression ratio control by coding with frame-groups and PCRD-OPT, could accurately implement compression ratio controlling and take full advantage of channel bandwidth, enabling it to exhibit much more reliable performance B  The image compression speed In this part, the compression speed of the three algorithms was tested. The test environment was like this CPU P4 2.8G, memory 1024M 002 operating system Windows XP. The proposed algorithm was programmed in VC 6.0 with standard C language. The software for comparison and the image sequences for test were the same as those in Section 4.1. The average time for compressing 25 frames was given in Table 2 TABLE II  C OMPUTIONAL T IME OF T HE T HREE A LOGORITHMS  Compression Ratio  Time spent compressing 25 frames\(s  16:1 64:1 200:1 JPEG2000 0.72 0.44 0.40 H.264 276.00 271.60 259.04 UAVcodec 1.34 1.08 1.02 It could be found in Table 2 that the average time taken by the proposed algorithm was only a little longer than that of JPEG 2000, while much less than H.264. The reason for this was that the motion prediction of the proposed algorithm was much more effective than H.264, partly because that only 9 sub blocks were involved in the computation of the homogrphy matrix for motion prediction, the computational cost of which was far below the complicated motion estimation algorithm adopted by H.264, and partly because that the data of airborne navigation system was employed to estimate the initial value of homography matrix and predict the initial position of matching blocks, which reduced the size of searching window for image matching and thus enhanced the searching efficiency To sum up, based on the characteristics of the image sequence of UAV, with a computational cost similar to still image compression algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves a compression performance as good as that of the famous dynamic video compression algorithm H.264. All these combine to prove that the proposed algorithm can be well applied to the image compressing for UAV VI  C ONCLUSION  AND D ISCUSSION  The special imaging process and application environment determined that the commonly used image or video compression algorithms fall short of the image compression requirements of UAV. Focusing on this issue, the paper proposed a novel high-efficiency image-sequence compression algorithm based on homography transformation Experiment results shown that the proposed algorithm well adapted to the motion and imaging characteristics of highflying UAV and blends the advantages of JPEG 2000 and H.264.

much as desired, it is not easy to control how information is disseminated once it is out on Internet. It is possible however to imagine that by a combination of logs and techniques such as watermarking, the dissemination of information can be \(at least partially\ontrolled and that in case of a privacy breach, it is possible to find which persons are potentially suspect because they have previously accessed this information Report spam/abuse The possibility of reporting bad behaviour or abuse of other users within the SNS makes it possible to detect users that divert it from its original goal for instance by spamming other users for financial or malicious purposes Reputation system If the SNS manages some kind of reputation mechanism, it becomes more difficult for a newcomer within the SNS to perform privacy breaches without his reputation being affected. For instance, Orkut allows users to “rate” their friends but this feature is only for fun without any real impact on friend reputation V  P RIVACY ENHANCED S OCIAL N ETWORKING S ITE  A  Definition A Privacy-enhanced Social Networking Site \(PSNS\can be defined as a SNS that fulfils the following properties Privacy awareness and customization A PSNS makes the user aware of some of the potential risks of sharing information with other persons. In addition, it also gives an easy and flexible way for to the user to express his privacy concern in terms of a personal policy and to compare it with the privacy policies of other actors such as the SNS applications or other users Data minimization The user can check which of his information is accessed by SNS services \(SNS provider and third party application\ and how this information is used. In particular, the SNS services have to state clearly which personal information of the user they need and how they will process it. The user can then make an enlightened decision on whether or not to accept the SNS services. The PSNS should have an in-built mechanism to control access to the information of the user and ensure that all SNS services cannot access more data than authorized Data sovereignty It should be state explicitly in the privacy policy of the SNS that the personal data of the user belongs to him and not to the SNS that stores it. For instance the SNS should not use the personal data of the user without its explicit consent and should not be able to sell it to other entities. Moreover, if the user decides to quit the SNS, this one should explicitly delete all the information stored regarding the user \(and not even keep a copy for the uncertain case where the user might want to come back later\. The user should also have the possibility to track how his information is disseminated \(for instance which friends have seen which pictures\ also to control information related to him that have been posted by other users \(such as tag on a picture that points to his profile B  Related Work To the best of our knowledge, there are only two proposals of systems that try to integrate privacy tightly into the design of the SNS: HelloW n d t h e Pr i v ac y  Preserving SNS of Cutillo, Molva, and Strufe [26  T h es e  two systems are based on the concept of decentralization and peer-to-peer techniques. As a result, these systems suffer from the common disadvantages of decentralized system redundant resources and no centralized control \(which in terms of privacy can of course be seen also as an advantage With these two systems, it becomes more difficult to search for friends and relatives. Moreover, the techniques proposed are intensive and suitable only for advanced users. Casual and normal users may possibly prefer a balance between privacy and ease of use. This is one of the motivation  behind Privacy Watch, our own privacy-enhanced SNS C  Privacy Framework for SNS Privacy Watch is based on the Privacy Framework for SNS that we have proposed in a previous work [2  In particular, we have defined four privacy levels No Privacy Soft Privacy, Hard Privacy, Full Privacy\d introduced the concept of User Privacy Policy UPP\This framework provides users with an easy and flexible way to specify and communicate their privacy concerns to other users, third parties and SNS service provider. In our system, the user can choose to which extend he trust the SNS provider. In particular based on his privacy level, the user will determine how much information he would like to share with the provider. For example, in the situation where the user chooses Full Privacy, the SNS server is only trusted in storing an encrypted version of the personal information of the user so that it can consult at any time by one of his friends but not to the point where the SNS itself has access to this information \(as the SNS server does not know the keys needed to decrypt this information\. As the purpose of Privacy Watch is to protect the user privacy, the privacy level is set by default to Full Privacy \(see Table 1 TABLE I  D EFAULT P RIVACY S ETTINGS IN P RIVACY W ATCH   No Privacy Soft Privacy Hard Privacy Full Privacy \(default Default Privacy Settings Healthy Harmless Harmful Poisonous Default Friend groups Best friend Normal friend Acquaintance Visitor Trust in SNS Provider Best friend Do not encrypt data Normal friend Encrypt Poisonous data Acquaintance Encrypt Harmful and Poisonous data Visitor Encrypt all data before uploading Access control Server side Server side Client side Client side

 D  Privacy Watch Figure 1 presents the overview of Privacy Watch Contrary to HelloWorld, Privacy Watch is based on the traditional client-server paradigm where a central system \(the SNS server\ is being responsible for storing the personal information of the user \(but possibly encrypted\. The users of Privacy Watch have a Client Privacy Manager \(CPM\ that resided on their computer \(for instance as a Firefox or Safari plug-in\hich has the responsibility of helping them to maintain their data sovereignty of their personal information Privacy Watch also relies on an auxiliary third party such as independent mail server to store and exchange privacy policies and encryption keys with the contacts and friends of a user. This is a form of protection of privacy through the splitting of information between two entities \(the SNS server and the email provider\, it is therefore very important that these two entities are really independent and non-colluding 1  Architecture The architecture of Privacy Watch is composed of the following components  SNS Server Database This module stores the encrypted data sent by the CPM, normal data \(unencrypted\as well as user privacy preferences \(such as possibly the UPP of the user and his groups of friends  SNS Services This module includes all social services provided by the SNS such as Friends, Blog, Profile, RSS Tagging, Photo or Music  Server Access Controller The purpose of this module is to control all data access according to the UPP of the user and to manage possible UPP violations. It also manages the access control mechanisms to the personal information of the user for his friends. Therefore in a sense it acts as a proxy sitting between the personal information of the user and his friends Mail Server This module is a third party email server such as Hotmail and Gmail that is assumed to be independent from the SNS. It is used to store and exchange keys \(for instance encryption/decryption keys\ well as UPP between users \(in case where the user does not trust the SNS for doing so  Privacy Advisor This module recommends suitable privacy level adapted to users. The privacy level of a particular user is elicited by a question-response protocol between Privacy Advisor and the user that is both easy to understand and flexible. The Privacy Advisor also helps to warn users about potential risks in SNS as well as guides them to create their UPP. Another function of this module is give recommendation on new possible friends based on their reputation in the system  Encryption/ Decryption As its name implies, this module is used to encrypt and decrypt data of users if necessary  Client Access Controller When the user does not trust the SNS, this module will take the roles of Server Access Controller, monitoring access to user encrypted data  Key Manager This module is responsible for creating keys used for encryption/ decryption, as well as managing the group signature scheme used to control the access to his profile on the SNS server In Privacy Watch, we separate the encryption of the data, which is done using a symmetric cipher with a cipher key, and the access control mechanism to the profile of the user which is based on a group signature scheme \(members of different groups of friends of a user have different group key    Figure 1  Overview of Privacy Watch 
177 


For each of his group of friends, a user generates a public\ verification key that will be transmitted to the SNS server whereas the private signature keys will be transmitted by email to the members of the group \(one different for each friend of the group\ A friend of the user can used his private signature key to sign messages \(such as random messages on behalf of the group but without having to reveal his exact identity, thus proving to the SNS server his membership. The SNS server can then use the verification key of the group to check the validity of the signature. As some group signature schemes include the possibility of revoking locally a particular private signature key, the user still has the possibility of removing a particular friend of a group by revoking his key in cooperation with the SNS server 2  Scenario When Alice registers to the SNS, she downloads and installs her Client Privacy Manager CPM as a browser plug-in. Based on the recommendation of the Privacy Advisor Alice chooses her level of Privacy Full, Hard, Soft or No Privacy\ and specifies her UPP For example, as Alice is “privacy-addicted” she chooses Full Privacy  The Key Manager in the CPM creates an account for Alice on the Mail Server that will be used for key sharing. It then creates different keys \(K PS or encrypting many attributes of her profile as well as verification/private signature keys for each group of Friends. For each attribute Name, Birth day, Address, Photo album...\n her profile Alice states the privacy settings of the attribute \(Poisonous default, Harmful, Harmless, Healthy\ using the Interface  module. For example, if a photo album is considered to be  harmless the Encryption/Decryption Module uses the K PS_Harmless to encrypt it and then sends it to the SNS Alice can now use the SNS to connect with friends and choose to befriend Bob. The Privacy Advisor proposes to Alice four possible Friend Groups Best friend, Normal friend, Casual friend, Visitor: default\ For example, Alice classifies Bob as Normal friend The Client Access Controller in Privacy Watch knows the UPP that Alice has specified for this particular friend group and emails this UPP to Bob. In order to befriend Alice, Bob has to accept this UPP. Bob’s Access Controller now stores Alice’s UPP Key Manager uses email to send Bob his private signature key  K Normal_friend,Bob as well as all K PS of the attributes that he is allowed to see as a normal friend of Alice Every time Bob logins to the SNS through his CPM his Key Manager automatically checks his email account in order to update keys to the key database. According to the Full Privacy, normal friend can only see harmless data Based on the rules defined in Access Controller and Key Manager the Interface module only displays harmless data to Bob. Afterwards, Bob clicks on Alice’s photo album A 1  The CPM of Bob uses the key K normal_friend,Bob in order to prove to the SNS server that he belongs to the group Normal Friends of Alice \(by signing a random challenge in behalf of the group\. Bob can then download A 1encrypted the encrypted version of Alice’s pictures\ and then the Encryption Decryption Module will use the appropriate K PS_Harmless to decrypt the pictures and the Interface module will display them to Bob. All this procedure is performed by the CPM of Bob which is directly integrated as a plug-in in his browser VI  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we have first discussed the different privacy issues raised by the current SNS as well the privacy risks that a user incurs while putting personal information on these SNS. These three main privacy risks are Security  Credibility  and Reputation and finally Profiling While SNS and privacy may seem a priori to have two opposite goals we think that the fact that most of the current SNS does not respect the data minimization and the data sovereignty principles is not a fundamental impossibility result, but rather a design choice made by the SNS providers. Therefore in order to reconcile them, we have identified the different features that an SNS can integrate into its design to enhance the privacy of its users and we have introduced the concept of a Privacy-enhanced Social Networking Site \(PSNS A PSNS is a social networking site that fulfils the properties of privacy awareness and customization, data minimization and data sovereignty. We have also described Privacy Watch, our proposed implementation for a PSNS Regarding the privacy criteria that we have defined in Section IV, Privacy Watch currently fullfills most of them except a few that we plan to implement as future works such as the report spam/abuse mechanism and the reputation system The most difficult part remains how to enforce in practice the privacy policies stated by the different actors of the SNS such as SNS provider, applications and other users\.  Indeed it is very easy for an actor to state a particular privacy policy but in reality nothing really forces him to respect it once he has been able to access this information. For instance, a friend might do a copy of a particular sensitive picture of the user without his consent. However, by combining watermarking methods with logs for access control, it is possible to design a system that can partially monitor the dissemination of information regarding the user. Moreover we are also currently studying how to use cryptographic techniques in order to implement a mechanism where in the case of the disclose of unauthorized information, the data owner will be able to prove to a third party \(such as a legal authority\ that is privacy has been damaged by another party For instance, a friend might do a copy of a particular sensitive picture of the user without his consent.

  9 degrees/second were typically used.  These rates exceed those corresponding to access li nk conditions, but smooth lower rate slews are difficult to generate using the commercial gimbals in the prototype link  In the case of the prototype LT, the LT gimbal and the LT acquisition camera were mounted side-by-side on an aluminum plate which was then mounted on the lower gimbal.  See Figure 7\(a\est configuration is shown in Figure 8\(a  During link demonstration tests at JPL, acquisition, pointing control, and optical data transmission were demonstrated Pointing acquisition was accomp lished by first manually aiming the prototype orbiter transceiver at the prototype LT to simulate the latter\222s illumination by blind pointing of the former.  The remainder of the acquisition process was automated: the OT\222s beam wa s easily detected by the LT\222s acquisition camera, and the LT then locked onto the OT\222s beam, and illuminated the OT, which then also locked onto the beam it received.  Figure 12 shows azimuth \(a\and elevation \(b\motion of the LT gimbal, as it moves to track out simulated orbiter transceiver motion, introduced by the lower gimbal on which the LT gimbal and acquisition camera are mounted.  Figure 12\(c\he simulated motion of the orbiter transceiver as seen by the LT  WFOV camera  Figure 13 shows the tracking errors recorded in the LT, with 1\b errors of 125 265 rad and 118 265 rad in the x \(azimuth y \(elevation\degrees of freedom, respectively. Figure 14 shows similar performance histograms for the OT, showing somewhat better performance than in the lander transceiver Pointing performance at both ends was sufficiently good to achieve reliable communication with 1 mrad beams although the beams used in the demonstration had widths of 2 mrad.  In particular, these pointing errors would result in pointing loss less than the 3.5 dB allocation 99 % of the time in the transmission from the OT to the LT, and 96.5 of the time in the reverse transmission; consequently pointing errors would result in only a slight reduction in link capacity  During the link demonstration tests we demonstrated data transmission in all of the supported data transfer modes 200 Mb/s\m the LT to the OT, and low-rate PRBS \(50 Kb/s from the OT to the LT   Figure 12  a\ Azimuth axis motion of LT gimbal \(b Elevation axis motion of LT gimbal \(c\ Centroid of OT beacon moving on the WFOV camera    a Angular-travel of base Acquisition Angular-travel of base Acquisition  b Angular-travel of base Acquisition Angular-travel of base Acquisition  c Wide-Angle Camera Record of OT laser spot motion Stray points were random noise prior to acquisition Wide-Angle Camera Record of OT laser spot motion Stray points were random noise prior to acquisition 


  10  Figure 13:  Prototype lander transceiver tracking errors 7  C ONCLUSION  An optical access link would be id eally suited to the task of returning high-rate digital data containing high-resolution images from the surface of Mars to a relay satellite in orbit around Mars.  In such an access link, the range is sufficiently small that only moderately high precision pointing is needed, so that the pointing control systems could be made relatively simple, light, and inexpensive.  We have constructed a prototype of such a system, which uses only a motorized gimbal for pointing control in the lander transceiver, and a motorized gi mbal together with a fine steering mirror in the orbiter transceiver.  Using these prototypes, we have demonstrated sub-milliradian pointing performance, and the transmi ssion of digitized streaming video at a data rate of 270 Mb/s.  Key ongoing developments include making the initial blind-pointing more reliable and building a larger entrance aperture diameter WFOV camera.  We also plan to identify space qualified parts that could be used in future transceiver designs     Figure 14  Prototype orbiter transceiver pointing errors   A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration The authors gratefully acknowledge contributions by Kevin Birnbaum, Jeffrey Charles, Carlos Esproles, Malcolm Wright, Vachik Garkanian, and David Zhu towa rd development and testing of components and support during link emulations  R EFERENCES   C.

The distance of the reflected beam from the center of the aperture is then used to calculate I  which varies from about -0.8\260 to +0.8\260 in the experiment Figures 24-28 show the change r I    found by taking the difference of the center of each spectral image and subtracting from its location when I and compared the modeled values over the same range of I Figure 23 illustrates that there is some amount of random error in these measurements, but overa ll the data is grouped around r 0 pixel difference between the measured and modeled values.  The 404.7nm source shows the most variation  Figure 23 \226 The difference in pixel displacement at the detector array between measurements from modeled and collected data as a function of I     Figure 24 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 404.7nm spectral line   Figure 25 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 435.8nm spectral line   Figure 26 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 546nm spectral line   Figure 27 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 577.5nm spectral line   Figure 28 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 635nm spectral line   Given that the model is able to predict the displacement of energy as a result of an error in p   due to incident angle data was collected similar to that with the tilted camera to examine the effect system atic error due to unknown I  caused by a misaligned prism Here, the prism was angled in the mount in two directions to create the angles x and y  between the prism face and the normal to the optical axis as shown in Fig. 10.  The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
