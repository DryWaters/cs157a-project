and worst case under different parameter MinSup The axes and curves have the same meaning as described above. If we set Z\006\007  1 we can detect 90% of total faults by examining only 16 event handlers out of the total 176 event handlers in the best case, but in the worst case, we have to examine 89 event handlers to detect the same percentage of faults. Table IV shows the same meaning statistics as Table III but to TerpSpreadSheet From this table we can come to a conclusion that to TerpSpreadSheet our method performs very well in both the best case and worst case except that Z\006\007$%& equals to 1 Attention should be paid that although we may have to check same number of event handler to detect 90% of total faults both in the best case and worst case under some parameter MinSup but the two figures clearly indicate that we have to check fewer event handlers to detect a lower percentage of total faults in the best case. We should also not neglect that besides MinSup  equals to 1, the other 7 curves overlap each other highly both in the best case and worst case  Figure 5.

Table V shows the same meaning statistics as Table III but to TerpWord  Judging from this table, we can conclude that to TerpWord  our method performs very well in both the best case and worst case except that MinSup equals to 1, 7 or 8.Simliarly although we may have to check roughly same number of event handler to detect 90% of total faults both in the best case and worst case under some parameter MinSup on the whole, our method performs better in the best case. Also besides MinSup equals to 1 or 8, the other 6 curves coincide with each other highly both in the best case and worst case TABLE IV.

TABLE V. N UMBER OF EV ENT H ANDLER EX AMINED TO REVEAL 90 OF THE 224 FAULT VERSIONS OF T ERP W ORD  Case  Z\006\007  1 2  3  4  5  6  7 8 Best  7 40  40  40  42  41  57  57 Wo r st  150  40  40  40  43  42  617  617   4  TerpPresent Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 respectively show the result of our method on TerpPresent in the best case and worst case under different parameter MinSup If we set MinSup 1, we can detect 90% of total faults by examining only 2 event handlers \(these two event handlers contain most of the faults for TerpPresent in the best case, but in the worst case, we have to examine 34 event handlers to detect the same percentage of faults. Judging from Table VI, we can reach a decision that to TerpPresent our method performs very well in both the best case and worst case except that MinSup equals to 1 or 8. Equally, we should take care that the other 6 curves overlap each other highly besides MinSup equals to 1 or 2 in the best case, meanwhile another 5 curves coincide with each other highly besides MinSup  equals to 1, 2 or 8 in the worst case From the above results we can say that our proposed method performs well for GUI software. After applying N gram analysis to the event sequences of all test cases, we can rank the event whose corresponding event handler contains faults high. Making use of the result, programmer can check a few event handlers to detect a majority of the total faults At present we have no common rule for the value selection of MinSup but we can observe from this result that if we give MinSup a too low value, then we may take into consideration some irrelevant N grams, in this condition we will get a pretty good result in the best case yet a relatively poor result in the worst case. On the contrary, if the value of MinSup is too high, some very important N grams will be abandoned by us, this will cause our fault localization technique to lose efficacy. Considering all these factors, we can give MinSup a median value when putting our method into practice, in such a case, we can expect to get a good result both in the best case and worst case. Our preliminary result indicates 3 is a candidate value for MinSup  TABLE VI.

The results of the study, presented above, should be interpreted keeping in mind the following threats to validity  Figure 9. Data from TerpPresent best case   Figure 10. Data from TerpPresent worst case  First of all, although we can sort the events in order of probability of their corresponding event handler containing the fault successfully using N gram analysis, but to certain event of GUI software, the eventês event handler contains much source code and consequently there exists many faults in the event handler. Until now we can only identify this kind of event handler has high level of suspicion but can not identify which specific part of it is doubtful. Maybe we can combine with various traditional software fault localization techniques to further analyze this kind of event handler Another important threat to validity concerns the complexity of a few event handlers. Some event handlers may contain nested function call. Although when establishing the one-to-one relationship between event handler and fault, we take one thing with another to the best of our ability, but owing to the complication of GUI software we canêt guarantee the fullness between event handler and fault, i.e., there may exist few event handlers that also contain certain fault but the relationship is neglected by us this also can to some degree affect the accuracy of our result But the relationship between event handler and fault we use in our study exists in no doubt, if we can find the complete 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 0 20 40 60 80 100 Number of faulty versions of event handler that need to be examined MS-1 MS-2 MS-3 MS-4 MS-5 MS-6 MS-7 MS-8 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 0 20 40 60 80 100 Number of faulty versions of event handler that need to be examined MS-1 MS-2 MS-3 MS-4 MS-5 MS-6 MS-7 MS-8

relationship between event handler and fault, we can anticipate a better numeral result As described above, our downloaded test cases are generated according to GUIês graph model EIG and are used for smoke testing, so the length of each test case is limited For one thing, our method makes use of the information of the whole test case suite, the experimental results may not be valid under random smaller test case suite, i.e., they may not be statistically repeatable. Moreover, restricted by the limited length of each test case, we canêt systemically observe the effect of C DEF by giving it a variation range although we have full reason a choice of 3 for it should be reasonable  V  R ELATED W ORKS  In this section, we briefly review previous work related to GUI software fault localization To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on GUI software fault localization. However, many fault localization techniques based on the contrast between failing and passing cases run-time information has been applied to conventional software. In [1   2   the autho r s  make use of various heuristics and apply them to program traces to rank statements in order of their relative suspiciousness.

Especially in 4  the m e tho d  N gram analysis is used to analyze the exact execution sequence of the program to rank the executable statements of software by level of suspicion Our proposed GUI software fault localization technique based on some important achievements in GUI testing several researchers and practitioners have discussed the following concepts and definitions that are relevant to its specific parts.

In [6  the autho r s  give a relatively formal definition of event handler   VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORKS  This paper presents a GUI software fault localization technique by analyzing the event sequences of faulty versions to sort the events in order of probability of their corresponding event handler containing the fault. Our proposed technique has been evaluated with respect to four subject programs under different parameters and results clearly demonstrate its effectiveness if we take appropriate parameter GUI software fault localization is a totally new research issue, how to carry out effective fault localization in connection with GUI softwareês characteristic is a challenging problem. This research has presented several exciting opportunities for future work. To begin with, we can combine GUI software fault localization with traditional software fault localization, we can first successfully sort the event using our proposed method, then regarding the event whose corresponding event handler has much source code we can use traditional software fault localization technique to further analyze the event handler to get a more detailed result Moreover, a process of using certain random strategy to select some test cases from the whole test case suite and then applying our method on the relatively smaller test case suite can be implemented, the mean result of this repetitive process can be used to more comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of our proposed method. We are also working on applying our proposed technique on GUI applications with different kinds of characteristics to further demonstrate its effectiveness and commonality, such as programs with complex underlying business logic and a fairly simple GUI even other event-driven software \(EDS\, including Web applications, device drivers and embedded software  R EFERENCES  1  J.

   V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS The performance of the proposed approach in terms of various parameters is discussed in this section A.  Data Set We have evaluated the performance of proposed algorithms by using the synthetic data set for different users to calculate the weight of each web page. Consider the structure of a web site consisting of four web pages namely A, B, C and D and their respective interconnection shown by direct edges as shown below in Figure 1       Figure 1: Web Site Structure The following factors are considered for performance evaluation Outbound links which shows the out degree of nodes for the graph of Figure1 Page Rank \(PR which can be calculated on the basis of the equation \(3 Number of visit shows the visiting frequency of each web page by user, it can be decided on the basis data received from web log Page Size defines the size of page on the basis of information content of the web page, which can be measured in bytes Time spent describes the resumption of a particular web page by user in seconds  The above parameters used in proposed experimental set up for the Web Path Traversal, by considering the graph mentioned in Figure1 B. Evaluation Method The attributes considering for the training data set for each user of a web site is represented in terms of time spent on each page and frequency. From these data sets we are 


calculating the weight for each web page for respective web site. The proposed approach uses Visiting Frequency and Time Spent on a Web page as two parameters to measure the weight of each web page To estimate the performance of the proposed two algorithms i.e. FPW and FTPW, discussed in section IV based on the above parameters involved in estimation C. Experimental Results The performance of the proposed approach can be evaluated by comparing the performance of FPW and FTPW algorithms which differ in number of parameters considered for experimentation. The comparison is made by taking the attribute like Visiting Frequency in FPW, and further Visiting Frequency and Time spent on a web page are clubbed together in FTPW as another attribute. The experimental setup uses five users and weights are plotted against various parameters Figure 2 shows the plot of Visiting Frequency v/s Weight of a web page              Figure 2: Plot between frequency and weight Algorithm: FTPW Input: Web traversal path database Output: Weight for each page 1 Calculate PageRank for each page \(PRi 3 2 Initially Set W\(Pi 3 Check the user is registered or not, if YES then 4       whether the user is first time visitor, if YES then 5  return W\(Pi 6    else 7      calculate FW\(Pi 4

CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK 


 Web Usage Mining have been used in improving Web site design and marketing decision support, user profiling, and Web server system performance. Web page prediction technique is a very important role in web technologies. This paper proposes efficient algorithms for web path recommendation based on Weighted Association Rule. Two factors frequency and time spent were used to decide the web path traversal. The experimental results show that in the proposed approach when we increase the number of parameters for finding the web path the accuracy of the system is enhanced drastically and FTPW produces more accurate results than those achieved by FPW In the future, we shall improve the Web Path Traversal by considering the parameter Data Transfer Rate to provide the accurate Web Path traversal REFERENCES 1] M.
