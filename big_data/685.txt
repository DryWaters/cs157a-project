Store SVG Document in ORDBMS  Jinfeng Gao GuiZhou University GuiYang City, China gaojinfeng0213@163.com Xiaorong Chen GuiZhou University GuiYang City, China xrchengz@163.com   Abstract Because of big SVG document storing spatial data in WebGis, The searching by attribute is low efficiency and need the high quality hardware in the client. In order to solve the two problems, by making use of the rules mapping DTD of SVG document to relation schema extended for being fitted for SVG document, we complete storing SVG document in Objectrelational database. Finally, we realized management of the spatial data by tag document to by Objected Relational database and achieved the expected results Keywords SVG; Algorithm; Schema mapping; DTD; DTD Graph; Object-relational  database I   I NTRODUCTION  SVG\(Scalable Vector Graphic\built upon XML and used for publishing graph and image in Web Was recommended by W3C\(World Wide Web Consortium\ in September 2001, and was expected to meet the need of web-developer that drawing the graph and painting the image is dynamic, scalable and platform irrelevant. Applying SVG in WebGIS[1  n o w  WebGIS based on SVG document storing graph and image data have realized navigation 002 panning, layer control and searching by attribute in electronic map[2  B e c a u s e s p a t ial  data applied in GIS often are big data set, even some are magnanimous[3 i n t h e pro c e ss o f  p ubl i s hi ng geo g rap hy information by SVG document we find the storing spatial data SVG document is very large and the large document result in low efficiency of search by attribute and the need of high quality hardware in client. Considering the progress of ORDBMS in data management in recent years, In order to solve above problem, we proposed storing SVG document in ORDBMS and realize management of spatial data by SVG document to by ORDBMS[4  According to the above problem and considering the progress of management for spatial data of the ORDBMS, such as POSTGI a nd O r a c l e 9i   w e  e x t e n d t h e a l gor i t hm  o f  mapping the XML document DTD to OR schema, store SVG document in ORDBMS, and succeed in realizing the transformation from the management of spatial data by SVG document to by ORDBMS. So, the method not only can reduce the space, but also can improve the efficiency of managing spatial data II  RELATED  WORK Considering SVG is based on XML, some approaches or technologies of storing XML in ORDBMS proposed and discussed in recent years can be utilized when addressing storing SVG documents in ORDBMS Object-Relational database management System ORDBMS\ products have all the advantages of RDBMS furthermore, it has more expressive type system than RDBMS and supply a number of functions of processing the spatial data The high performance of ORDBMS in spatial data management supply the security of successful solving the problem resulting from large SVG document and is the main impetus we storing the SVG document in ORDBMS Alexander Adam[6 st ed  b u i l d i ng a SV G  p l at for m  used for processing the data retrieving from database. In this method of publishing GIS information, the cost of constructing platform is too high Ref[7  p r o p o s e d c o n s tru c tin g a s p a tia l d a t a b a se  p l a t f o rm  storing the SVG document. This approach also need build a new platform and can’t make full use of the development of ORDBMS, so, still have a lot of drawbacks To sum up, it is feasible to solve the problem resulted from large SVG document by storing the SVG document in ORDBMS. Of course, we should emphasize the SVG document in this paper is used for storing spatial data rather than the general graph and image data III  THE  FEATURE  AND  OGANIZATION  OF  SPATIAL  DATA Because the SVG document in this paper is used for storing spatial data and the data structure of spatial data is complex, we should know how to classify, describe and organize the geographic objects. In general, according to its geometry, the geographic objects are divided into five categories point  line  polygon  annotation and raster 8  T h e or ga ni z a t i o n o f spa t i a l  data is same type of entity tiered In order to illustrate the organizational and expressive model of spatial GIS data in SVG, taking into account the limited length of paper, we give an example of releasing geographical data based on SVG document basically including five spatial data types. The SVG document appears in following program code.  Although we have omitted most of the coordinates of spatial points, the structure of the SVG document is full of reservations and clear. The geographical data published by the SVG document rendered on the client shows As shown in Figure1

Because SVG is based on XML, SVG document have its DTD [9  Th e D T D of  SVG d o cu m e n t  is cr eat e d  a t  t h e  same time the SVG document do and is saved in head files, of course, instead, also can be gotten by XML parser A D T D  specifies the structure of a SVG element by specifying the names of its sub-elements and attributes. Sub-element structure is specified using the operators “*”\(set with zero or more elements\ “+”\(set with one or more elements\?”\(optional and “|”\(or\ There is a special attribute Id, which can occur once for each element. The Id attribute uniquely identifies an element within a SVG document and can be referenced through an IDREF field in another element. Figure2 shows a DTD specification. The SVG document in Section3 conforms to this DTD  Figure2 The SVG Document’s DTD A DTD graph represents the structure of a DTD. Its nodes are elements, attributes and operators in the DTD. Each element appear as many times as they appear in the DTD. The DTD graph corresponding to the DTD in Figure2 is given in Figure3   Figure3 DTD graph of svg document  B  The OR Schema Generation Algorithm Traditionally, relational schemas have been derived from a data model such as the Entity-Relationship model. This translation is straightforward, because there is a clear separation between entities and their attributes. Each entity and its attributes are mapped to a relation. when converting a SVG DTD to relations, It is tempting to map each element in the DTD to a relation and map the attributes of the element to attributes of the relation. However, there is no correspondence between elements and attributes of DTD and entities and attributes of the ER-model. Taking an example of node g in the Figure3, It has five child nodes Id  path  use  text  symbol In five nodes, excepting Id others are all not attributes, because they appear in the form of tag in the SVG document. Now, in the process of mapping DTD graph into OR schema, we should

know which node is mapped into independent table and which attributes. In order to solve the problem, we extend the Hybrid method [11 m a p p in g th e D T D o f X M L in to Rel a ti o n a l  database schema, get the new rules of mapping the DTD of SVG document into OR schema. The rules as follows[12   1  relations are created for all elements in the DTD graph whose nodes have an in-degree greater than one 2  Elements nodes with an in-degree of zero are also made separate relations 3  Elements below “*” node are made into separate relations 4  Each element node x that is a separate relation inlines all the nodes y that are reachable from it such that the path from x to y does not contain a node that is to be made a separate relation 5  When one element quotes more than one element node that are created independent relations, in order to let the getting OR schema has less redundant degree, we use several relations between the tag element and the quoted elements to represent this single relation 6  If one element node is CDATA or PCDATA,we add a new attribute of the same name to the element node in order to store the data expressed by the element node According to the above rules, we extend the XML mapping algorithm proposed in Ref[13 t o m a p SV G D T D i n t o  O R  schema. The mapping process consists of two phases. The first phase is to generate the DTD graph based on the given DTD document, and then in the second phase the corresponding Object-relational schema is created on the basis of the generated DTD graph. Alg1[1  i s t h e p s e udo cod e s o f  our improved mapping algorithm. Here, the code line 1~8 are for DTD graph creation, and code line 9~12 are for OR schema generation. We use the ProcessNode\( code line 13~35\ to process the nodes. Applying the above mapping rules and algorithm to the example SVG DTD in section4, we have the resulted OR schema in Figure4. From the Figure4, we get eight relation tables. Among them, Table svg is for storing the basic information of SVG document; Table symbol is for storing the user-defined reusable symbols; In order to get a low redundant OR schema, we divided table g into four tables g_text  g_path  g_symbol  g_use Using the four tables, we record the relation between the layers and the data in the layer; table use is for storing the cited symbol from the table symbol table path is for storing spatial data. It needs to be emphasized that the type of the spatial data in the OR is geometry The geometry in the ORDBMS \(POSTGIS\ is abstract data type and can include other spatial data type \(such as point  polygon  line the same as tag path can express any spatial data type \(the attribute d of tag path with one pair of spatial coordinates indicates point  type; the attribute d having a series of pairs of spatial coordinates and being at the end without character “z” indicates line type, otherwise indicates polygon type\. Of course, we can use tag line  polygon and point to store spatial data in the SVG document. In this case, by mapping rules and algorithm, we can easily get the corresponding table line  polygon and point  There is no detail description of the above circumstances because the given example in this paper store spatial data by tag path  Algorithm1  Mapping SVG DTD to OR schema INPUT 002 DTD of SVG document OUTPUT: the mapped OR schema 1 002 create the tree of DTD  marked as DTD T  T V  T E  2 002 for each T v 002 T V do  3 002 create the corresponding node G v 002 G V 002  4 002 for each T e 002 T E do  5 002 create the corresponding edge G e 002 G E 002  6 002 for each T V a 002 reference as other  element g do  7 002 create the corresponding edge e  a  g  002 G E 002  8 002   G G DTD E V G    9 002 traverse DTD G  10 002 for G V v 002 in-degree and parent node recorded as   deg v in and  v parent respectively 11 002 for each   deg v in 0 or  v parent  G V v 002  12 002 ProcessNode v  002  13 002 Procedure ProcessNode v  14 002 child v the set of child nodes of v  15 002 the number of  *  recorded as starnumb child v  16 002 if starnumb child v 1 then  17 002 for each ch v 002 child v  do  18 002 if ch v  then  19 002 tem v getchild ch v  002 get the child node of ch v  20 002 tem v work as IDREF column 21 002 else if ch v 002 child v and ch v  22 002 ch v work as attribute column 23 endfor  24 002 create a relationship with the corresponding node v  25 002 endif  26 002 if starnumb child v 2 then  27 002 for each ch v 002 child v  003 ch v  do  28 002 tem v getchild ch v  002 get the child node of ch v  29 002 tem v work as IDREF column 30 002 if ch v 002 child v and ch v  then  31 ch v work as attribute column 32 endif  33 002 create a relationship with the corresponding node v  34 002 endfor  35 002 endif

It performs the first part work of Alg1 We conduct some preliminary experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach with a group of SVG document of different sizes from 0.2MB to 12MB, the experimental results are shown in Figure7 and Figure8. Figure7 shows the elapsed times of query processing over SVG document directly and in Object-relational database, from which we can see that by storing SVG document into ORDBMS with our approach, the query processing efficiency can be improved obviously. Figure8 shows the comparison of occupied disk space between in SVG document directly and in object-relational database. For all the tested documents, needs of disk space in SVG document is more than in ORDBMS which is an expected result      000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\024\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\025\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\026\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\027\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\030\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\031\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\032\000\021\000\023\000\023 245 432 6 15 812 9 45 1 1 15 2 25 3 3201 5 94 5 1 21 2 0 T est doc.size 002 KB 002 Time cost 002 sec 002 in document in dat abase  Figure7Searching time cost in database vs in document                    0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 s d 1 s d 2 s d 3 s d 4 sd 5 s d 6 sd 7 sd 8 sd9 sd1 0 Test doc.NO space cost.size 002 KB 002 in document in dat abase  Figure8 Space cost size in document vs in database  Our prototype enables 1\ to create an object-relational schema according to a given SVG DTD by using the mapping rules, and 2\ to store any valid SVG document in relations of the corresponding Object-relational schema, and 3\ to process spatial and non-spatial queries over the stored SVG document VII  CONCLUSION  We basically resolve the low efficiency of search by attribute and the need of high quality hardware in client by storing SVG document in OR database.

 Figure 3. A UML deployment diagram that shows the underlying IT architecture of the value constellation employing TREC and EPCIS for data sharing  Moreover, the model shows the volume of value transactions per a given time frame, enabling a transaction-based financial assessment. To analyze the IT-driven costs that are caused by the underlying architecture, we take a similar, model-based approach and draw a UML deployment diagram. Figure 3 depicts the IT architecture on a high-level granularity with the emphasis on addressing additional financial effects Nodes \(Trader, TREC service provider, carrier and governmental authority\ are named after the stakeholders of the constellation, thus correspond to the actors of the e 3 value model in Figure 2. Software components that are named after the value activities of the value model enable value transaction within the constellation by providing and requesting different web services. Assembly connections connect service interfaces and service ports that facilitate value transactions. Nodes are of interest to us because they express ownership of certain software and hardware assets. Focusing on the Trader node, Figure 3 explains that the Trader owns different software assets \(expressed with component modeling construct to facilitate her data management using EPCIS value activity, namely a standardized EPCIS database  component that stores and provides data of interest b  EPCIS for data sharing to maintain the data distribution, i.e. the data query and transfer of data, and c  security management component using digital certificates to ensure encryption and protection of data since distribution of data happens via open channels Figure 3 also explains that Trader offers export data  to, and receives compliance document from Governmental authority to realize the corresponding value transaction shown in Figure 2. As dependencies between different modeling constructs represent, the realization of this value transaction cannot happen without the employed software components The ownership of components and the financial attributes of UML deployment model constructs allow articulating the IT-driven cost effects on the value performance of stakeholders. Figure 3 exemplifies that to implement the necessary IT assets a Trader needs to pay 30000 Euro investment costs.

modeling constructs to enable a more detailed financial value assessment of stakeholders Based on the performed model-based analysis, we articulated different financial effects that influence the expected benefits of Trader Table 1 summarizes our findings. Similar tables can be drawn for the other stakeholders  Table 1.

Second alternative: introduction of data warehouse service provider  To balance the negative cost effects, another business model is drawn that shows a different configuration of value transactions. The value model in Figure 4 introduces a Data warehouse service provider It offers the complete data management service to different enterprises, who would like to fulfill their customs obligations electronically as proposed, releasing them from certain financial consequences. In return, enterprises pay a fee for the provided service In such business setting, a Trader acts as one of such enterprises. He pays for transportation services similar to Figure 2, and pays 4 Euro compensation fee per container to Data warehouse service provider for maintaining and distributing trade information. The A  dependency path explains that it is the Data warehouse service provider who consumes the container state information services after each container, and pays for the standards to maintain the necessary data repository for data distribution. As a result, the Data warehouse service provider provides the trade information for Governmental authorities  which in return enables a Trader to comply with the customs procedures Changes in network characteristics imply changes in the underlying IT architecture as well. The aligned IT architecture that accommodates the alternative configuration is represented in Figure 5. It is the Data warehouse service provider who provides trade data  to Governmental authorities thus employs the required software and hardware assets. There is no local effort needed from the Trader to facilitate the EPC-based data sharing mechanisms. Yet, to provide the trade data  Data warehouse provider needs the necessary supply chain information from a Trader  The assembly connection between the corresponding service interface and port represents this requirement Due to data confidentiality, data exchange between Trader and Data warehouse service provider is done via virtual private network, as the UML deployment diagram also indicates As the cardinalities of the nodes illustrate, one Data warehouse service provider maintains supply chain data of more Trader nodes. As such Data warehouse provider acts as a hub that aggregates different data sources and distributes them for customs clearance, implying a more efficient solution for data sharing   Figure 4.

Summary of cost effects for Trader  concluded from the value and UML models of the alternative configuration  effect incoming value object effect outgoing value object foreseen costs per month for illustration purposes only cost per transaction transaction volume e 3 value sum transportation with TREC mounted containers fee e 3 value 20 3000 60000  compliance 4 3000 12000   Similar to the first business setting, we articulated different financial effects that influence the expected benefits of Trader For comparison, Table 2 summarizes the value impacts that are articulated via modeling techniques Based on the volume of business transactions, the alternative solution would in principle cause less financial effects for a Trader However, to explore whether and how the introduction of such data management service would be commercially feasible is a non-trivial task. On one hand, the increasing number of enterprises that would consume the service results in higher profit, which, on the other hand conflicted with higher operational costs Concluding from the value model, these costs depend on average numbers of TREC service invocations that are consumer-dependent as the A  dependency path also explains; hence finding this optimum is a complex task. In addition Data warehouse service provider needs to deal with higher investment and operational costs to accommodate the increased intensity of data distribution among governmental authorities. It might appear that over certain trading intensity the Data warehouse service provider needs to reconsider her service offering because her extra operational costs cannot be recovered from the predicted profit As shown, the e 3 value modeling technique allows simulating the volumes of transactions, and enables sensitivity analysis of financial impacts. In this specific financial setting shown in Figure 4 Data warehouse service provider would conclude a positive net cash flow. Assuming the management of data of 20 different enterprises, assuming on average 3000 containers per month for each enterprise, and assuming 4 Euro service    Figure 5. A UML deployment diagram that shows the underlying IT architecture of the alternative  value constellation Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


fee per container would result in 240000 Euro profit for the service provider. Based on the modeled transactions, the profit is contrasted with service fee paid for subscriber maintenance \(assuming 10000 Euro per month\ and container information Supposed that the service provider requests container state information 20 times after each monitored container, the dependency path would simulate on average a volume of 1200000 transactions per month Assuming the same 0.1 Euro compensation fee as before Data warehouse service provider would pay 120000 Euro service fee for receiving container information  5. Lessons learned and outlook for future research  Concluding from the sensitivity analyses we performed by attributing the e 3 value modeling constructs with different financials, our approach allows articulating an economically feasible scenario for stakeholders involved for a specific time frame The analysis is based on the presupposed volume of transactions that foreseen for the modeled time frame, and is determined by the attributed characteristics \(e.g. occurrences of value transfers\ of the modeled constellation. By refining the financial analysis using the cost consequences of the underlying IT, our modeling approach facilitates a value-based alignment process between business and IT As our presented, model-based exploration of possible alternatives conclude, on one hand the financial evaluation of architecture redesign that is required to execute e-customs procedures might block the incentives of a Trader to join the network thus might violate the sustainability of e-customs on a long run. It is contrasted on the other hand with an alternative business design, where these cost factors are re-allocated as a result of outsourcing. The challenge is to find the cost-benefit optimum between implementing the necessary architecture elements inhouse, and consuming different e-services, and outsourcing the data management and related services to the data warehouse provider Typically an outsourced solution would on the one hand have positive financial consequences, as it is also supported via the models. On the other hand outsourcing would imply other technical problems like trust and data security between service provider and enterprises. It might appear that due to e.g. data confidentiality outsourcing would not provide sufficient benefits, i.e. would result in negative value impacts, even if these extra IT costs would significantly decrease. Our model-based analysis currently focuses on the financial concerns only, not yet incorporates other, non-financial value impacts Another concern is the technical feasibility of the proposed architectural solution. In our analysis we only tackled the financial consequences of certain volume of transactions, assuming that there exists a technically feasible solution that accommodates the predicted volume. However, the existence of a reliable IT system that accommodates the increased number of invocations is non-trivial. This can especially be crucial for service providers in order to preserve the level of their service quality. To address such technical concerns, the employed modeling techniques are not suitable; we need to extend our approach to address behavioral concerns \(think of e.g. flexibility\ of the analyzed information system architecture, in conjunction with our model-based approach. Another line of research is the development of guidelines that help making decisions for business and information systems architects while exploring commercial potentials of an e-service offering, which are then expressed using the integrated models we have proposed   6.
