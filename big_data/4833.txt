In this case many statisticians would neglect the simple effect corresponding to rule r2 and only interpret the interaction \(rule r1\ only one of the two is significant, it alone is interpreted and the other one discarded Let’s transpose as follows: when one of the two rules is prevalent over the other, it corresponds to a significant relation; and the other rule is eliminated When the rules r1 and r2 are similar, they are both deemed significant and the rule r2, with smaller number of attributes and therefore being the most general”, is dropped  Definition of mr3 Let {r1,r2} be a couple of rules, it is said to be incoherent for the meta-rule mr3 if the set of attributes of the left side of either is strictly included in the set of attributes of the left side of the other, with the same values, and if the right sides have the same attributes, with the same values for all except one. If r2 has less attributes than r1 on the left side and so is more general mr3 \({r1, r2}\ defined by  if {r1, r2} coherent  if \({r1, r2} incoherent\d \(r1 and r2 noncomparable\d undemanding user  r2} if \({r1, r2} incoherent\d \(r1 and r2 similar  r2} if \({r1, r2} incoherent\ and \(r1 and r2 non comparable\d demanding user  r1} if \({r1, r2} incoherent\d \(r2 is prevalent over r1  r2} if \({r1, r2} incoherent\d \(r1 is prevalent over r2  Meta-rule mr4 : order 1 local/global redundancy Consider the example of the following two rules r1: G1L1 000 R1I1 “Town girls pass and register r2: G1 000 R1I1 Girls pass and register The meta-rule mr4 looks like mr3 but it aims to eradicate redundancy instead of contradiction. To define it, the former meta-rule is re-used but if the incoherent rules are similar or non-comparable, the    5 For a statistical definition of the word significant, the reader my refer to an abundant specialised literature.  It is enough for now to say that a significant event is one that cannot reasonably be attributed to chance.  When such an event occurs the statistical model indicates the variables to which it can be attributed  most local rule \(r1 for this example\ppressed, and not to the most global one as in mr3   6  Simultaneous action of meta-rules  The decision to eradicate a rule that is determined incoherent by a meta-rule is not immediately put into effect, rather the rule is annotated: a tag marks the imperativeness with which the rule may be suppressed After all the meta-rules have been applied, the rules without any tag are kept, the other rules, having one tag, or multiple ones, are considered for suppression This way of operating implies that the result obtained remains independent of the order in which the rules of the set are treated.  A rule, even if it has been tagged for suppressing at one stage, can still contribute to the dropping of another at the next stage. Looking at example 1 and imagining that for each of the sets r2,r3}, {r3,r4}, {r2,r4}, a meta-rule for which they are incoherent can be found, as r2 is prevalent over r3, r3 is prevalent over r4, and r4 is prevalent over r2, the three rules will be dropped in the end, as common sense suggests   7  Application  7.1  The dataset  The LUCAS0 dataset has been created in the framework of the Causality Challenge  www.causality.inf.ethz.ch a “toy” workbench for adjusting and testing causality extraction methods before dealing with real life datasets    Figure 1 : Graph for LUCAS0 \(see www.causality.inf.ethz.ch for details  We have not used the whole causality workbench, but the only LUCA0 training set, which consists of 2000 examples described by 12 binary variables such as anxiety  smoking  fatigue The graphic model sketched in fig. 1 is a Bayesian network used for generating these examples. It has been designed so as

to mimic a few causes and consequences of lung cancer. One control variable \(“Born in even day related to none of the others  7.2  Our objective  We are not trying to tackle the complex problem of causal relationships – several “manipulated” test sets are provided for this purpose in the Causality Challenge – but the only problem of detecting the minimal set of relevant and non-redundant relations in the training set. Which translates, in this context, as representing the diverse links between variables as an association rule set cleansed and condensed by our meta-rules  7.3  Our project scheme  Our work has been structured as follows: the names of the 12 variables have been condensed with the two first letters of their labels \(see table 3\d an extra digit, 1 or 0, corresponding to the variable itself or its negation. We have extracted 100 000 association rules or so with support >= 100 and confidence >=0.1, and with a unique variable in their right size  Table 3: Variable labels and their abbreviations Al An At Bo Ca Co  Allergy Anxiety Attention Disorder Born an Even Day Car Accident Coughing  Fa Ge Lu Pe Sm Ye Fatigue Genetics Lung Cancer Peer Pressure Smoking Yellow Fingers  We have then applied each of our meta-rules independently on the resulting rule set. We chose the support and confidence as quality measures, and the thresholds for significant difference 100 for support 0.1 for confidence When a couple of rules is deemed consistent by a meta-rule, no digit is added to their tags. If it is not, the digits 0, 1, or “nc” are appended to one or both in accordance to their degree of requirement for elimination  the digit 1 if one of the two has much less credit appended to this rule  the digit 0 if both are equally reliable as regard to the meta-rule \(appended to both rules in the case of mr1 and mr2, to the most general rule in the case of mr3, to the most local in the case of mr4  the digit “nc” if they cannot be compared appended in the same manner than the digit 0  When all the meta-rules have been used on the whole rule set, tags of each tagged rule are examined with a precedence order: the digit 1 is chosen if one digit 1 at least is present; if not, the digit 0 is chosen if one digit 0 at least is present; “nc” is chosen in the remaining case if one digit “nc” at least is present These tags are useful in the interpretative stage of our workflow: all the non-tagged rules remain for interpretation, but “nc” rules may be useful if the set of non-tagged rules is judged defective. If it is still not enough, the rules tagged “0” may be examined. For the occasion, the parameters of the meta-rules may be revised \(relative weights of the different measures difference thresholds  7.4  Results  We have shown in table 4 below a few examples of rule couples assessed as in consistent according to one meta-rule or another, and their resulting tags The first column identifies the involved meta-rule the next two columns list the couple of rules to be compared \(between brackets: support and confidence In the fourth column are displayed the differences of quality measures, to be compared with the thresholds The fifth column sketches the results of the fourth: -1 if the first is by far lower than the second, 1 if the opposite is true, 0 else. The conclusion is drawn in column 6, translated in column 7 into the resulting digit, with the code of the rule to which it is attached The first row of the table 4 reads as follows according to the mr1 meta-rule the couple of rules Yellow_Fingers 000 no Lung Cancer and Yellow_Fingers 000 Lung Cancer has been estimated inconsistent. The support of the first rule is 296 and its confidence is 0.189, far beyond the corresponding values of the second rule \(1268 and 0.811\ The differences overpass the values considered significant as stated in the fourth column and sketched in the fifth one. The differences for this couple are marked \(-1,-1 see §4\which means that the first rule is poorer than the second, due both to support and confidence. In column 6, we conclude that r2 prevails on r1, and in column 7 the ”1” tag is attributed to r1 \(“first to be dropped” type  The table 5 shows the results obtained when tagging the 100,000 rules: each row of the table gives the cumulative count of the rules tagged for a possible elimination, dispatched by number of variables in the left part. Almost all of the rules \(96,981\ave been tagged “1” because of contradiction \(mr1 or mr3 redundancy \(mr2 or mr4\hen compared to better rules. 268 rules have been tagged “0” because of contradiction or redundancy as regard to rules of similar quality. The latter will be eliminated if one specially cares for consistency of the rule set

It is also strongly linked to Car_Accident \(s=1111, c=0.77  Bi-directional relations connect Car_Accident Coughing, Fatigue, with a support superior to 1000 and a confidence beyond 0.75  The same type of relations link Smoking, Anxiety and Yellow_Fingers with a support superior to 1000 and a confidence beyond 0.70; each one involves Car_Accident with the same quality  Additional knowledge follows from the association rules  Lung Cancer implies no Allergy, no Attention_Disorder, no Peer_Pressure, with a

The differences between the generating model and this operational and condensed rule set concern essentially 1\e direction of the rules, which seldom contradicts causality, 2\ the loss of a few links with small support despite of strong confidence, such as Genetics 000 Lung Cancer, 3\he loss of interaction rules, with two variables at the left side and one at the right one \(Smoking + Genetics vs Lung Cancer The first point is a general problem for knowledge extraction from observational data. Mere observation seems not enough for establishing causal links, and experimental manipulation of some variables seems unavoidable, as in statistical “design of experiment”, or as in the variants embedded in the test sets of the Causality Challeng  As the second point is concerned, the meta-rule could be changed in order to favour confidence instead of support. In this example, the choice of support could eliminate rare illnesses or effects, which is questionable in a medical context Concerning the third point, the non-identification of an interaction follows from the choice of measures chosen in this first application because of their simple computation and clear interpretation – and from the choice of the difference thresholds: these options prevent small interaction effects, such as the one built in the data, from being detected As a whole, our method retrieves the essential part of the structure of the data, but an effort remains to propose to the user different choices of parameters  9  Assessment and Perspectives  Our global mining method is incompatible with an incremental cleaning procedure, as follows from section 6 above; the essence of our method is to consider a rule set as a whole first, before the cleansing phase. It is to be noticed that this feature enables us to cleanse sets of rules obtained by the fusion of rule sets extracted from different sets of subjects for the same properties, or suggested by an expert  The meta-rules presented here are easy to use by anybody since they rest on common sense.  They apply to the complete set of rules extracted from data and the only requirement for these rules is their having a nonzero support.  They reduce the size of the set by eliminating contradictions and redundancies.  We also pointed out that the user had to choose parameters such as extra quality measures or different thresholds according to the type of knowledge he/she wants to mine in the data. He/she should be helped in this matter by being suggested various parameter sets adapted to diverse situations. One perspective of research in this area is the progressive building of a coherent cleansing system, developing its generality and enhancing the performance and scalability of the corresponding software One criticism against this technique may be the use of properties with negations, which greatly weigh down the research algorithms with the frequent itemsets and association rules if the properties with negations are not planned for from the start. There are however, numerous cases where coding leads to both the property and its negation being present in the base for example coding the variable “Gender” into two variables “female”, “male”\. In some other cases coding produces a series of properties which form a partition of the subjects determined by the various values of one and the same property \(for example coding the quantitative variable “Blood Pressure” into Normal BP”, “High BP”, and “Low BP”\This coding into more than two categories also produces incoherencies in the sets of rules, as it is an extension of the case of a property and its negation which has been dealt with in this chapter.  The meta-rules must then be re-written in a more generalising manner.  This is another direction research can take

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
