Overview of Mondou web search engine using text mining and information visualizing technologies Hiroyuki Kawano Department of Systems Science Graduate School of Informatics Kyoto University Japan kawanooi kyoto-u ac j p Abstract As th,e volume of web pages in the internet is in creasing rapidly it is becoming hard for use to dis cover valuable web resources Especially it is dificult for naive users to discover informative pages by 
pop ular web search engines since they don't have back ground and dom.ain knowledge about the status of web systems Therefore many kinds of web search engines have been developed in order to support the processes of web information retrieval We are developing Japanese web search engine Mondou RCAAU Though our engine is one of the first generation of web search engines we try to imple ment the rapid emerging technologies 
of data mining in our search engine from 1995 We are also implement ing the java applet based on the information visualiza tion In this paper we describe the technical overviews of our Mondou web sea.rch engine One of most impor tant techniques is the text mining algorithms based on the primitive a.ssociation rules Mondou provides highly relevant feedba.ck keywords to users in order to support search steps Using th,e associative keywords users can 
modify the combination of keywords in the initial query We also introduce the concept of integrated query mech anism for diffe,rent sea.rch engines based on the KQML age n.ts Furthermore in order to visualize the characteris tics of search results we are developing java applets to display the ROC graph and the clusters of specijic doc umen.ts We are also trying to improve web robots for the Mondou system in the view point 
of data cleaning Finally we discuss the eflectiveness and performance of our web search engine 0-7695-1022-1/01 S10.00 0 2001 IEEE 1 Introduction Many kinds of web search engines such as Yahoo 23 AltaVista[2 g00[20 fresheye[6 google[7 and so many others[21 have been developed How ever as the volunie of data on the web is increasing rapidly it is becoming difficult for naive users to browse informative web pages Especially, in the case of 
that users can't select the appropriate combination of key words in the query it is impossible to discover valuable web resources For example if one keyword have different meanings in different domains it becomes very difficult to select the suitable combination of keywords In this case we have to carefully choose the combination of keywords in the query In order to resolve these problems many advanced techniques have been implemented for the support of web information retrieval In order to help the procedures 
of web resource discovery we also try to implement several emerging technologies such as data mining[9 191 and java ap plets though our developed Mondou search engine is one of first generation of search engines[l4 In this paper we describe the concept of Mondou system in the view points of web/text mining[5 and information visualization[3  In Section 2 we describethe total architecture of the Mondou search engine which supports the procedures of web information retrieval Our 
proposed framework can also support the discovery process for intranet re sources, e-mails, electric news and other kinds of com mercial databases In Section 3 we introduce the al gorithm of weighted association rule which is imple Discovery1 is in the processes of questions and answers the name of Mondou comes from one of sophisticated discus sion styles in Japanese The URL of Mondou search engine is http://www.kuamp.kyoto-u.ac.jp/labs/infocom/mondou index-e  html 234

3.1 Weighted association rule We start a brief introduction to the mining algo rithm for association rules[l Given a set of docu ments where each document consists of keywords an association rule is an expression X  Y where X and Y are sets of keywords The intuitive meaning of such a rule is that docu ments which contain the keywords X tend to also con tain the keywords Y The support of the rule X  Y is the percentage of documents that contain both X and Y We easily extend the association algorithm to con sider frequency and importantness of keywords, which appears in web documents Our web robot gives the appropriate weight value to the keywords depending on the frequency and the kind of HTML tags However we have to pay our attention that it is very difficult to set the appropriate threshold and weight values in order to derive meaningful rules 3.2 Association rules derived from different at tributes In order to derive more effective rules by Mondou we classify several attributes and use the relationships of different attributes Shortly speaking in order to expand a keyword space we derive weighted associ ation rules not only from one attribute but also the relationship among several attributes[l3 Table 2 Categorization of attribute types damental characteristics of a database These values are provided by the au thors the publishers or the editors which describe the contents ex Abstract Section Titles, Index a database ex Author Publisher Size Date For example in order to expand a keyword space appropriately and use several attributes effectively we categorize attributes in the database into three cate gories in Table 2 by their semantic properties And we try to derive meaningful association rules by join operations in these types As shown in Table 3 characteristic and supplement attributes generally do not include enough numbers of keywords for association mining it is hard to derive appropriate rules only from such attributes Table 3 Keyword space of the attribute cate gories Catkeorv I Kevword mace I INSPEC Averaee 11 I Characteristic I  Description 1 Small  Large 1 Abstract 183 Supplement 1 Small 1 Author 3 Therefore we try to extend the basic algorithm to increase the number of related keywords by giving a relationship of different attributes which is shown in Figure 2 For example we give a relationship between Title A and Author A in order to expand keywords of Title Simply speaking this step means the ex tension of the keyword space which is written by the same author Authors oEten store their related pages in the same directory or under the directory almost of pages are tightly linked each other Thus we can derive inore effective rules based on a relationship of several attributes Database u:eY:e:a:F Cluster set L 0 0 r2 tr I eved retrieved ded Relati by G by Relatiopship e Keword Set E Figure 2 Extension of a keyword space using the relationship of different attributes Our proposed mining algorithm is summarized in the following Algorithm 1 Extended mining association algo rithms with different attributes Input A keyword set 6 given in the initial query A characteristic type of attribute A A characteristic type of attribute A and a at tribute A related to A 236

Furthermore, Figure 5 shows an example of visual izing results for the initial query with a keyword 223me diator\224 In the Figure 5 the numerical number shows the related clusters of documents satisfying the combi nation of selected black keywords 4 Data cleaning aspect of web robots When we implement the program of web robot more effectively it is very important to collect meaningful web pages fast Therefore in the following subsections we focus on the mining techniques in the view points of data cleaning 4.1 Simple guideline of robot architecture The web robots collect the data using http proto cols For instance the web robot send the following characters in Table.5 in order to retrieve the web data from servers The simple web robot visits web servers sequentially with the following breadt h-first algorithm Algorithm 2 Breadth-first traversal algorithm 1 Define So SI sets of all the server that has been found 2 foreach s E SI do 3 Get information about documents d on s from Database 4 Robot Evaluates and analyzes d and stores data to Database At the point if he finds un known servers he adds them to So if not then stop 5 SI  So and continue to 2 Table 5 Request message in the retrieval step HEAD path HTTP/1.0 Accept text/html From infocom-w3-search@kuamp.kyoto-u.ac.jp Referer http://www.kuamp.kyoto-u.ac.jp User-Agent rcaau/l.X Moreover for advanced web robots in order to re duce the load of network and the number of web server access the programs are implemented based on the co operative processes Web robots developers also have to pay the attention to the behavior of the robot by the 223/robots txt file\224 according to the robots guideline[l7 4.2 Focused crawling algorithm by hyper links When we browse web pages we usually try to evalu ate the relationship between the target page and other web links Therefore in this subsection we try to char acterize the structure of hyper links, in order to develop fast traversing techniques of important clusters of web pages in the same and different web servers  inside links outside links   _.--....__ 221 site    ____  Figure 6 Features of hyper links in side/outside links As you know very well we can depict the web links as loosely connected hyper graph we try to discover the interesting features of the web pages based on the two different hyper links 0 Inside link the link to other pages on the same web server 0 Outside link the link to other pages on the other web servers In the first step we give the score of hyper links by these values sp ip op which is the combination of the document size the number of inside links and the number of outside links for the parent document P in Figure 6 Then each child document CI is referred from the parent P we can also evaluate sk ik 01 val ues for Ck We proposed the following focused crawling algo rithm based on the assumption that the important web pages are referred many times from other servers Algorithm 3 Focused crawling algorithm 1 Define the following sets about server s 239

When Mondou systems materialize the association rules by using key words which appear in many queries and scan the ma terialized association rules to return the result we can reduce the waiting time dramatically[ll Of course parallel computing and cluster architectures must be effective for data mining We have already implemented several kinds of meth ods such as sampling materialization and parallel computing and had evaluations of these techniques in 131 6 Conclusions The scale of web communities is increasing espo nentially it makes hard to discover the useful or suit able resources including informative knowledge Aid in the case of search for common information resources it is very difficult to determine the combination of key words In order to resolve these problems we developed the Mondou search system In this paper we described the overview of Mondou in the view points of data min ing technologies such as text mining web mining and information visualization Especially we discussed that it was effective for users to decide the combination of keywords using the associative keywords and the visual interface Finally we can conclude that our proposed algorithms and vi sual interface work very effectively for web searches At present we discussed the primitive conimunica tion protocols for community oriented web search en gines and the basic characteristics of the web communi ties derived from web graphs[l5 Then we are trying to implement the advanced communication protocols in order to derive more reliable results from the web communities Since the quality and the reliability of web contents are tightly related to the members or web pages in web communities Acknowledgment I would like to thank Assistant Professor Ninoru Kawahara in Data Processing Center Kyoto Univer sity A part of this work is supported by the grant of Scientific Research 10780259 12792015 from the 240

8.2  Effects of minimum confidence The next experiment \(Figure 6\ws the effect of varying minconf while fixing minimp and minsup to very low values. With connect-4, we used a minimum coverage of 1%, and with pums, a minimum coverage of 5%. Minimp was set to .0002 with both data-sets. As can be extrapolated from the previous figures, the number of rules meeting these weak minimp and minsup constraints would be enormous As a result, with these constraints alone, Dense-Miner exceeds the available memory of our machine The efficiency of Dense-Miner when minimum confidence is specified shows that it is effectively exploiting the confidence constraint to prune the set of rules explored. We were unable to use lower settings of minconf than those plotted because of the large number of rules. As minconf is increased beyond the point at which fewer than 100,000 rules are returned, the run-time of Dense-Miner rapidly falls to around 500 seconds on both data-sets 8.3  Summary of experimental findings These experiments demonstrate that Dense-Miner, in contrast to approaches based on finding frequent itemsets achieves good performance on highly dense data even when the input constraints are set conservatively. Minsup can be set low \(which is necessary to find high confidence rules as can minimp and minconf \(if it is set at all\This characteristic of our algorithm is important for the end-user who may not know how to set these parameters properly. Low default values can be automatically specified by the system so that all potentially useful rules are produced. Refinements of the default settings can then be made by the user to tailor this result. In general, the execution time required by Dense-Miner correlates strongly with the number of rules that satisfy all of the specified constraints 9.     Conclusions We have shown how Dense-Miner exploits rule constraints to efficiently mine consequent-constrained rules from large and dense data-sets, even at low supports. Unlike previous approaches, Dense-Miner exploits constraints such as minimum confidence \(or alternatively, minimum lift or conviction\ and a new constraint called minimum improvement during the mining phase. The minimum improvement constraint prunes any rule that does not offer a significant predictive advantage over its proper sub-rules. This increases efficiency of the algorithm, but more importantly it presents the user with a concise set of predictive rules that are easy to comprehend because every condition of each rule strongly contributes to its predictive ability The primary contribution of Dense-Miner with respect to its implementation is its search-space pruning strategy which consists of the three critical components: \(1\functions that allow the algorithm to flexibly compute bounds on confidence, improvement, and support of any rule derivable from a given node in the search tree; \(2\proaches for reusing support information gathered during previous database passes within these functions to allow pruning of nodes before they are processed; and \(3\ item-ordering heuristic that ensures there are plenty of pruning opportunities. In principle, these ideas can be retargeted to exploit other constraints in place of or in addition to those already described We lastly described a rule post-processor that DenseMiner uses to fully enforce the minimum improvement constraint. This post-processor is useful on its own for determining the improvement value of every rule in an arbitrary set of rules, as well as associating with each rule its proper sub-rule with the highest confidence. Improvement can then be used to rank the rules, and the sub-rules used to potentially simplify, generalize, and improve the predictive ability of the original rule set References 1 w a l  R.; Im ie lin ski  T   a n d S w a m i, A. 1 9 9 3   M i n i ng As so ciations between Sets of Items in Massive Databases.

The data flows in continuously and is processed daily Mining association rules dynamically has the following benefits 267  223Real-time\224 data mining, that is, the rules are drawn from the latest transactions for reflecting the current commercial trends 267  Multilevel knowledge abstraction, which requires summarizing multiple partial results. For example association rules on the month or year basis cannot be concluded from daily mining results. In fact multilevel mining is incremental in nature 267  For scalability, incremental and distributed mining has become a practical choice Figure 3: Distributed rule mining Incremental association rule mining requires combining partial results. It is easy to see that the confidence and support of multiple rules may not be combined directly. This is why we treat them as \223views\224 and only maintain the association cube, the population cube and the base cube that can be updated from each new copy of volume cube. Below, we discuss several cases to show how a GDOS can mine association rules by incorporating the partial results computed at LDOSs 267  The first case is to sum up volume-cubes generated at multiple LDOSs. Let C v,i be the volume-cube generated at LDOS i The volume-cube generated at the GDOS by combining the volume-cubes fed from these LDOSs is 345   n i i v v C C 1  The association rules are then generated at the GDOS from the centralized C v  214  The second case is to mine local rules with distinct bases at participating LDOSs, resulting in a local association cube C a,I a local population cube C p,I  and a local base cube C b,i at each LDOS. At the GDOS, multiple association cubes, population cubes and base cubes sent from the LDOSs are simply combined, resulting in a summarized association cube and a summarized population cube, as 345   n i i a a C C 1   345   n i i p p C C 1  and 345   n i i b b C C 1  The corresponding confidence cube and support cube can then be derived as described earlier. Cross-sale association rules generated from distinct customers belong to this case In general, it is inappropriate to directly combine association cubes that cover areas a 1 205, a k to cover a larger area a In the given example, this is because association cubes record counts of customers that satisfy   customer product merchant time area Doe TV Dept Store 98Q1 California Doe VCR Dept Store 98Q1 California customer product merchant time area Doe VCR Sears 5-Feb-98 San Francisco Joe PC OfficeMax 7-Feb-98 San Francisco customer product merchant time area Doe TV Fry's 3-Jan-98 San Jose Smith Radio Kmart 14-Jan-98 San Jose Association   population      base          confidence      support cube               cube                cube         cube                cube LDOS LDOS GDOS 


the association condition, and the sets of customers contained in a 1 205, a k are not mutually disjoint. This can be seen in the following examples 214  A customer who bought A and B in both San Jose and San Francisco which are covered by different LDOSs , contributes a count to the rule covering each city, but has only one count, not two, for the rule A  336  B covering California 214  A customer \(e.g. Doe in Figure 3\who bought a TV in San Jose, but a VCR in San Francisco, is not countable for the cross-sale association rule TV  336 VCR covering any of these cities, but countable for the rule covering California. This is illustrated in Figure 3 6  Conclusions In order to scale-up association rule mining in ecommerce, we have developed a distributed and cooperative data-warehouse/OLAP infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to generate association rules with enhanced expressive power, by combining information of discrete commercial activities from different geographic areas, different merchants and over different time periods. In this paper we have introduced scoped association rules  association rules with conjoint items and functional association rules as useful extensions to association rules The proposed infrastructure has been designed and prototyped at HP Labs to support business intelligence applications in e-commerce. Our preliminary results validate the scalability and maintainability of this infrastructure, and the power of the enhanced multilevel and multidimensional association rules. In this paper we did not discuss privacy control in customer profiling However, we did address this issue in our design by incorporating support for the P3P protocol [1 i n  ou r data warehouse. We plan to integrate this framework with a commercial e-commerce system References 1  Sameet Agarwal, Rakesh Agrawal, Prasad Deshpande Ashish Gupta, Jeffrey F.
