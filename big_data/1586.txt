INTRODUCTION\nTrade Wind \(T-Wind 1] similar to other cloud frameworks [2]\nsuch as OpenStack1 and OpenNebula2. However, it not\nonly offers infrastructural functionalities for cloud low-level\norchestration, but also bene?ts from the concept of reusable\nbuilding blocks.\nThe increasing volume of data \(e.g. from social networks,\nsensor networks motivated the development of big\ndata solutions both for batch and real-time processing. This\nresearch aims to evaluate performance gains and feasibility\nof a new distributed processing feature for T-Wind, suitable\nfor big data applications and for working with large data\nsets. This paper presents the status of the development of\nthis feature, the results from preliminary tests, and the next\nsteps for the project.\nII. TRADE WIND DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING\nT-Wind is organized as follows:\n• Core: Transparent interfaces to manage resources,\nusers, and other cloud entities.\n• Features: Implementation of basic functions, such as\nvirtual machine creation and resource usage optimiza-\ntion algorithms.\n• Services: Sophisticated combination of features. For\nexample, virtualization and resource optimization tech-\nniques can be used to eliminate redundant data ?ows\nin the network [1].\n1http://www.openstack.org/\n2http://opennebula.org/\n• Applications Integration of services, which compose\na complete end-to-end solution, for example video\nstreaming.\nThis multi-layered organization promotes ef?cient devel-\nopment of applications on top of the robust core provisioned\nby T-Wind.\nThe T-Wind Distributed Processing \(TWDP controller module that is re-\nsponsible for task and resource management and the worker\nmodules \(or nodes that do the actual data processing. The\ninput is split by the controller and the parts are distributed to\nthe workers. The workers execute the adequate algorithms\nand generate partial results, which are aggregated by the\ncontroller, producing the ?nal output. It is crucial that the\nresults generated by TWDP are the same from the ones\nobtained when executing the algorithms in a single machine\n\(unless the tested algorithms are non-deterministic, which is\nnot the case between T-\nWind and conventional processing \(using a single machine from the Canadian\nNational Climate Data and Information Archive3. The data\nsets contain non-structured hourly weather information col-\nlected from 190 stations and some of them have historical\ndata from over 50 years For each Canadian province it was\ncalculated the monthly average temperature and humidity.\nOver 7 GB of data were downloaded, cleaned, and ag-\ngregated into a single CSV ?le with almost 2 GB. This\nconstitutes over 40 million records with information about\nthe province, station number, timestamp, temperature, and\nhumidity. In order to analyze performance with a larger set\nof data it was also produced a 20 GB ?le by replicating the\noriginal one by ten times.\nThe test environment was created using a set of identical\nIntel Xeon E3-1230 machines with 3.2 GHz and 16 GB\n3http://climate.weatherof?ce.gc.ca/\n2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data\n978-0-7695-5006-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.74\n437\nof RAM memory. They were arranged in a star network\ntopology using a Netgear GSM7328SO switch.\nConsidering the ?le type used, data organization, pro-\ngramming language \(Python processing power of\n17 MB/s. Regarding I/O, creating a local copy of a ?le\nwas performed at 70 MB/s, while transferring it to another\nmachine was executed at 11 MB/s. These values were used\nto implement basic load balancing mechanisms.\nBesides the raw time reduction, in order to compare the\nperformance results, it was also calculated the speedup and\nef?ciency [3] of the developed solutions. Each test was\nexecuted ten times and results represent the average of each\nset of tests.\nB. Implementation and results\nThroughout the tests three different versions of the dis-\ntributed processing feature were developed. The ?rst one\n\(version A equal splitting technique to divide the\ninput for each machine so that each generated part had the\nsame size The results for the single machine setup \(create\na local copy of the ?le and then process it TWDP\nversion A are presented in Tables I and II.\nTABLE I\nTest 1: Single \(conventional 04:44\n20 GB 49:29\nTABLE II\nTest 2: Two machines\n\(TWDP version A 


le it is observed a 40% of time reduction.\nThis represents a speedup of 1.65 and an ef?ciency of 83%.\nFor the 20 GB ?le the results were similar, with a 37% of\ntime reduction, speedup of 1.59, and ef?ciency of 80%.\nFrameworks such as Hadoop4 divide the input into smaller\nblocks, usually ranging from 64 MB to 128 MB. On the\nother hand, TWDP version A was dividing the input in equal\nparts, thus generating 1 GB and 10 GB parts for the 2 GB\nand 20 GB ?les, respectively. Based on this principle, the\nsplitting function was modi?ed to generate 64 MB blocks\n\(version B machines\n\(TWDP version B TWDP version C 01:08 20:23\nFor the 2 GB ?le the results were better than version\nA, with 55% time reduction, speedup of 2.24 and 112%\n4http://hadoop.apache.org/\nef?ciency. However, for the 20 GB the results were worse\nthan version A 25% of time reduction, 1.33 of speedup and\n66% ef?ciency for splitting the input and that it is possible to vary this\nsize in order to achieve better performance.\nBased on this idea, a third version of the feature was\ndeveloped \(version C splitting, using block\nsizes of 32 MB, 64 MB, 128 MB, 256 MB, and 512 MB. The\nresults are exhibited in Table IV. In this test three machines\nwere used, one of them with a dedicated controller module,\nwhich implemented a basic load balancing mechanism based\non processing power and I/O capabilities.\nIn terms of performance, the best result for the 2 GB\n?le was obtained with both 64 MB and 128 MB splitting. If\ncompared to the single machine test, T-Wind reached 81% of\ntime reduction, 5.16 of speedup, and 172% of ef?ciency. For\nthe 20 GB ?le the 128 MB splitting was the best, with 59%\nof time reduction, 2.46 of speedup, and 82% of ef?ciency.\nIV CONSIDERATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThe preliminary results indicate that T-Wind provides the\ninfrastructure to implement the cloud distributed processing\nfeature, achieving performance gains in terms of speedup\nand ef?ciency. However, it will only be possible to come to\nmore solid conclusions after executing tests with larger data\nsets and using more machines, considering that a tenfold\nincrease in ?le size has halved the speedup.\nThe future work is summarized by the following points:\n• Run tests with larger data sets and more machines.\n• Enhance and automate the load balancing feature.\n• Implement other features, such as data redundancy to\noffer integrity and availability.\n• Compare TWDP with other distributed computing\nframeworks such as Storm5 and Hadoop.\nIt is also planned to formalize TWDP architecture and use\nit to solve other problems with different types of data.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the Research and Develop-\nment Center, Ericsson Telecomunicações S.A., Brazil.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C.

line of apsides \nprecess, leading to much more variable relay contacts, with \nsignificant variation in the local time of relay opportunities \nas well as the slant range and resulting data rates that can be \nachieved on any given contact.  MEX relay services are \nprovided by the Melacom UHF transceiver, built by \nQinetiQ Like ODY’s CE-505, it operates at the same fixed \nforward and return link frequencies.  Melacom supports nreturn link data rates of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 kbps.  \nLike ODY, MEX can also acquire an open-loop recording \nof a received UHF signal, with 1-bit-per-sample resolution \nat a 40 kHz sampling rate. \nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter \nMRO, like ODY, operates in a low-altitude, sun-\nsynchronous orbit; it’s ascending node is oriented at ~3 PM \nLMST.  MRO incorporates the newer Electra UHF \nTransceiver \(EUT services [6].  It \nsupports the CCSDS Proximity-1 protocol and, like ODY’s \nCE-505 transceiver, also supports an unreliable raw data \nmode that bypasses the Prox-1 protocol.  Electra is a \nsoftware-defined radio, in which effectively all of the \nradio’s functionality is implemented in flight-\nreprogrammable software and firmware [7].  Electra \nfeatures a number of new capabilities, relative to prior \nproximity link radios: \n Higher Data Rates:  Electra can operate at data \nrates in all powers of 2 from 1 kbps up to 2,048 \nkbps. \n Frequency-Agility:  Instead of operating at a fixed \nforward and return link frequency, Electra can \noperate its forward link anywhere within the 435-\n450 MHz sub-band, and the return link anywhere \nwithin the 390-405 MHz sub-band.   \n• Suppressed-Carrier Modulation:  In addition to the \nconventional residual-carrier, bi-phase modulation \nimplemented by the CE-505 and Melacom, Electra \nalso supports fully suppressed carrier modulation nmaking all the transmitted power available for the \ndata channel. \n• Adaptive Data Rates:  All prior Mars relay \noperations have utilized fixed data rates, requiring \na priori analysis to select the best fixed rate that \nwould maximize data return on any given relay \npass, after accounting for the highly variable \nreceived signal level on the link over the duration \nof the relay contact due to time-varying slant range \nand antenna angles.  By contrast, Electra supports \nan Adaptive Data Rate mode in which the \ntransceiver monitors the signal-to-noise ratio of the \nreturn link symbol-tracking loop and uses these \nreal-time observations of the actual channel \nperformance to make decisions about when the \ndata rate can be increased or needs to be decreased.  \nThe orbiter then sends directives on the forward \nlink to the lander to execute those data rate nchanges, using standardized CCSDS Proximity-1 \n“COMM_CHANGE” directives, allowing the link \nto operate at the highest possible data rate at all \ntimes throughout the pass.  \n• Full-Spectrum Recording:  Electra can acquire a \nhigh-fidelity recording of a received UHF signal, \nover a Nyquist-sampled bandwidth at rates up to n150 kHz.  Unlike ODY’s and MEX’s 1-bit-per-\nsample recording capability, Electra acquires 8-bit-\nin-phase I Q Gain Control value, enabling \nground post-processing to reconstruct the observed \nspectrum and also to demodulate a high-rate \ntelemetry signal. \nMars Relay Operations Service \nComplementing these various Mars relay orbiters, the \nMars Exploration Program has implemented a suite of \nweb-based tools, known as the Mars Relay Operations \nService \(MaROS  interfaces for \neach lander and orbiter participating in Mars relay \noperations, and supports all aspects of relay planning \nand scheduling, as well as post-pass relay performance \nassessment and data accountability Implemented after \ncompletion of the Phoenix Lander mission, and \nincorporating lessons learned in relay support to \nPhoenix as well as to the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, \nMaROS allows each mission – lander or orbiter - to \nestablish a single standardized ground data system \ninterface for all relay services, rather than having to \nimplement separate bilateral interfaces with each \nindividual relay partner, and provides full visibility of \nall relay planning and performance data to each mission \nthroughout the lifecycle of every relay pass. \n2. MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY MISSION \nOVERVIEW \nThe fundamental science objective of the MSL mission is to \nexplore the habitability of Mars, determining whether the \npast or present Martian environment could have supported \nmicrobial life [9].  To carry this out, MSL delivered the \nhighly capable Curiosity rover to Gale Crater.  The rover, as \ndepicted in Figure 1, carries a number of remote sensing \nimaging cameras and spectrometers, and is also equipped \nwith the capability to acquire in situ samples and deliver \n 978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 4 \nthem to a pair of analytical instruments within the rover nTable 2 lists the full MSL science instrument suite.   \nMany of these instruments are capable of generating large \nquantities of data, driving the need for high-bandwidth relay \ncommunications.  For instance, the Mastcam is a high-\nresolution stereo camera mounted on the rover’s mast, \ncapable of acquiring multispectral images and even short \nHigh Definition videos. Mastcam can acquire panoramic \ncolor mosaics with data volumes of several hundred \nmegabits.  Other cameras include a Mars Hand Lens Imager \n\(MAHLI arm, for close-up, high-\nresolution imaging of selected targets, as well as multiple \nengineering navigation cameras \(navcams hazcams EDL 


involved a \nnumber of new technologies driven by the large rover mass \n\(the largest spacecraft ever delivered to the Martian surface allowing access \nto scientifically more compelling landing sites guided entry trajectory during the \nhypersonic phase of EDL, and a powered-descent stage that \nused eight monopropellant hydrazine rocket thrusters to \ndecelerate and then acted as a “skycrane” by hovering while \nit lowered Curiosity gently to the surface on a 7.6 m tether.  \nDetails of the MSL EDL system are described in 10]. \nMSL employs a combination of X-band direct-to-Earth \nlinks and UHF relay links to accomplish its mission goals \n[11].  X-band communication is accomplished with a Small \nDeep Space Transponder, paired with a 100 W Traveling \nWave Tube Amplifier on the descent stage for use during \ncruise and EDL, and a 15 W Solid State Power Amplifier on \nthe rover for surface operations.  UHF communication uses \nthe Electra-Lite UHF Transceiver \(ELT illustrates the various X-band and UHF antennas \nused during EDL and on the surface.  The entry vehicle had ntwo X-band low-gain antennas \(LGAs PLGA symmetry \naxis of the spacecraft, and a Tilted LGA \(TLGA vector during the \nguided entry phase when the spacecraft was flying with a \nnon-zero angle of attack.  The entry vehicle also had a wrap-\naround UHF antenna on the parachute cone called the \nParachute UHF \(PUHF antenna.  Once the rover and the \nattached powered descent stage dropped out of the aeroshell, \n \n \n \nFigure 2:  MSL telecommunications antenna \nconfigurations for a operations \nFigure 1:  Illustration of MSL’s Curiosity Rover \nTable 2:  MSL Science Instrument Suite \nCameras n \n• Mast Camera \(Mastcam MAHLI MARDI Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer \n\(APXS ChemCam Chemistry & Mineralogy X-Ray \nDiffraction/X-Ray Fluorescence \nInstrument \(CheMin SAM RAD Neutrons \(DAN REMS n• Mars Science Laboratory Entry Descent \nand Landing Instrument \(MEDLI 2013 IEEE \n 5 \nX-band transmission was via a Descent LGA \(DLGA utilized a \nDescent UHF antenna \(DUHF RUHF nskycrane phase and after touchdown.

CRITICAL EVENT COMMUNICATIONS nSUPPORT FOR ENTRY, DESCENT, AND \nLANDING \nMSL was launched from Cape Canaveral, FL, on Nov 26, \n2011.  After an Earth-Mars cruise of just over 8 months, the \nspacecraft arrived at Mars on Aug 6, 2012. Ten minutes \nprior to arrival at the atmospheric entry interface, the MSL \nentry vehicle separated from the cruise stage.  Major nelements of the entry vehicle include the 900-kg Curiosity \nrover, a powered descent stage, a heat shield and an \naeroshell.   \nDue to the large number of new technologies and first-of-a-\nkind activities during EDL, the Mars Exploration Program \nplaced an extremely high priority on capturing tracking and \ntelemetry information from MSL during this critical mission \nphase.  A combination of X-band direct-to-Earth \ncommunications and UHF relay communications to all three \nMars orbiters was employed to maximize the information \nacquired and provide redundant communication paths.   \nOn the X-band DTE link, MSL transmitted very low-rate \ninformation via its low-gain antenna.  These data were \nreceived by the 70m Canberra Deep Space Network \nantenna. The transmission used a multiple frequency shift \nkeying \(MFSK semaphores”, transmitting a carrier along with one of \n256 subcarrier frequencies, thereby conveying 8 bits of \ninformation during each symbol, with a typical symbol \nperiod of 10 s.  The resulting signal thus provided roughly a \n1 bps effective information rate, while also providing \nadditional diagnostic data based on the amplitude and \nfrequency of the carrier.  Unfortunately the X-band signal \npath was only available until approximately 2 minutes prior \nto landing, when Mars occulted the signal path \(i.e., Earth \nset below the Mars horizon as viewed from the entry \nvehicle their visibility of the EDL trajectory and allow \nreceipt of MSL’s UHF signal.  The relay strategy for MSL nEDL had strong heritage to the successful EDL \ncommunications conducted for the Phoenix Lander mission \nin 2008 [12].  Figure 3 illustrates the MSL arrival geometry \nat Mars, along with the orbits and positions of ODY, MRO, \nand MEX. Each orbiter was configured to leverage the \nunique capabilities of its relay payload Throughout EDL, \nMSL transmitted telemetry at a data rate of 8 kbps.  ODY \nemployed its “bent-pipe mode”, in which its UHF \ntransceiver was configured to receive and demodulate \nMSL’s telemetry signal, and then immediately downlink \nthat data to Earth on ODY’s X-band link, This provided \n“real-time” visibility of MSL’s 


engineering telemetry \(aside \nfrom the Earth-Mars signal propagation time of nearly 14 \nmin Doppler shift and low signal strength \nof the MSL signal received by ODY early in EDL, the ODY \nlink was not expected to acquire until roughly 2 min after \natmospheric entry.  Geometric visibility on the MSL-ODY \nlink continued until roughly 7 min after landing.   \nIn contrast to ODY, MRO was configured to acquire an nopen-loop recording of the MSL signal throughout EDL \nuntil the end of geometric visibility, roughly 6 min after \nlanding.  This product was then downlinked to Earth after \nEDL was complete, where ground post-processing \nreconstructed the spectrum of the received MSL UHF signal \nand subsequently demodulated the signal to recover the \nMSL telemetry stream. \nFinally, MEX was configured to acquire an independent \nopen-loop recording of the MSL UHF.  As noted earlier, \nMEX’s Melacom UHF Transceiver open-loop recording \nfunction only acquired 1 bit per sample.  This supported \nrecovery of the spectrum of the sampled signal, including \nthe time history of the carrier frequency and amplitude, but \ndid not allow full demodulation of the MSL telemetry nstream. MEX was in view of MSL throughout most of EDL, \nbut set below the horizon roughly 1 min prior to landing. \n \nFigure 3:  MSL EDL geometry \n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 6 \nFigure 4 summarizes the overall EDL communication \nstrategy and timeline of key events.  Actual performance of \nthe various links was excellent.  X-band DTE “semaphore” \ntones provided visibility into the hypersonic phase of EDL, \nduring a period when plasma build-up around the entry \nvehicle caused a blackout, as predicted, of the longer nwavelength UHF links.  ODY returned 5.5 Mb of MSL \ntelemetry via its bent-pipe path during EDL, providing real-\ntime visibility into the progress of MSL EDL.  MRO’s open \nloop recording was successfully acquired, and the resulting \nlarge 7.3 Gb data product was downlinked to Earth, with \npost-processing to recover the MSL signal spectrum \ncompleted ~5 hrs after landing, and full demodulation of the \nMSL telemetry completed ~12 hrs after landing, consistent \nwith plans.  The smaller MEX 1-bit-per-sample open-loop \nrecording was downlinked and processed on the ground, \nwith the reconstructed MSL signal spectrum available \nroughly 2½ hrs after landing.  A more detailed discussion of \nthe EDL communications strategy and performance can be \nfound in references [13] and [14].  \n \n4. SURFACE RELAY SUPPORT \nLess than two hours after landing, ODY once again passed \nover the Gale Crater landing site after completing an orbit of \nMars, shortly before 5 PM LMST.  For this pass, ODY was \nconfigured to hail Curiosity and establish a full-duplex, \nreliable Prox-1 link at data rates of 8 kbps on both the \nforward and return links.  The low return link data rate \nensured large telecommunication link margin and would \nhave provided optimal data return if the rover had been in \nsafe mode.  Over 5 Mb of data were returned during this \nfirst surface pass, providing confirmation of Curiosity’s safe \nlanding and nominal rover status, as well as initial low-\nresolution images of the landing site. \nDuring Curiosity’s first Martian night, at roughly 3-4 AM \nLMST on Sol 1, MRO and ODY each provided contact nopportunities, with return link rates of 32 kbps.  \(Note that \nby MSL convention, the landing sol itself is designated Sol \n0 Curiosity’s first sunrise. \nBeginning later on Sol 1, Curiosity began the standard \ncadence of communications that supports the mission’s \nnominal surface operations concept.  At ~10 AM LMST \neach sol, an X-band uplink session supports prompt delivery \nof commands to the rover via NASA’s Deep Space \nNetwork.  These commands provide Curiosity with the \nsequence of activities to carry out during that sol, with the \nbulk of activities conducted mid-day based on illumination \nand thermal considerations.  Then, during the mid- to late-\nafternoon, Curiosity will typically have one or more relay \ncontact opportunities, with MRO at ~3 PM LMST, and \nODY at ~4 PM LMST.  These relay passes provide time-\ncritical information on the status of the rover at the end of \nits working day, information which is used during the \n \nFigure 4:  Overview of EDL telecommunications coverage via Direct-to-Earth and Relay paths \n \n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 7 \nMartian night by the rover engineering and science teams to \nplan the next sol’s activities.  Additional relay pass \nopportunities during the Martian night, at ~3 AM LMST for \nMRO and ~4 AM LMST for ODY, provide windows for \nreturning additional non-time-critical data from Curiosity.  \nThis completes the daily operations cycle, which begins \nagain after sunrise with the next sol’s X-band uplink \nsession. \nThe MSL project established requirements on relay link \nperformance consistent with Curiosity’s surface operations \nand the anticipated orbiter capabilities.  In particular, MSL \ndesigned its mission to return an average of 75 Mb/sol via \nODY and 250 Mb/sol via MRO, reflecting the higher \nperformance potential of the MRO Electra UHF nTransceiver.  Both of these data volumes assume that MSL \nselects the best AM and best PM pass for each orbiter, and \nassume a local 10 deg elevation mask at the rover site.   \nBased on ongoing support by ODY to the Opportunity \nrover, there was relatively high confidence in meeting the \nMSL-ODY data volume requirement However, there was \ngreater uncertainty in meeting the higher MSL-MRO data \nvolume, as achieving this higher level required successful \nuse of a variety of new capabilities on the MSL-MRO link, \nenabled by their 


Electra-Lite and Electra UHF transceivers.   \nA particular concern was related to the known \nElectromagnetic Interference \(EMI can degrade UHF link performance.  Based on the \nfrequency-agility of the Electra and Electra-Lite ntransceivers, it was planned to operate the MSL-MRO return \nlink at 391 MHz to mitigate the effects of a large spurious \ntone generated by MRO’s CRISM instrument at 400 MHz.  \n\(All prior MRO relay support has used a return link \nfrequency of 401.585625 MHz, the fixed frequency of the \nCE-505 UHF radios on MER and Phoenix In-flight tests \nin 2011 and early 2012 indicated that the MRO EMI might \ndegrade MSL-MRO link performance to a level that would \nthreaten meeting the 250 Mb/sol requirement, but \nsignificant uncertainty remained due to the inherent \nlimitations of those tests.   \nTo account for this uncertainty, an MSL Relay Link nCharacterization Plan \(MRLCP ncapabilities on the MSL-MRO link while at the same time \nquantitatively assessing the impact of EMI as a function of \nMRO spacecraft instrument configuration.  The MRLCP \nincluded four phases, intended to balance the need to \nintroduce new capabilities and characterize the EMI impacts \nof each MRO instrument against the need to minimize the \nrisk to the PM relay passes, which provide the time-critical \ndata needed for planning the subsequent sol’s activity, while \ncompleting the plan expeditiously in order to return MRO to \nfull science operations: \n• Phase 1:  During the initial relay passes, both the \nODY and MRO links were operated nconservatively, at only up to 32 kbps return link \ndata rate, providing substantial link margin to \nmaximize the probability of successful data \ntransfer.  During this phase MRO operated at the \nsame frequency channel 401.585625 MHz residual carrier relay \nsupport to Opportunity.  All instruments except \nHiRISE were powered off during this phase in \norder to establish a low-EMI performance baseline.  \n\(Pre-launch and in-flight tests have not shown any \nmeasurable EMI issues with HiRISE use of \ndata rates up to 256 kbps, again using operational \nconfigurations that had been previously ndemonstrated by MRO during Opportunity passes.  \nAll MRO instruments except HiRISE remained \npowered off in this phase. \n• Phase 3:  After a minimum of two successful \npasses in Phase 2, MSL entered Phase 3, in which nnew capabilities on the MRO link were introduced.  \nPasses were configured for the first time on the 391 \nMHz frequency channel supported by Electra and \nElectra-Lite, with suppressed-carrier modulation \nTable 3 Curiosity data return metrics through Sol 90 \n \n \nFigure 5:  Data volume per pass vs. elevation angle, \nas a function of which MRO science instruments are \npowered on \(HiRISE, CTX, MARCI, MCS, and \nCRISM 978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 8 \nand data rates up to 2048 kbps.  These new \ncapabilities were always exercised for the first time \non AM relay passes, to minimize risk to the time-\ncritical PM relay passes needed for next-sol rover \nplanning.  Individual data rates were selected based \non a priori link analysis, and all data rates between \n32 kbps and 2048 kbps \(in powers of 2 of this phase, the \nAdaptive Data Rate capability was exercised for \nthe first time on the MSL-MRO link, with ADR \nconfigured to initially establish the link at 32 kbps \nand then use the measured return link signal-to-\nnoise ratio to direct lander data rate changes \nthroughout the pass, in order to maximize data nreturn.  All MRO instruments except HiRISE \nremained powered off during this phase. \n• Finally, in Phase 4 the various MRO science \ninstruments were powered on sequentially.  The \nphase began with powering on of MRO’s CTX and \nMARCI instruments, which were not believed to \nbe the largest EMI emitters, followed by MCS and nfinally, CRISM.  In each configuration, data were \nacquired over a full 5-day cycle during which the ngeometry of the MRO overflights varied over a full \nrange of maximum elevation angles.   \n In practice, Phase 1 and Phase 2 each lasted only a single \nsol, as observed pass performance appeared nominal.  Phase \n3 lasted from Sol 3 through Sol 26, during which time fixed \ndata rates as high as 2048 were successfully demonstrated nThe first use of Electra’s ADR capability occurred on Sol \n18, with a single pass with a relatively modest maximum \nelevation angle of 36 deg returning 479 Mb of data, by far \nthe largest single-pass data volume ever achieved at Mars to \nthat point in time.  Since then, data returns of over 550 Mb \nhave been achieved on individual ADR passes. As a note, \nthe conservative approach of only introducing new \ncapability on the AM MSL-MRO passes ensured that all of \nthe PM passes successfully delivered data to support time-\ncritical planning activities. \nDuring Phase 4, which was carried out from Sol 27 through \nSol 62, some reduction in per-pass data volume was \nobserved after powering on CTX and MARCI, with only \nminor additional degradation after powering on MCS and \nCRISM.

Based on all testing to date, SHARAD is not expected \nto contribute any appreciable level of EMI A total of 339 passes had been completed by that \ndate, with over 45 Gb of aggregate data return.  An average nof 509 Mb per sol of data were returned during this period, \nwith 157 Mb/sol via ODY and 353 Mb/sol via MRO If we \nlimit the statistics to passes for which all of the MRO \ninstruments \(except SHARAD and ADR \nwas being used routinely, the data return via MRO averaged \n386 Mb/sol.  Figure 6 illustrates the per-sol data return \nmetrics for passes via MRO and ODY.  One can clearly \nobserve the strong 5-sol modulation in MRO performance \ndue to variations in the overflight geometries.  Based on the \nsuccessful relay performance, well in excess of Curiosity’s \naverage per-sol data return requirements, the decision was \nmade on Sol 65 to continue operations in this MRO mode \nwith all science instruments powered on. \nTo provide additional robustness in the Curiosity surface \nrelay plan, MEX was prepared to provide backup relay \nsupport in the event that ODY and/or MRO became \nunavailable for some period of time.  Prior to landing, JPL \nand QinetiQ conducted ground tests to verify the \ninteroperability of MSL’s Electra-Lite and MEX’s Melacom \nUHF transceivers.  During the first 90 sols, four \ndemonstration relay passes were performed with Curiosity \nand MEX to confirm this capability, as summarized in Table \n4.  These passes confirmed return link performance at rates \nup to 128 kbps, as well as the capability to deliver MSL \ncommand products on the MEX forward link n5. PRELIMINARY LESSONS LEARNED \nAlthough we are relatively early in the MSL surface \nmission, there are already a number of preliminary lessons \nlearned, both in terms of things that have worked well and \nareas where improvements can be made for the future.  \nThese build upon, and in some cases reinforce, previous nexperiences in relay support to the Mars Exploration Rovers \nand the Phoenix Lander missions [15,16 nSoftware Defined Radios:  The MSL-MRO link is providing \nunprecedented levels of data return from the Martian nsurface, based on the advanced functionality of the Electra \nand Electra-Lite radios on the two spacecraft These \nsoftware-defined radios are able to implement more capable \nand more flexible signal processing algorithms, including \nsupport for higher data rates, multiple modulation types, \nfrequency-agility, and adaptive data rates.  The fact that the \nADR algorithm was delivered to MRO post-launch is a \ngraphic illustration of the benefits of a software-defined \nradio architecture, which is particularly well-suited to a nlong-lived relay infrastructure orbiter, enabling evolution of \ncapability and infusion of new software/firmware \nalgorithms over the life of the mission.  Having said this, we \nalso observe that the increased Electra capability comes at \nthe cost of increased complexity and increased number of \noperational parameters and configurations, which can \nimpact testing schedule and cost.  As we gain experience \nwith the new Electra operational modes, it will be important \nto establish a core set of recommended operational nconfigurations, hiding configuration details from the user \nwhere possible. \nOperational Readiness Testing Thorough operational \nreadiness tests \(ORTs processes involved in successful relay \noperations.  These ORTs, which included participation by \nthe MSL ODY, and MRO project teams, were effective in \nuncovering a number of design anomalies and process \nissues allowing them to be resolved prior to MSL arrival at \nMars.  All future missions incorporating relay operations \nshould plan a full set of ORTs, including nominal and off-\nnominal operational scenarios, executed as early in the \nproject life cycle as practical. \nMaROS:  The Mars Relay Operations Service \(MaROS proved to be very effective in providing a central \ndatabase of a priori planning and a posteriori performance ninformation for all the orbiters and landers engaged in relay \noperations.  However, early ORTs revealed that the lander \nTable 4:  MSL-MEX demonstration passes conducted during the first 90 sols  \nSol Pass ID Pass Configuration Result \n13 MEX_MSL_2012_232_02 8k forward link/8k return link Successful  \n•  7 Mb returned \n24 MEX_MSL_2012_244_01 8k forward link/128k return link \n\(Includes MSL command product returned \n•  MSL command product delivered \n30 MEX_MSL_2012_250_01 8k forward link/128k return link Successful n•  110 Mb returned \n59 MEX_MSL_2012_280_01 8k forward link/128k return link Successful  \n• 105 Mb returned \n n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 10 \nmission personnel - MSL in this case - required more nthorough training to fully master the MaROS user interface.  \nA contributing factor here was the large amount of new \nMaROS functionality that was implemented and used for \nthe first time for MSL relay support.  To address this, \nspecific MaROS training was implemented after the ORTs, \nprior to MSL arrival at Mars, and will be a standard part of \nfuture lander mission preparations.  In addition, the next \ndelivery of MaROS will introduce new features aimed at \nimproved operability, and the MaROS customer working \ngroup will be surveyed for longer-term potential updates \nthat could further simplify operations. \nEnd-to-End Information System Compatibility of the \norbiter and lander relay transceivers is a necessary but not \nsufficient condition for end-to-end relay data flow.  In \nparticular, on MSL there were several idiosyncrasies in the \ninterface 


between the MSL flight computer and the Electra-\nLite UHF Transceiver that resulted in constraints on nallowable command data product size and development of a \ncomplex buffer management system to avoid truncating \ndownlink frames.  While operational workarounds were \nultimately identified, these idiosyncrasies resulted in more \ncomplex ground processes and delayed other critical relay \ntests.  Future missions should ensure early and thorough \ndocumentation and validation of the end-to-end relay data \npath. \nVerification Validation \(V&V including during the cruise phase of the mission.  \nWhile these were addressed prior to arrival at Mars, and nactual surface operations have proceeded smoothly, it would \nhave been desirable to identify these issues earlier.  The \nchallenge here, which is common to the previous \nexperiences with MER and PHX, is that the testing timeline \nis dictated by the lander mission’s V&V test program and \ntestbed accessibility.  The Mars Exploration Program may \nneed to establish more formal guidelines for the scope and \nschedule of testing related to verification and validation of \nrelay services, and ensure that all missions develop their test nschedules and corresponding resource profiles to meet those \nguidelines. \nEnd-to-End Relay Testbeds:  The fidelity of the end-to-end \ntestbeds for relay system testing can play a significant role \nin the overall success of the V&V test campaign.  For the \nMSL-MRO link, both the orbiter and lander projects had \nhigh fidelity spacecraft testbeds resident at JPL, with \nEngineering Models of the Electra and Electra-Lite ntransceivers, and with flight-like representations of the \nspacecraft Command & Data Handling \(C&DH subsystem.  \nWhile these testbeds were located at separate sites within \nthe JPL campus, fiber optic links supported signal flow \nbetween them, as well as integration of a high-fidelity link \nchannel simulator capable of emulating realistic time \nvariation of link amplitude, frequency, and delay, enabling \nthorough end-to-end data flow testing over a range of flight-\nlike signal conditions.  For ODY and MEX, however, each \norbiter project had only a portable test set available at JPL to \nsupport cross-project testing with MSL, each with a flight-\nlike UHF transceiver but with lower fidelity representations \nof the orbiter C&DH.  This limited the scope of ground \ntesting possible on the MSL-ODY and MSL-MEX links.  \nThis, combined with some non-flight-like aspects of the \nODY test set that were discovered late in the V&V test \ncampaign, resulted in the deferral of full validation and use \nof the MSL-ODY forward link capability until well after \nlanding.  The conclusions here are that high-fidelity testbeds \nincrease the robustness of end-to-end relay testing; when \nprogrammatic considerations limit the test hardware fidelity, \nit is essential to clearly document and assess any non-flight-\nlike aspects of the testbed infrastructure. \nElectromagnetic Interference:  Uncertainty in the MRO nEMI environment resulted in significant concern prior to \nMSL arrival as to whether Curiosity would be able to \nachieve the desired 250 Mb/sol data return via the MRO \nrelay path.  This resulted in a large amount of MRO flight \nand ground testing to attempt to better quantify the EMI \nimpacts as a function of Electra return link frequency.  It \nalso drove the need for a lengthy commissioning phase \nduring the first few months of MSL surface operations, to \ncarefully monitor performance as each MRO science \ninstrument was powered on Electra’s frequency-agility \nturned out to be an important tool in mitigating the EMI \nimpacts.  In hindsight earlier and more thorough flight \ntesting could have provided more confidence in the \npredicted MRO relay performance; however, such testing \nwould have required interruption of ongoing MRO science \nobservations Ultimately, future missions will want to \naddress EMI issues earlier in the spacecraft/instrument \ndevelopment cycle to identify and mitigate any spurious \nemissions prior to launch. \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nNASA’s ODY and MRO orbiters and ESA’s MEX orbiter \nembody an international network of Mars relay orbiters, \nproviding essential telecommunication services to the Mars \nScience Laboratory mission.  All three orbiters provided ncomplementary coverage of MSL’s EDL, acquiring tracking \nand telemetry data from MSL’s UHF transmission that ncould have provided essential information for fault \nreconstruction had a mission-ending anomaly occurred nduring EDL.  Since landing, ODY and MRO are providing \nthe highest levels of data return yet achieved for a Mars \nlander, with over 45 Gb of Curiosity data returned over the \nfirst 90 sols of the surface mission.  Key to this level of \nperformance are a number of new capabilities in the Electra \nand Electra-Lite UHF Transceivers on MRO and MSL, \nrespectively, including higher data rates, frequency-agile \noperations, and adaptive data rates, as well as the dedication \nof the operations teams on each mission and the MaROS nmultimission relay operations tools and processes \nsupporting them. \n \n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 11 \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe research described in this paper was carried out at the \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of \nTechnology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration. \nREFERENCES  \n [1] Charles D.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
