  1 Entropy Constrained Clustering Algorithm Guided by Differential Evolution Alexandre Guillaume, Seungwon Lee, Amy Braverman and Richard Terrile Jet Propulsion Laboratory 4800 Oak Grove drive Pasadena, CA  91109-8099 818-393-6899 Alexandre.Guillaume@jpl.nasa.gov  Abstract Entropy constrained vector quantization \(ECVQ is a clustering techni t h at has been successful l y  used to describe efficiently large amounts of data collected by the NASA Earth Observing System. The manipulation of this algorithm requires the user to set two parameters: the entropy Lagrange multiplier, and the initial guess for the number of clusters. In this work, we describe an integrated 
solution that uses a differential evolution algorithm to determine these two parameters. By optimizing two objective functions, entropy and distortion, we find that the solution that best describes the data is located at the inflection point in the Pareto front, i.e. at the point where the tradeoff between the two competing objectives does not favor either one 12   T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  E NTROPY

Level 3 satellite data products. Earth-orbiting satellites routinely produce massive data sets containing measurements of various characteristics of the Earth’s atmosphere, biosphere, oceans and cryosphere. Such data sets are one of the best ways to capture observational information that is crucial to the study of climate, but only if the information contained in these data can be condensed 1  1 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25 00 ©2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1286, Version 4, Updated October 23, 2007 into an understandable and usable picture of the Earth’s systems. Level 3 data products are intended for this purpose: to summarize vast quantities of data produced at 
high-resolution in a way that can be ingested into models and compared against their output   Traditional Level 3 data products summarize satellite data by sorting them into space-time bins defined by say, a monthly, one-degree latitude-longitude spatial grid, and providing the means and standard deviations of parameters in each grid cell. Braverman et al  proposed a new approach in which the multivariate distributions of such parameters are provided for each grid box thereby capturing more information about the relationships among parameters Their method is based on a modified version of the Entropyconstrained Vector Quantization \(ECVQ\algorithm originally suggested by Chou, Lookabaugh and Gray   ECVQ can be seen as a penali 
zed clustering algorithm that balances the trade-off between the information-theoretic complexity and the fidelity of a clustering of a data set. The clustering” assigns each raw data point to one of  a number of groups, and records  the group centroid and number of observations in the group. The set of centroids and their associated \(normalized\bers of cluster members constitute an estimate of the empirical distribution of the raw data   This method has been implemented to summarize a number of different remote sens ing data sets including data from NASA’s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder \(AIRS instrument, and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project \(ISCCP\he 
drawbacks to the method as currently implemented is the ad-hoc way in which two of the ECVQ algorithm parameters are set. These are the upper bound on the final number of clusters \(K\he so-called rate-distortion paramater  which determines the way entropy \(a measure of information-theoretic complexity\distortion a measure of fidelity\ed off.  In this paper we describe a method that automates the selection of these two parameters  


  2 2  E NTROPY C ONSTRAINED V ECTOR Q UANTIZATION   ECVQ In this section, we describe briefly the Entropy-constrained Vector Quantization introduced by P. A. Chou et al    The main idea is to represent a set x of N points by a smaller set of points y Each data point x is associated with a representative point y i  called a cluster, or centroid with a certain probability. Tw o quantities are introduced to evaluate the quality of the clustering. The first one is the distortion D\(x,y between the original data points x and its representative points. Intu itively, a good solution will minimize this distortion. Here the distortion is evaluated using the squared Euclidian distance D  x  y   x i  y i  i  2  The second quantity is the information entropy, also called in this case index entropy. It is defined as H  p  i log 2 p  i  i  I   where p\(i is the proportion of data points x assigned to y i  and I is the set of all the clusters indices. Intuitively, the entropy will increase with the number of clusters and the distortion decreases. A tradeoff between the minimization of the distortion and the minimization of the entropy has to be made in order to find a good solution. To this end, P. A Chou et al introduced a loss function that balances the two competing criteria J  x  y   D  x  y     H  x  y   The resemblance between this loss function and Helmoltz free energy used in Physics is misleading. The plus sign in the above equation indicates th at to reach a minimum loss both the distortion and the entropy should be minimized whereas the minimum free ener gy is reached when the entropy is maximum. It’s worth mentioning that there are other algorithms that use the framework of Physics to derive clustering algorithms, such as Deterministic Annealing DA\[4 DA, wh ich is a d e term in istic o p tim izatio n  algorithm, includes ECVQ as a specific case To initialize the ECVQ algorithm the following quantities are required: a\urce probability distribution, b\ a distortion measure, c\range multiplier  d convergence threshold, e\ndex set I and f\ initial set of clusters and entropies. He re we simply associate a 1/N  probability with each point \(N is the number of data points We use the squared Euclidian distance \(ref eq. 1\as our distortion measure The ECVQ main loop consists of the three successive steps 1  Fixing the number and size of clusters, search for the association between the data points x and the members of I that minimizes the loss function J  2  With the association found in the preceding step e.g with fixed probabilities \(associating each data point to an index uate the entropy for each index 3  With the entropies found in the preceding step fixed \(per index e centroid for each index that minimizes the loss function, e.g. the distortion since the entropy is fixed in this step After this last step, the loss function J is updated. A stopping condition then checks whether the new loss function differs from the preced ing one by more than the convergence threshold The idea behind ECVQ is easily understood from steps 3 Up to that point in the description, the algorithm does not adjust \(find\he number of clusters; it merely finds the best association between data points and a pre-set number of clusters. A strategy to find the number of cluster that approximate the data best would then be to iterate the ECVQ algorithm for different choices of initial clusters and search among the different solutions for the best solution according to a given some criterion \(such as minimum distortion\Moreover, the solution achieved with ECVQ is valid for one Lagrange multiplier  which implies that multiple solutions correspond to multiple choices of  In their original paper, Chou et al proposed a method to explore the parameter space of Lagrange multipliers, thus defining the convex hull or line of solutions in the graph D\(H However even with this systematic method, the question of the quality of the solution and the criterion to gauge this quality still remain. In other words, which solution on the convex hull does the best job of describing the data Amy Braverman et al proposed a solution tailored specially for data collected for the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder AIRS  The prot ocol for set t i ng  there is to first stratify the data in geographic and temporal bins \(e.g. one degree latitude by one degree longitude by day\, apply ECVQ with the same value of  to all bins. This procedure is performed for multiple values  and the value for which the variance of the distortions across all bins is minimized is selected. The reasoning is that the algorithm should treat the data homogenously across different bins so that differences in the output should only stem from real differences in the data and not from differences in the quality of the clustering that results 


  3 We propose a method that addresses both the general question raised above concerning the choice of specific solutions \(among all the solutions provided by the ECVQ algorithm in the D\(H plane\he dependence of the solutions on two algorithm parameters \(the Lagrange multiplier  and the initial number of clusters\In order to solve this problem, we decided to generate our own training data sets. Using several Gaussi an distributions, we could set the dimensionality \(number of distributions\e number of clusters, the localization \(the mean of each Gaussian\the spread \(the Gaussian varian ce\overlap between groups of points. This prior knowledge was instrumental in devising a criterion to choose a solution We use differential evolution \(DE t o fi nd t h e opt i m um  solutions to this problem. Such evolutionary computation techniques are known to be well suited for multi-objective optimization problems. ECVQ is equivalent to a biobjective optimization problem reduced to a single objective one: instead of minimizing the distortion and the entropy separately, a single function equal to a weighted sum of the objectives, a single loss function, is minimized Beside the obvious dependence on the Lagrange multiplier  the ECVQ solutions also depend on the number of clusters used to initialize the algorithm. Since  is a real number and the initial number of clusters is an integer, so DE is an especially appropria te choice because of the ease of implementing a mixed variables algorithm with this technique 3  D IFFERENTIAL E VOLUTION   DE Differential evolution is a stochastic optimization technique put forth in 1995 by Rainer Storn and Kenneth Price   It  belongs to the category of Evolutionary Algorithms \(EAs which means that it is a population based algorithm: an initial population of potential solutions is formed by creating individuals randomly within the problem bounds and after an iterative process of modification and selection  of individuals, the population contains individuals that converge toward the problem’s optimal solutions A specific mutation operation is at the heart of DE. In other EAs, the mutation usually consists in adding a small increment chosen from a Ga ussian distribution to a randomly selected individual. In DE, the difference between two distinct individuals randomly chosen from the population is formed and added with a scale factor F to a third distinct individual also chosen randomly and distinct from the two other ones. The individual resulting from this differentiation process, analogous to the mutation in classical genetic algorithm, is called the trial vector Subsequently, this vector undergoes a crossover depending on whether a random number is smaller than a crossover rate Cr It is also customary to add another condition for the crossover to guarantee that at least one of the genes will be changed. The trial vector b ecomes the target vector if another random number chos en between one and the number of genes is equal to the gene number considered while going through all the genes of an individual\. Finally the objective function is evaluated using the resulting trial vector and compared to th e individual of the preceding generation. If it dominates the solution from the preceding generation, the trial vector becomes the new individual for this rank \(the index of the individual in the population This procedure is repeated N pop times N pop being the population size. This DE strategy is also known as DE/rand/1/bin \(“rand” means that the base vectors are chosen randomly and “bin” standing for binomial and 1 for uniform crossover We use a straightforward m odification of the classical differential evolution algorithm to incorporate multiple objectives: the trial vector is selected if it dominates the target vector for all objectives. At the last generation all dominated solutions are removed. In the literature, this version is referred to as Gene ralized Differential Evolution GDE   4  R ESULTS  We generated a training set from a mixture of ten twodimensional Gaussian distributions. Their exact characteristics are unimportant here and only the relative changes between two training sets will be indicated. The set contains 1000 points. We used an algorithm that ran for 6 generations with a population of 100 individuals. The crossover Cr constant was set to 0.6 and the differentiation constant F to 0.9. We allowed the Lagrange multiplier  to vary between 0 and 2.2 and the initial number of clusters K between 1 and 1000 e.g the number of points. The population at the last generation contained 24 nondominated individuals. Since these results are unevenly spaced in the   K plane, we use a linear interpolation to generate a regular grid and represent the result in Figure 1 as a contour plot. The color scale shows the magnitude of either the entropy \(bottom\ or the distortion \(top\e also show the solutions with the true number of clusters \(ten and represent them with red points on the same figure 


  4  Figure 1: Contour plot the entropy \(bottom\the distortion \(top\on of the Lagrange multiplier   and the initial number of clusters K  The first conclusion drawn from Figure 1 is that the entropy and the distortion are indeed opposite objectives: entropy maxima correspond roughly to distortion minima. The second conclusion is that the placement of the solution indicat ed by the red dots doesn’t seem to obey any trend other than the simultaneous minimization of both the entropy and the distortion. The presence of one red point outside of the distortion contour plot is an artifact of the interpolation; there are not enough points in this region to interpolate To further our understanding of the results, we introduce another representation. The so-called Pareto front is a useful concept \(and repres entation degree of correlation \(conflict\ between different objectives The set of solutions to a problem with multiple objectives can include solutions that are dominated by others. A solution dominates a second one if it, at least, dominates for all objectives and dominates strictly, for at least one objective. The Pareto front is obtained when all the dominated solutions have been removed The Pareto front for the ECVQ problem is depicted on Figure 2. The shape of the curve D\(H indicates clearly the antagonism between the two objectives. Even though there is no obvious systematic evolution of the pair of parameters   K  ere is a systematic evolution of the final number of clusters on the plot. It increases steadily w ith the entropy. We also plot in red point on Figure 2 the solutions containing ten clusters These are located at the inflec tion point of the Pareto front We observe this trend for different data training sets. Hence we propose to use this feature as a criterion to choose the best solutions when working on a realistic set of data, e.g with unknown a priori number of clusters. However intuitive, the inflexion is not an easy quantity to calculate in the context we are considering. First, the density of points in the Pareto front might be uneven \(which is the case in Figure 2\herefore the derivative might be hard to compute. Secondly, for a typical Pareto front as the one sketched on Figure 2, the derivative does not permit to single out a specific point. Th erefore, for all practical purposes, we propose the following method to select a solution we choose the solution in the Pareto front for which the distance to the line joining the two points H\(D=0 and D\(H=0\, is maximal   Figure 2: Pareto front \(in blue The red point indicates the solutions with 10 clusters The black line joins the two points H\(D=0 and D\(H=0  A magenta point indicates the solution corresponding to the largest distance between the black line and the Pareto front  This method is simple. The calculation of both points needed for the line is st raightforward. For instance the entropy when the distortion is zero is simply the logarithm of the number of data points lo g 2  N  In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to the solution selected by our method as the inflexion point. The implementation of the ECVQ algorithm we use, calculates the distortion in normalized units in order to compare the distortion of the different dimensions. At the end of this article, we will give an example where the two dimensions will be of a different nature 


  5                                        For clarity purposes, we decided to normalize both the maximum distortion and entropy to one for all the Pareto fronts shown in this paper \(dividing the maximum distortion by two and the maximum entropy by log 2  N  This guarantees that the scale ra tio is one and therefore that the line joining the point chosen with our method to the line joining the points D\(H=0\ and H\(D=0\, will be perpendicular. On Figure 2, the solution found with our method is indicated by a magenta dot and is distinct from the solutions that contain the true number of clusters \(ten This difference could seem like a flaw of our method, but we will show that it is not. For this purpose, we represent on Figure 3 four synthetic data sets along with the corresponding solution. Theoretically, all points on the Pareto front are equally good. However as a visual examination of Figure 3 reveals, there are obvious qualitative differences if one makes the extra assumption of the existence of a best compro mise. In Figure 3, the plot labeled a\ows the solution with the highest entropy in the last population. With a total of 69 clusters \(in red the ten clusters is represented by several red points indicating an insufficient compression. On the other hand the solution with the highest distortion, shown in plot b has only one cluster. These two extreme cases support our claim that there are better solutions than these along the Pareto front. Note however that one cannot extend this claim to the limit where a unique solution would be better than all the other ones. Indeed, the program found two solutions with 10 clusters. The solution found by the method we propose in this paper, is shown in Figure 3 plot d\s solution has seven cl usters located at the exact location of the well-separated clusters. Two pairs of overlapping blue clusters are represented each by one red cluster each To further test our approach, we generated four sets of data that differed only in their spread \(e.g. variance since we are using Gaussian distributions\ncreased spread should increase the distortion per cluster. All other Figure 3: The data training set is represented with blue points. Clusters are represented with red points. Plot a corresponds to the right most solution on Figure 2 with the highest entropy and the lowest distortion. Plots b corresponds to the left most solution on Figure 2, with th e highest distortion and the lowest entropy \(null c s which are represented by a red dot and a magenta dot respectively on Figure 2 a  b  c  d   


  6 things being equal, the distortion when the entropy is zero should increase as well, when the spread increases                    In other words, for the same number of data points, the point H\(D=0 should remain the same while the point D\(H=0 should move to higher values as the spread increase. We increase the spread from the level of the data presented above to values equal or greater than the distance between clusters, level at which the notion of cluster itself is irrelevant. The results of this study are shown in Figure 4 As long as the clusters are well separated, our algorithm finds solutions close to the true locations \(synthetically generated increases the distortion of all solutions. This effect can be seen on the Pareto Fronts shown in Figure 5. After normalization, the higher distortion results in a deeper inflexion point, or higher curvature at the inflexion point Our criterion is able to find a good solution in all cases. The spread is so wide on plot d of Figure 4, that the data distribution is nearly uniform. To test this limit, we generated another set of synthetic data not shown\th a uniform distribution. The resulting Pareto front was similar to the green Pareto front shown on Figure 5. Hence, Figure 5 is an experimental illustration of our phenomenological criterion; the uniformity of the data influences the bend of the inflexion point and the distance of this point to the line joining the two points D\(H=0 and H\(D=0  Next we address the ultimate goal of this paper, finding a method to select the best pair of parameters  K 1, we list the parameters corresponding to the four runs that lead to plot a\o d\gure 4. We see that the entropy is more or less constant between r uns a\ch have the same number of clusters. Since we didn’t change the location of the clusters or the probability that a given data  Figure 4: The blue points represent generated data sets.

This technique, like the ECVQ technique does not single out a solution. In their work, the authors performed several runs and found several solutions corresponding to different numbers of clusters After a statistical analysis of the different results, they conclude that the solution with four clusters is the best They also admit that this c hoice is “somewhat subjective In a more recent work, Rossow et al 9 ad d r ess th e shortfall of the K-mean technique e.g the need for a subjective choice, by selecting the different solutions using four, rather stringent, criteria.

Rather, we want to stress with the ISCCP data illustration that our phenomenological criterion is, at least, as good as other criteria and can be automated regardless of the nature of the problem. Rossow et al improve their early “subj ective introducing four objective crite ria.

Provided with an initial guess of clusters to represent a set of data, the ECVQ minimizes two conflicting quantities, the distortion and the entropy. We used a differential evolution approach to find the best solutions among a population of randomly generated solutions. We then proposed a method to choose a unique solution by picking in the Pareto front the point with the greatest distance to a line join ing the points of zero entropy and zero distortion. This phenomenological criterion was tested and validated on different synthetic and experimental data sets.  In particular, we used data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Pr oject and found a similar number of clusters as Jakob et al   As l ong as a sufficient level of inhomogeneity justifies the clustering process, our method systematically provides a unique solution with its corresponding pair of parameters K and    R EFERENCES   Philip A.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
