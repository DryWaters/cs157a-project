In the recent years,\nthe growing interest inspired by human activity analysis\nprompts the scholars to pay more attention for algorithm\nstudying. Pavan Turage [1] provided a survey on real-\ntime video analysis. Joshua Candamo [2] focused on\nhow to understand Transit Scenes and reviewed the\nrelative algorithms for human behavior analysis in the\ncorresponding scenes. Technical progress and the rapid\ndecline in the price make more and more researchers\nexploit their research to more capturing devices for getting\nmore motion information Omar Oreifej [3] introduced the\ndepth sequences for activity recognition. A.Jalal [4] applied\ntheir proposed feature descriptors for life logging at smart\nhome. Ross B. Girshick [5] proposed general pose estimate\nframework from depth data. The superior performance on\n3D data demonstrates a potential solution to human activity\nrecognition. However, with the rapid development of big\ndata technology, ?ne motion description, such as hands\nand gesture, in the massive network data present huge\nchallenges for deep data mining and research.\nIn this paper, we focus on human ?ne motion description.\nThrough the extraction of consistently invariant feature, the\nframework of 3D hand activity recognition is established.\nFirst, a novel method for hand segmentation and tracking is\nintroduced to our framework. An effective dynamic model\nbased on graph cuts can be used for hand state prediction.\nThen, inspired by the fusion technology for RGB and\ndepth information, we consider combining the RGB and\ndepth videos for ?ne motion analysis, e.g. hand activity and\ngesture recognition. The novel feature representation, named\nas 3D Mesh MoSIFT, is developed from the original 3D\nMoSIFT feature descriptor [10] for key points detection and\nactivity description. For learning a discriminative model,\nall feature descriptors are clustered to generate a visual\ncodebook by k-means. A sparser coding method called\nsimulation orthogonal matching pursuit \(SOMP combination of codewords. Finally,\nthe new input sample can be recognized by k-nearest\nneighbor \(KNN classi?er. Experimental results based on\nChaLearn gesture dataset and our hand RGB-D activity\ndataset show that our proposed framework for hand activity\nrecognition can provide better accuracy than other classical\nalgorithms.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, we discuss the\nhand segmentation and tracking in Section 2. Then, we\nintroduce the 3D Mesh MoSIFT feature descriptor in Section\n3. In the following, the hand activity recognition framework\nbased on SOMP is proposed in Section 4. Experimental\nanalysis is described in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the\npaper.\nII. HAND SEGMENTATION AND TRACKING\nKinect camera is used to simultaneously collect the RGB\nand depth videos with the different kinds of human hands\nactivities. The ?rst step is hand segmentation based on\nthe RGB videos.

The\ncollected RGB videos need to convert into the gray data\nfor conveniently compute the descriptor. In the step of\nkey point detection density-invariant Gaussian ?lters are\nde?ned to calculate the ?ltered mesh sets on the surface\ngeometry by combined the gray and depth information\nsimultaneously, denoted as mesh octave MS =\n\(\nV S , F\n For a single frame gray-depth image\npair, consecutive octaves are subtracted to obtain the DoG\nfunction. The feature points are de?ned as the maxima in\nlocation and scale. For each vertex vsi at an octave s, the\nvertex vs+1i can be computed in the next octave as,\nvs+1i =\n1\nV nsi\n?\nvsj?V nsi\nvsj \(11 set of the ?rst-order neighbors of\nvsi , which is invariance to the distance between the vertices.\nConsidering two consecutive mesh octaves, the DoG\nfunction dsi at scale s is computed by,\ndsi =\n1\n?2S\n|vsi ? vs+1i 12 13 formulation [9], the overall ?lter\nwidth is given by ?N =\n?\nNDi. The points vsi with the\nlocal maxima both in scale and location at scales are chosen\nas the feature points.\n960\nB. 3D Mesh MoSIFT Feature Points Descriptor\nFor the detected key points, we encode both the gray and\ndepth information to describe points. The feature descriptor\nis composed of two parts: 3D gradient space and 3D\nmotion space. For 3D gradient space image gradient along\nthe horizontal and vertical directions can be calculated as\nfollows,\nIx = ?x \(I nIy = ?y \(I D D 14   gradient in x and y direction.\nFor 3D motion space, the point pt is detected at time t\nand the predicted point pt+1 can be obtained by optical ?ow\nin RGB data. Then we can con?rm the corresponding points\npdt and p\nd\nt+1 in the depth image D. The velocity in different\ndirections can be calculated by,\nVx = Ix \(pt+1 pt Iy \(pt+1 pt pt+1 pt 15 can compute the magnitude and orientation for the local\npath around the detected points in 3D surface.\nIV VISUAL CODEBOOK CONSTRUCTION AND HAND\nACTIVITY RECOGNITION\nSuppose X = [x1, x2, · · ·, xN ] ? RD×N , is a set of D-\ndimensional descriptor extracted from the training videos,\nwe construct the visual codebook B = [b1 bM ] ?\nRD×M with entries. Given X with a sparse representation\nC = [c1, c2, · · ·, cN ] , ci ? RM that means each ci contains\nk \(k  M optimization problem,\nmin\nC\n?X ?BC?2F , s.t.?ci?0 ? k, ?i \(16 l0 norm which\ncounts the number of nonzero elements [11]. Approximate\nsolution is provided by greedy algorithms or convex relax-\nation. The sparse coef?cients of the vector ci ? C associated\nwith all the descriptor of a speci?ed class thus demonstrate\nthe contribution of the entries toward the representation of\nthat class. Therefore, we use the coef?cient histogram to\ndenote the representation of each individual sample.\nThe popular bag-of-words representation is adopted to\ndescribe the discriminant features for visual codebook ob-\ntained by the histogram of occurrence of each codewords.\nSupport Vector Machine \(SVM introduced to classify the\nkey-element input vector obtained by the histogram. The\nstandard one-vs-test strategy is used to train multiple SVMs\nfor human activity learning and get the recognition results.\nTable I\nMEAN LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE SCORE BY DIFFERENT FEATURE\nDESCRIPTORS WITH DIFFERNET CODEBOOK SIZE\nMethods 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\nCuboid 0.367 0.365 0.343 0.331 0.314\nCuboid \(R+D 0.260 0.250 0.236 0.235\nStip hog \(R+D 0.291\nStip hof \(R+D R+D

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\nOur experiments are based on two RGB-D video datasets.\nThe ?rst one is the ChaLearn Gesture dataset in round 2 as\nshown in Figure 1, which contains 20 batches, each one of\nthem including 100 recorded gestures grouped in sequences\ncontaining from 1 to 5 gestures, performed by the same user\n[12]. The second one is composed of 9,100 RGB-D video\npairs, which is collected by Kinect [10]. In our experiments,\nthe performance evaluation includes the ef?ciency of the\nproposed 3D Mesh MoSIFT feature descriptor and the\ndistance sensitiveness of the activity recognition framework\nbased on the different sets to validate the generality accuracy\nand usability.\nA. Experiments with different feature descriptors\nFor all the comparison, we compute the mean Levenshtein\ndistance \(MLD insertions substitutions or deletions in Table 1, the results demonstrate that: 1 of ?ne motion recognition.

Experiments with different distances\nIn these experiments, the dataset we selected is captured\nby Kinect camera involving the single and both hand ac-\ntivities from 1 meter to 5 meters away from the camera.\nFor each distance, the test sets involves the ?ne motions by\nsingle or both hands. F1 score measures are introduced to\nevaluate the performance of our framework with the other\nclassical methods based on the different distances. The ?rst\ncolumn shows the results of the proposed framework and\nthe results of the other columns come from our previous\nwork [10]. According to the data analysis in Table 2, the\nconclusions can be obtained as follows: 1 descriptors ef?ciently integrated depth and color\ninformation improved false negative performance and elim-\ninated the impact of illumination and outlier variations. 2 different distance,\nthe F1 score has higher recognition results between 2m and\n3m, which demonstrates the descriptor is more discriminant\nat this range of distance.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we present a uni?ed framework for human\nactivity recognition and apply the notion of ?ne motion\nanalysis to hands activities and gesture recognition. An\neffective dynamic model based on graph cuts can implement\nthe accurate hand segmentation and tracking. We extended\nthe original 3D MoSIFT feature descriptor to 3D Mesh\nMoSIFT, which can fuse the depth and RGB information to\nencode the visual codebooks. SOMP is used for represent\nthe linear combination of code words for higher activity\ndiscrimination. Experimental results based on ChaLearn\ndataset and our RGB-D dataset show that our proposed\nframework is versatile for the different datasets and provide\nbetter accuracy than other classical algorithms.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe work presented in this paper was supported\nby the National Natural Science Foundation of Chi-\nna \(Grants No. NSFC-61170176 Doc-\ntoral Program of Higher Education of China \(Grants\nNo.20120005110002 Speci?c\nProject\(Grants No.2011ZX0300200301, 2012ZX03005008 Build\nTogether Project.\nREFERENCES\n[1] P.

system, these three \nvalues are always included in the projected plan instance. \nVII. LEARNING SUPPORT VECTORS AND HYPERPLANES \nWe summarize the information contained in a cluster by \nusing a hyperplane created by an SVM We are mainly \ninterested in the distances from a chosen plan to its boundary \nwith classes other than its own. Several stages are needed to \nachieve the result. First, we need to find the best way to \nrepresent the training data for use in the SVM, this includes \nnormalization. Secondly, we must analyze the problem of nfmding optimal SVM-parameters and a kernel. Finally, we \nanalyze the distances. An SVM analysis finds the hyperplane \nthat is oriented so that the margin between the support vectors \nof different classes is maximized. \nThe concept of treating the objects to be classified as points \nin a high-dimensional space and finding a line that separates \nthem is not unique to the SVM. The SVM, however, is \ndifferent from other hyperplane-based classifiers in how the \nhyperplane is chosen. If we define the distance from the \nseparating hyperplane to the nearest data point as the margin of \nthe hyperplane, then the SVM selects the maximum margin nseparating hyperplane. Selecting this hyperplane maximizes \nthe SVM's capability to calculate the correct classification of \nup to that time unseen plan instances. When representing the \nclassification boundary by the SVM optimal hyperplane, each \ndimension has a bound for the corresponding action in the plan. \nUsing the SVM decision function, each action can be evaluated \nby its presence in the tested plans presented to the decision \nfunction. This way we can correct our bad plans to be good \nplans by simply changing the bad actions. \nThe first step is to adapt the plans to the SVM machinery. \nSVM requires that each data instance is represented as a vector \nof real numbers. Let a plan contain R actions which can take \nany value representing a valid alternative for this action. We \ngenerate N number of R-dimensional vectors for training. The \nplans are clustered into different classes to be used as training \ntargets Yi' Training plans are represented by vectors \nxi = {Xi!' ""xiI}' The plan vectors xi are all normalized. \nScaling them before applying the SVM is very important. This \nis done to avoid that attributes in greater numeric ranges \ndominate those in smaller numeric ranges. \nThe basic idea of SVM is to find a function [\(x actually obtained targets Yi for \nall training data {\(xl' Yl X" y space of the input plans. \nIn the case of linear functions [, a separating hyperplane, \nwritten in terms of a weight vector wand a threshold b takes \nthe form [\(x x,w 0 dot product.

Optimal linear divider of two separate classes. \nx, \nThe support vectors lie on the boundary of the convex hulls \nof the two classes, thus they possess supporting hyperplanes. \nThe support vector optimal hyperplane is the hyperplane which \nlies in the middle of the two parallel supporting hyperplanes \n\(of the two classes ndecision function \nsign\(wx+ b 21 independent of the dimensionality of the input space \nX, and depends only on the number of support vectors nFor all points from the hyperplane HP[\(xi,w HP is b/llwll . \nThis is the distance measure used. \nU sing the kernel trick [19] we can represent the decision \nfunction in higher dimensions. The choice of kernel used in \nthis work is a Gaussian, which has a single parameter \n\(22 model parameters. Some flexibility in separating \nthe categories is needed. SVM implementations have a cost nparameter C, which controls the trade off between allowing \ntraining errors and forcing rigid margins. This parameter gives \nthe model a soft margin that permits some misclassifications \n[10]. Increasing C increases the cost of misclassification of \nplans and forces a more accurate model to be crated. A search \nis used to fmd the optimal value of C and y. \nUsing a hyperplane to separate the feature vectors into two \nclasses works when there are only two target categories, but \nhow do we handle the case where we have more than two nclasses? The two most used methods are: \(i the other \ncategories are merged and \(ii k - 1 is the number of \ncategories. In this work we use the second approach and we \nevaluate classes against each other. \nV III. IMPLEMENTATION OF SVM \nWe study an experiment of 1000 evaluated plan instances \nthat are clustered by Potts spin clustering into eleven different \nclusters based on their characteristics and outcomes. E ach \naction of the plan holds a unique integer number representing \nthe alternative performed for that action. A training matrix of \nthe 1000 different plans of length 46 is normalized with respect \nto each action. The eleven clusters are represented as classes \nwhich in turn are represented by any integer between 1 and 11. \nWe use the L1BSVM library [20] in this work. Important in \nUBSVM is the kernel function and the choice of if its \nparameters. Parameter optimization is done by a full search out \nof a pre-defmed parameter 


set Cross validation is used for \nselection of best parameters for this training set, meaning that \neach combination of parameter choices is checked using cross \nvalidation, and the parameters with best cross-validation \naccuracy are chosen. Using the selected parameters the final \nmodel is trained on the whole training set We use the optimal \nhyperplane defined by the SVM for determining the distance \nfrom any plan to the boundary of the classes for the other plans. \nSince LIBSVM only delivers output for calculating the ndistance to the support vectors, the plans nearest the \nhyperplane of each class, we use an extra class for the plan \nunder execution. This is \(by definition from any specific plan of interest \nto the hyperplane can be calculated. Most interesting is how the \ndistance for a specific plan under execution changes depending \non how many of the actions has been performed. To be able to \ncalculate this, the SVM needs to be re-trained for each new \nnumber of performed actions. \nThe primal variable w is not a direct output of L1BSVM. \nInstead we use the provided support vectors SVs and the ncoefficients for the support vectors sv _coef; \nw = SVs * sv_coef. \(23 from the trained model. It \nincludes result from every combination of all classes. We are, \nhowever, only interested in the part of b regarding class 12 of \nthe plan under execution. We need to select these by a selection \nvector for b. \nThe model is trained for twelve classes, eleven classes from \npre-calculated Potts spin clustering and one class containing \nthe plan under execution. Training is done 45 times for each ninvestigation, each training with successive longer plans, from \nplan length of 2 actions to training on the full matrix with 43 \nactions, see TABLE L \nTABLE I: Psendo code for the investigation. \nI.

USING HYPERPLANES AS DECISION SUPPORT \nSingle plans are tested against all the other plans and the \nresult is plotted in Fig 6-Fig. 11. The length of the plans is on \nthe x-axis and the distances on the y-axis. The distances from \nthe tested plan to the boundary of another class varies with the \nlength of the plan. First, the best plan is tested against all the \nother plans; the best plan is the one with lowest value of h.

CONCLUSIONS \nWe conclude that it is possible to provide decision support \nregarding the robustness of military operational plans by \nlearning boundaries from simulated and evaluated plan \ninstances from a simulation-based decision support system. \nU sing a series of computational processing steps, such as \ncalculating distances between all plans based on their \ncharacteristics and outcomes, clustering all plans with Potts \nspin neural clustering 


using those distances, performing \nevidential model screening of all actions as to their \ndifferentiating capacity between different clusters of plans, \nusing SVM to learn support vectors from clusters of screened nplan instances, and deriving hyperplanes from these support \nvectors, we provide decision support regarding the risk of \nfailure as measured by the distance from a plan during \nexecution towards the closest hyperplane nXI.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
