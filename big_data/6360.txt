Exploring Web Search Behavior Patterns to Personalize the Search Results  Walisa Romsaiyud Graduate School of Information Technology Siam University, 235 Petkasem rd Bangkok, Thailand walisa.rom@siam.edu    Wichian Premchaiswadi Graduate School of Information Technology Siam University, 235 Petkasem rd Bangkok, Thailand wichian@siam.edu     Abstract Tagging refers to the metadata that many users added in the form of keywords on photos, videos, and other resources for sharing the contents via the internet. However 
there are several difficulties with tagging that come from tag variation, tag ambiguity and flat organization. This paper presents the integration of social tagging and the collaborative web search to improve usersê or groups of usersê satisfaction in search results. The characteristics of collaborative web search enable remote collaboration among small groups of users who are working either synchronously or asynchronously on web search tasks. Our main purpose is to analyze the users behavior patterns from the search keywords obtained from the same and different groups of users. The patterns of web search behaviors are learned and used for generating the tag-based association rules. The results of analysis can be used to improve the quality of web search for a social search 
community. We designed and implemented a web application for effective use of tags to improve usersê experience on web search. The users are asked to assign weights to the web links based on the relevancy of the web content to the tag. These weights are used to re-rank the original search results so that tags that best serving a userês needs are at the top of the ranked list. When a new user performs a web search, the system will generate a personalized tagging recommendation to the user for selection Keywords-meta-tags; social tagging; collaborative web search; tag-based association rules I   I NTRODUCTION  The most popular way to access information over the internet is doing a keyword-based search via the search 
engines. However, a simple search on the internet can return huge information that causes information overload [1 situation which can adversely affect the response time of searching and processing the information. For example searching the internet using the same inquiry via different search engines may return different set of results such as Google returned 64,900,000 results, while Bing and Yahoo may return 140,000,000 and 146,000,000 respectively Apparently, a large number of search results returned often include also the hidden web contents in some web sites that perhaps contain desirable information or unnecessary information \(redundant, incorrect and meaningless 
information\. Therefore, to avoid the information overload the challenge for managing the information is to extract a semantic description from information sources,  understand the meanings behind user requests and match these semantic elements for mainly purpose in order to return the right results that meet the userês need [2    Several research communities have addressed the issues as following: Page et al., the founder of Google, developed a search algorithm called PageRank [3 th a t an aly zes l i n k s  using sophisticated text-matching techniques and shows a higher search result occurs for sites that are linked by other important sites. Then, Liu and Ma [4 re pl ac ed  t h e P a g e Ra nk and proposed the new BrowseRank algorithm for collecting 
the user behavior data in web surfing and built a user browsing graph. However, web contents refer not only to text, but also pictures, sounds and movies. Therefore, web content mining techniques has been applied in many studies such as classification web search results [5  L a j m i et  al   6   uses social networks and common sense deduction rules to adapt the description tags of the photos for the current viewer and Liu and Fang [7 opo sed a pe r s o n a l i z e d  t a g recommendation algorithm incorporating with users' social relations. Furthermore, the collaborative web search [8, 9 and 10 a s f i rs t in t r odu ce d by Mer ed ith an d H o rv i t z 9   who implemented the SearchTogether that enables people in each group to share their keywords search, query histories 
personal comments on pages and information on pages. In addition, Boydell and Smyt o s ed a nei ghbo r voting algorithm which learns tag relevance by accumulating votes from visual neighbors In this paper, we present a web-based application called Group Search & Share \(GSS\. GSS allows users to associate arbitrary tags with the resources and share tags among users via a user friendly interface. GSS supports several functions that cover the three main strategies: the first strategy is based on social tagging systems that allow individual user to add tags for storing, sharing and discovering web URLs. The tags created by participants in the same group can be used as web resources index to improve web searching. The second 
strategy is to rearrange the order of search results by the weights of their votes as search results ranking and store them into a log file. The third strategy is to develop a personalized tagging recommendation algorithm leveraging a tag preference propagation procedure based on the MCMC method The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section II presents some reviews and describes related works on collaborative web search, social tagging and collective intelligence recommendation technique to improve search

results. Section III addresses the problem statement and proposal, describes the research design and shows the results from a preliminary study. Section IV describes and discusses the results from the experiments. The final section provides a conclusion and ideas for future work II  RELATED WORKS  In this section, we will first present other works related to the collaborative web search. Second, we present the work on social tagging that can be used to improve user experience by providing a better set of resources and a ranking of search results. Third, we present the works that are making use of filtering and re-ranking web search. Finally, we present collective intelligence methods of search results that can improve users or groups of usersê satisfaction on search results The trend for web search is focusing on the Collaborative Web Search \(CWS\or social search, which refers broadly to the process of finding information online with the assistance of social resources [9  C W S is r e pr es en te d as  a g r ou p of  members who are seeking for a similar topic that they are interested in, such as: students who are working on their assignments or co-workers who are working on their projects across the internet. Group members who are having a shared goal of searching are able to effectively collaborate on web search activities [10, 12 y n e a n d Smy t h  12  de si gned  t o  operate as a form of meta-search by using a case base of past search patterns from the userês community to identify key results for promotion.  The results other searchers have clicked  a n d t h e l i nks o t her p e op l e  m a d e b e t w e e n  information resources [14 ar e  used i n  ra nki ng t h e  w e b  search results, and past group query behavior is used to suggest relevant related search keywords  o r e v e n  replace the userês existing query   T h e  e x p l o i t a t i o n  of web inquiry and search results can be found in many studies such as w h i c h e x p l o r e d t h e use o f soc i a l t a ggi ng t o  improve web searches. Ye et al. [1 p r o pos ed th e f e e d b a c k  model to select high-quality feedback terms from social annotation. The novel indexing and ranking method presented by Nakamura and Tanaka [19 s used for fi ndi ng  the target video clips on video sharing web sites for the emotional impression such as the level of happiness and sadness and so on  Figure 1  The main screenshot from Flickir web site Figure 1 illustrates the main screen of Flickr showing a list of popular tags. In Flickr, there is no content driven ranking of the results returned from searches. The results are ordered in reverse chronological order. Hotho et al proposed Adapted PageRank based on the idea that a URL which is tagged with important tags by important users becomes important itself.  In addition, Shenghua Bao et al  pr opo sed a  no v e l a l gori t h m   c a l l e d Soc i a l P a ge R a nk The idea behind the algorithm is that high quality web pages are usually popularly tagged by many up-to-date users with popular annotation Recently, Google introduced new services using mass tagging to improve their search engine. Google Co-Op allows users to contribute information that helps Google to improve search results for everyone by allowing users to tag or label URLs. This is our area of interest that we will extend beyond current works by utilizing additional metadata information to improve the resource indexing and enhance the performance of the similarity ranking  Figure 2  The search results overlapped As Figure 2 illustrates, Thumbshots Ranking web site provides a live picture of the overlap and ranking differences between any numbers of search engines. In figure 2, we defined the keyword as çThailandé and selected to search from Google and MSN. The blue color lines represent the matching results Collective Intelligence \(CI\ is currently an active field of research in making use of the web information. CI usually means the collection of data from disparate groups of people that the combining of behavior, preferences, taste, or ideas of a group of people to make suggestions about other things a user might like. For instance, one of the most beneficial areas of applying collective intelligence is marketing; when people use the internet for making purchases, doing research or seeking out VDOs.

extract relationships between program items and addressed the sparsity or maintenance problem by adopting a unique approach to recommendation ranking which combines user similarities and items similarities to provide more effective recommendation orderings. Burke [3 ap pl i e d  a  Hy b r i d  Recommendation system, which combines techniques of different types with the expectation that the strengths of one will compensate for the weakness of another The work presented in this paper is an extension of the previous works [8-11, 21, 24 n t h e f o l l o w i ng w a y s  First, in addition to the identification of social tagging for the purposes of sharing system that allows participants to share and discover tags, we now further improve our returned search results using userês target tags as index resources Second, we developed and tested a collaborative web search for group members that allows users in the group who has registered for searching together to share web search experience in the same topic. Our approach is to record history logs file from keyword search, userês tags, URLs, IP address, Hit rates, comments, filter user profiles and define roles for each user in each group \(each user can be a member in several groups such as member in co-worker group family and friend, etc.\Third, we proposed our re-ranking model based on h at used t h e s o ci a l  t a ggi ng systems to re-rank the result pages of the conventional web search engines. The findings from the experiment show that the search results obtained from the proposed method were giving deeper understanding into the meaningful of tags and relationship between tags III  P ROPOSED A PPROACH  A  Architectural Overview First, we will describe the architectural overview of the GSS system. Figure 3 illustrates the architecture overview of the proposed web application. In the concept of Collaborative Web Search, all users must register and login for searching the same topic together such as students searching information for their homework, remote discussion on research projects. The system allows users to define the keyword phrase or sentence, such as user1 entered the keyword as çJava The crawler is mainly used to create a copy of all the visited pages for later processing by a search engine that will index the downloaded pages to provide fast searches Crawlers can also be used for automating maintenance tasks on a Web site The meta-search engine fetches the data into 10 documents \(URLs\ and returns the results to each user Therefore, users can add the proper tags to the returned documents. The idea of tagging system is the collaborative metadata that has been generated by a group of users, also known as collaborative tagging. For example, the user can add tag ç<tutorial>é to the web page http://www.java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/. The advantage of the social tagging system is that we can explore the use of tags to improve web searches \(as index resources Within the community, group members can share the information \(URLs, comments, notes and chatting\ among each other. From the returned results, each user must give the score on the URLs \(as voting\ that most relevant to the keyword search. The system will keep the search inquiry and the re-ranked URLs into the log file. The advantage from this idea is that other users \(within the same group or different groups\ can use the returned results as collaborative filtering and recommendation systems. Finally, we retrieved the data from the log file and performed data analysis to evaluate the usersê behaviors B  Data Collection We developed a search engine module for collecting the documents on the internet. After that, we created the index resourcing. The index simply has to store a reference \(such as a file system path or URLs\o the address documents and return a ranked list of documents from a query expression As pseudo code I illustrates, we created a database and database tables for collecting HTML documents. Next step we set up an index on each page for improving the performance search results and follow any links on page to find other pages, whose links it will also follow   Figure 3  Figure The Architectural Overview of GSS system

For example, user1, user2, user3 and user4 search the same key term as çJava Programmingé and defined the different tags as user1 assigned tag as çJavaé for navigating the web contents as çhttp://www.oracle.com TABLE I  THE ELEMENTS OF THE EXAMPLE RELATIONS  User Tag Item Weight U1 T1:Java I1 :http://www.oracle.com 1 U2 T1:Java I1 :http://www.oracle.com 1 U3 T3:Bitwise I3:http://www.sap-img.com 1 U1 T3:Bitwise I2:http://www.java2s.com/java 1 U3 T1:JSample I1 :http://www.oracle.com 1 U4 T4:JSample1 I4:http://www.java-examples.com 1  When using a social tagging system, to be able to retrieve information items easily, a user U tags an item I with a tag T  After that, the system accumulates a collection of usage data which can be represented by a set of triplets {U, T, I}, as follows 002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\003 004\005\006 007\006\002\002 010 011\012 013 014 015\005 016 017\012 005 020\021\022\014\004\005\023\017 003 004\005\006 007\006\002\002 010 011\012 013 014 015\005 016 017\012 002 020\021\022\014\004\005\023\017  1  Where T \(U, I\ denotes the tags used by user U to annotate item I Y \(U, T\ denote the annotations containing both user u \(item I nd tag T For example, U1 defined a tag label as çJavaé for an item http://www.oracle.com as shown on table II TABLE II  THE ELEMENTS OF THE EXAMPLE RELATIONS  Users Tags Items U1 T1:Java I1 T2: Bitwise I2  I3 U2 T1:JAVA I1 U3 T1: Bitwise I1 T2:JSample I2 U4 T4: JSample1 I4  We assume, a userês in social network may be related together such as co-worker, family or education etc. For example, a pair of users U i and U j have the friendship relations is symmetric and the trust levels over these relations are uniform distributed  002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\024 004\023\005\004\025 007\007\002 trust \(u i u j  2   The trust is the function which defined who is an influence on other users.

We re-ranked the search results by using number 1 for the most preferred and 5 for the least preferred.  The re-ranking method is in rating-based on CF data that users tend to rate on different scales such as if user rate item I1 as ç4é and item I2 as ç8é then we believe I1 is preferred to I 2 We assigned any annotations in re-ranking method as following   k: Rating TABLE IV  A LLOCATION OF WEIGHTS TO ITEMS BY ACTIVE USERS  R i j  I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 U1 10 9 8 7 6 U2 2 5 5 9 10 U3 10 6 6 0 0 U4 9 8 7 3 1  Where Rij is the representation of the content of the document d and the active users i as each user and k is userês weight on each items or Itemj 4\ Moreover, we estimated Rij that separated similarly users or same group by using cluster m \(5\his kind of weighted combination helps us perform ranking of the document using the

The parameters can be adjusted in order to reflect the relative weights of importance given to information from user and community The rank function of Items can be formally defined as rank: R * Q -> R  U {0 here R represents the set of relevant Items Q represents the set user's key term. Without loss of generality, we can view R as the relevant Web pages found by the search engine. Given 002 021 005 002 021   the bigger rank \(r,q the more valuable r to q, i.e., the more valuable for the user If the function rank satisfies 1  002 021 005 002 021 002\005    014 005  017 002  4   2  002 021 005 011 002 014 005  017  002\021  TABLE V  RE RANKING THE SCORES BASED ON THE  PRIORITY ORDER  R i j  I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 U1 1 1 1 2 2 U2 4 4 4 1 1 U3 1 3 3 4 4 U4 3 2 2 3 3  In Table V, the ranks of Items were computed with respect to the active user and the community rank for the documents. We allow a group member to vote the returned results based on the satisfaction. For example, as we consider in the above table, user1 and user 3 preferred the item I1 based on the priority of the item which is 1 here. Similarly user4 shows significant interest to none of the items in the above example \(no high priority rate considered IV  EXPERIMENTS  In this section, in the area of item list recommendations we used the Bayesian Network \(BN\: representation inference and learning. BN is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph DAG We applied the BN based usersê behavior prediction model for generating the most suitable search result or list of items. In this model have 7 nodes as follows   User: Each user on the social network that attend to on items   Term: Key term or query that userês defined for searching on the web resources   Tag: Labels or annotations that defined by each user   Item: web link that matching with userês query   Frequency: the number of user that are traverse   Duration: the duration time \(seconds   Result: the web search results that satisfy by each user   Figure 4  BN representing 7 nodes Figure 4 describe, the node user is a root node, and its prior probability distribution can be read directly from the BN. The result node depends on the values of its parents tag and item etc   Figure 5  The state in each node for BN From Figure 5, we describe the state in each node for BN. From example, user node has 5 states as co_worker co_education, family, friend and others. We assigned the value in each state that take from a log file and learning for this model. As sequent, the result node show the user satisfy as 57% and not_satisfy as 43% . When new user comes, the display result that they will satisfy itês depended on tag, item and term node

CONCLUSION  In conclusion, the strategies for GSS\220s can be summarized as: 1\ group member\220s search history can be collected without direct user involvement; 2\ group categories are classified by topics of interests; 3\ Social tagging uses resources indexing of the query to improve retrieval effectiveness of web search and 4\ a list of vote of the return results is used as profiles to recommend interesting content to the users or group members. From the experiments of this study, we found that the users defined their keyword search differently when they searched for a collaborative web search. We conclude that the collaborative web search is associated with online web search that the group members are actively searching for particular topic The group members usually take into account how other users in the group use their keywords or depend on each user\220s role in the group or group's summary opinion. If the number of group members that are connected together in each group is small, the group members classified by the role or activity such as group of family, co-workers and friends will not correspond with the amount of social tagging represented in the returned results Future efforts to improve GSS will focus on the following. We guarantee a user\220s profile that involves not only tag weight but also semantic relationship between group member\220s preference degrees. A small scale tester of around 20 undergraduate students separated into 3 categories will be conducted. Feedbacks, comments and recommendations of each user based on his/her tag-based user profile will be collected   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  I would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions that could greatly improve the quality of the paper R EFERENCES  1

Therefore the data mining of association rules behind will use these 9 factors to study farmers endowments impact on information technology adoption behavior and their adoption mode C. Mode of farmers information technology adoption based on association rules 1 Association rules are to look for the relationship among different variables in the database, and find out the frequent mode [11 Definition 1: Let   be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let transaction T be a subset of I i.e. I?T . Let  be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID. Let A be an itemset, and transaction T contains A, i.e. TA Definition 2: A rule is defined as an implication of the form BA? ?where IA ? , IB ? ,and ??BA ? . The sets of items A and B are called antecedent \(left-hand-side or LHS and consequent \(right-hand-side or RHS respectively Definition 3 : When BA?  is a rule in database D, it has to satisfy the minimum support S and minimum confidence C Support is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contains the itemset, i.e BAPS Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability  ABP Association rules generation is usually split up into two 


separate steps Step 1: minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database Step 2: these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules 2 In 1994, Agrawal with other scholars worked out Apriori algorithm. The core principle is that the subsets of a frequent itemset are still frequent itemsets and the supersets of an unfrequent itemset are still unfrequent. Moreover, Apriori is a kind of iterative algorithm which is based on a two-stage mining thought for frequent itemsets. In detail, Apriori uses a bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time \(a step known as candidate generation groups of candidates are tested against the data. From L1 to Lk the algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. But one attention of Apriori is that when searching for frequent subset Lk from Lk-1, connection and pruning will be done in the process. And finally association rules will result from the frequent itemsets[12 3 With software Weka3.5.8, some association rules between three information techniques \(call centre, SMS and network platform under the condition of probability=0.5, confidence=0.4 Therefore, some strong association rules with high confidence have been listed typically in Table.2 TABLE II.

The association rules reflect weak relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation. However farmers are still afraid of getting fake information b technique while age = young, job = planting, breeding and selling production, family income = high and public communication channels = wide.

while age=young, education=high, family communication cost=middle and family income=high. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, farmers are still worried about the attitude of neighbors around to their behavior 4.CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION From the mining results, we bring forward following conclusions A. Build various communication channels and provide differentiation information technology Farmers who have few communication channels dont want to adopt new techniques because of their limited family economic ability. We suggest government should try to reduce the risk and cost of technique adoption, promote various communication channels with different charging standards or provide some benefits of different degrees B.  Intensify farmers education and improve farmers certification of techniques Government should undertake some temporary training courses to instruct farmers some new information technologies for rural areas and let farmers be acquaint with these techniques. In this way, first farmers certification and then the information technology adoption rate will be improved C. Reduce technique cost and improve service quality It will do well in the technique promotion when the technique charging is lower and techniques are more various Moreover, considering that the service quality will influence farmers technology adoption intention and behavior information service institutions should try to perfect the quality through better satisfying farmers information demands and more reducing service cost. In this way, farmers information technology adoption will be promoted ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper is sponsored by Beijing forestry university Scientific and Technological Innovation Project BLRW200922 REFERENCES 1] Artesyn technologies: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Phone Covered 99.8% of Administrative Villages While Broadband Covered 96% of Villages and Towns. 3      December  2009. 20 June

Our literature survey discovered an association between them such that rs256871 SNP is part of SEPT8 gene, and, in turn the SEPT8 gene is known to be accountable for tuberculosis among Asians [12 Nonetheless, most of the rules found in this study were difficult to interpret, because, out of more than 660,000 SNPs used in the study, very small numbers of such SNPs had been subject to research for  3 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218008T 4 The Allele Frequency Database, ALFRED, http://alfred med.yale.edu/alfred/mvograph.asp?siteuid=SI218014Q 322 determining the relations with particular traits such as population and geographical region.

Rules extracted from the third experiment where the associations between SNP genotypes and geographical regions are identified The M and m refer to major and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively  6. Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
