Abstract 
Analyzing data is one of todayês hot topics A complete list of elds of research and buzzwords associated with automatic analysis would extend beyond this document 
The importance of this topic stems from the amount of data currently produced in research engineering and other elds The size of these data sets renders manual analysis infeasible Automatic analysis methods are required to cope with the data sets produced The algorithms for ltering categorization and analysis have a long tradition and are manifold This raises the question for the best algorithm The authors of this paper give an overview about manifold automatic analysis approaches along with a classiìcation of these approaches with regard to three different elds of research Keywords comparison monitoring visualization analysis

I I NTRODUCTION In our daily work in the elds of monitoring tracing proìling and analysis of grid cloud cluster and HPC systems we see an ever-increasing amount of data These are e.g monitoring data collected on large numbers of sequential programs as well as tracing data generated by massively parallel application runs Furthermore a lot of other disciplines like life-sciences astrophysics or text analysis have to deal with a rising amount of data Consequently one could assume that comparing data sets in an automatic or semi-automatic 
fashion is a common task and categorizing data is just a matter of selecting the appropriate algorithm Yet after some research we had to realize that there is no ready-for-use algorithm available Subsequently we extended our research to cover more literature started discussions and concluded that data comparison is not as easy as we hoped for Contrary to the large amount of related work in this eld no generic readyto-use algorithm like for number searching or sorting is available An adoption to the respective problem case is necessary and the most suitable algorithm needs to be identiìed In this paper we focus on automatic methods for identiìcation of irregular or unusual behavior Irregular data differs 
from usual often repeating and already analyzed sets of data This data is of special interest and needs to be selected for further manual analysis This identiìcation can be realized by comparison of all data sets against a reference A reference can be e.g a selected single job or artiìcially generated from historical behavior Data with high dissimilarity to the reference is identiìed as irregular This process can dramatically reduce the amount of data which needs to be analyzed manually Subsequently the time and attention of the analyst is used more efìciently allowing a deeper and more accurate evaluation of occurring problems and faults Additionally irregularities caused by jobs or system components in complex job execution 
systems like HPC Grid and Cloud systems can be found automatically and visualized transparently The remainder of this paper is organized as follows In Sec II we describe our analysis problems We give an overview of common visualization techniques for the analysis of data sets in Sec III In Sec IV we present a set of automatic analysis methods and evaluate these methods with regard to our problem cases in Sec V In Sec VI we summarize our contributions and describe future work II F IELDS OF I NTEREST Each author works on a different eld of research that 
requires to nd irregularities compare data sets to identify discrepancies and variations or to categorize data Following we give a brief introduction to these three elds of research 
For job-centric monitoring we use a grid-based monitoring system called AMon utilizing the monitoring infrastructure SLAte 27 W e are looking for a w ay to present the monitoring data in a more meaningful way than to merely show thousands of bars and lines where irregularities are easily overseen Yet we are also looking for general methods that can be directly adapted to other environments working with 
A Job-Centric Monitoring in Distributed Computing Environments 
large job numbers Such environments could be large cluster HPC or cloud systems in particular government hybrid and federated clouds Monitoring data is recorded using variable time intervals ranging from seconds to minutes Used are common monitoring techniques without pri vile ged access rights The recorded data contains information about the job like consumed CPU time CPU load and main memory Also recorded is information about the executing system like free main memory or the state of the storage systems In addition scheduling information such as time date and wall-clock time of the job is collected

B Tracing of Massively Parallel Applications C Dealing with Faults in HPC Systems A Clustering Algorithms 
Performance optimization is essential in the design of scalable parallel applications With increasing complexity and size of todayês HPC-machines this task is getting increasingly important The identiìcation and elimination of bottlenecks and inefìciencies is mandatory to achieve scalability above tens of thousands of processes Tracing has proven to be a powerful approach for performance optimization Using tracing application behavior is recorded in detail by storing a series of events from an application run Events could include entering or leaving a function or sending MPI messages Each event consists of a time-stamp along with relevant data e.g function name or bytes of data transmitted The detailed performance information included in traces make them very suitable for performance analysis For instance they can be used to detect synchronization delays communication inefìciencies or varying performance behavior over time However this advantage also presents a challenge Parallel application runs can easily produce extremely large traces exceeding hundreds of gigabytes Manual analysis of lar ge trace volumes remains challenging even with help of analysis tools like Vampir or Scalasca 70 Currently  users must rely on visual inspection of event traces which is cumbersome and error-prone to say the least Several studies 12 agree that the number of components in future computing systems will increase The studies also predict that the failure rate of single components will not improve As a result the dependability of the whole system will decrease and the probability of faults cannot be ignored any longer Our goal is to detect faults in large data sets such as system log les hardware monitoring data application traces and proìles Furthermore we want to understand and predict the effects of these faults on applications performance to enable developers to implement efìcient error handling methods Usually computing systems show correlated failures In other words an error often implies further errors As a result we not only have to detect single errors but rather nd correlations between multiple faults and generate models for these error chains Finally we combine the resilience data with application performance data to determine the effects of a fault on applications performance For recording performance data we use established techniques like tracing and proìling III V ISUALIZATION T ECHNIQUES The most common method to analyze data is manual inspection by the analyst Manual inspection is the method of choice when it is not clear how to obtain the desired information automatically for instance analyzing the rootcause of an error during a job execution or a machine crash or optimizing a process Today most visualization tools provide graph and statistic displays Graph displays usually show one or multiple parameters over time Some versions use color-coding to present more information on the available screen space Fig 1 shows the GUI of the tool AMon as an e xample of a color coded display Each bar represents an individual job with a measured Fig 1 Screen-shot of the AMon-GUI showing monitoring data of multiple jobs one bar per job with a color-coded representation of the consumed memory of the individual jobs parameter e.g used memory in a color-coded fashion This method is only scalable to hundreds of jobs not only because of the limited screen space The more data to be visualized the more challenging it gets for the analyst to nd relevant information or correlations in reasonable time Another strategy is to reduce the amount of data by accumulation However data reduction comes along with the risk of losing relevant information Typical representations of accumulated data are proìles and statistics Although proìles and statistics are more scalable with respect to available screen space their ability to identify abnormal behavior is limited IV A NALYSIS M ETHODS Following we describe a selection of algorithms and categories of algorithms which appear to be suitable for our ltering and analysis challenges This selection is based on experience discussions with scientists from various elds and literature research It covers a wide range of algorithms and provides an overview of solving strategies applicable to a large number of analysis problems from multiple research areas Clustering algorithms divide data into groups clusters The resulting groups should be meaningful and facilitate understanding and exploration of the data However clustering itself is a difìcult action and is based on many assumptions and contexts As a result many differing clustering algorithms have been developed One of the most simple and known clustering algorithm is k-means 43 48 k-means partitions the data in a number of Voronoi cells by minimizing It assign each data point to the cluster with the nearest mean The number of the cells clusters needs to be known a priori To guide the choice of the tool silhouette 63 is helpful It measures and allows to compare the cluster quality for various numbers of  An adaption of k-means is the k-medoids algorithm  In contrast to the k-means algorithm which computes cluster centers from data points k-medoids chooses data points as cluster centers This makes the algorithm more robust to noise and outliers Both algorithms have a tendency to produce

clusters of the same size which might not be appropriate for all data sets A different clustering approach is applied by the DBSCAN algorithm This algorithm b uilds clusters using the density of data points Very similar close to each other data points build a cluster The algorithm can produce clusters of arbitrary shape and size and is capable of identifying noise points A complete taxonomy of clustering techniques is provided by Jain et al 33 All described clustering algorithms are based on points in n-dimensional space which forbids a direct application using measurement series data A transformation from series of measurements to n-dimensional points e.g by compression methods is required There are various algorithms to realize this One example are Fourier-coefìcient-based methods which tend to focus on frequency information of time series The wavelet-based approach described by numerous authors  62 66 additionally includes timing information A stepwise approximation approach is described by several authors 65 The combination of clustering algorithms and compression is a very generic method and can be used for all kinds of time series data For instance Gavrilov et al use it to analyze the stock-market Considering the large set of available solutions the most challenging part is selecting the most adequate algorithms for clustering and compression along with identifying good parameters Only properly adapted and conìgured algorithms will produce meaningful groups out of the input data Correlation functions known from the eld of signal analysis calculate the similarity of tw o functions The cross-correlation function is deìned as follows 1 denotes the offset between the functions and  There are also adaptations for discrete signals available and it is possible to adapt the continuous function to non-discrete sequences 1 of measurements by using interpolation A typical application for cross-correlation is to determine the time-based shift of two signals An example is shown in Fig 2 is the transmitted signal while is the received signal To determine the time shift between both signals e.g to calculate the distance the signal traveled for usage in radar systems the cross-correlation is calculated The maximum value of the cross-correlation indicates the corresponding value of  which is the time shift between and  The classical usage of cross-correlation allows to align two functions with one arbitrary offset For more complex scenarios containing dynamic changes of the offset and extra loops with repeating sequences a transformation of one of the functions is needed This transformation can be realized by applying a deìned xed offset Consequently the offset in the cross-correlation can be removed by deìning  This 1 Non-discrete sequences are series of measurements where it is not guaranteed that the measurements are taken at constant time intervals Fig 2 Example of two similar non-identical functions shifted by time leads to an optimization problem The cross-correlation has to be maximized by nding a transformation respecting the dynamic time shift caused by altering input data due to e.g heterogeneous hardware CPU or memory speed or system noise Without this transformation the cross-correlation result would be useless as similarity metric One strategy to determine the dynamic time shift of a complete time series is educated guessing Educated guessing uses characteristic points like fast rising CPU usage starting of jobs or writing output to a le It matches corresponding points in both series for a coarse alignment and recalculates the cross-correlation for each pair Depending on the crosscorrelation result the respective pair of corresponding points is retained or discarded Additional optimization strategies are genetic algorithms or machine learning Genetic algorithms e v olv e a start set of solutions towards better solutions They describe a optimization heuristic inspired by natural evolution Goal is to nd a solution called a  with a  A genome consists of a sequence of parameters which are called characters that represent a solution to an arbitrary problem A classiìes a particular genome providing a better solution then other genomes The rst step in a genetic algorithm is the deìnition of a start set of genomes a  The size of the rst population has to be carefully balanced If the size is too large a lot of computing resources are needed to process the evolution step from population to child population Also more evolution steps are needed to produce good results Otherwise if the population is too small the searched parameter range is too limited and the result quality might seriously deteriorate Hence the size of the population is one of the fundamental parameters and needs to be carefully chosen Two common strategies exist for the selection of the genomes solutions for the rst population One strategy is to randomly generate a rst population This enables a search over the whole parameter range but tends to require large populations what poses high demands on computing power The other strategy uses an already found solution set as base for further optimization This reduces the size of the population along with the required computing power dramatically but also reduces the searched parameter range To evolve from one population to the child population containing better solutions genomes the concepts of   and are applied Selection is the

rst step in the evolution process from a population to a child population Therefore the genomes are ranked This is done by testing how well each genome solves the optimization problem Thus a function calculating the quality of the solution produced by a genome is required This function also deìnes the target of the optimization and has enormous inîuence on the found solution After the ranking the best genomes usually the best 50 are selected as source for the generation of a new population After the selection the inheritance step generates a new population using the selected genomes There are various methods to combine genomes to new ones A simple solution is to randomly create pairs of genomes and to combine the rst half of one genome with the second half of the other genome The number of characters taken from the rst genome is also chosen randomly The order of characters in a genome might inîuence the computed solution F or instance the parameter might improve a solution only if parameter has an appropriate value In such case both parameters must be developed together and the inheritance step should tend to take both parameters from the same genome In the end of the inheritance the child population needs to have the same size as the original population The last step to complete the evolution phase is mutation Therefore some genomes are chosen randomly and one or more characters are altered The number of mutations depends on the algorithm conìguration If the number is too small the algorithm behaves like a hill climbing search A too high mutation rate results in a random search and can prevent a stabilization of the population The complete evolution process requires many repetitions The number of repetitions can be either set by the user or the evolution process is repeated until the population is stable In a stable population most or all genomes are the same The result of the genetic algorithm is a dominant or the ttest genome in the last population Why one particular genome is chosen as result cannot be told It is not guaranteed that the result is reproducible by a re-run of the algorithm There is also no guarantee for the globally best solution Comparing sequences is heavily done in the eld of bioinformatics using sequence alignment techniques Goal is to compare gene and protein sequences For instance to nd genes in large genome databases spanning several species The hope is that the knowledge of many occurrences of a particular gene in nature helps in understanding its functionality The difìculty is that genes are likely to mutate across species and along the evolutionary process That makes them hard to spot since searching for direct matches is not sufìcient The alignment algorithms need to identify sequences Mutated gene sequences may consist of areas having the same sequence of nucleotides in both genes Areas can be if they contain different nucleotides at the same sequence position The third possibility is a missing section called a  in one sequence The alignment of two sequences is computed using dynamic programming that nds the optimal alignment for arbitrary sequences 24 53 F or e xample consider an alignment of the following two sequences Sequence mcacmam Sequence mcacbcmbm We use the following notation Sequence is of length and sequence of length  The event in is and the event in is  The dynamic programming algorithm separates the full pairwise alignment problem into independently optimizable sub-problems and then evaluates alignments with scores It uses a recursive scoring scheme to nd the optimal alignment of sub-problems The scoring scheme is adapted to the individual comparison case A typical example for arbitrary sequences is as follows Match Score Mismatch Score Gap Score is chosen if position is the same as  otherwise if differs from then is used In case that either or are aligned to a gap the gap penalty of is applied Based on the scores we deìne the following recursive scoring scheme for a dynamic programming matrix  Match/Mismatch Gap in Sequence Gap in Sequence We nd the optimal alignment by computing the path with the highest score through the matrix from to We show the alignment result for our example using our algorithm in Fig 3 The classical dynamic programming algorithm has quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence lengths  in time and memory This renders the alignment of large sequences impossible due to the limited size of available main memory A modiìcation of the algorithm proposed by Hirschberg computes the optimal alignment with quadratic time complexity but with only linear memory complexity with respect to the longest sequence A similar approach is proposed by Myers His O\(ND algorithm is used in the Unix tool to compare text input Unlike the dynamic programming approach the algorithm does not use a scoring scheme Instead it searches the shortest path through the edit graph of the two sequences The shortest path identiìes and areas of the sequences Compared to the dynamic programming approach this algorithm is less exible Due to the missing scoring scheme it can only decide between two states and

The dynamic programming algorithms can work with arbitrary states by assigning different scores to possible combinations of sequence items The advantage of the O\(ND algorithm is its performance compared to dynamic programming algorithms The performance of the O\(ND algorithm is dependent on the result of the comparison Two almost equal sequences can be compared with nearly linear time complexity The more the sequences differ the slower the O\(ND algorithm gets Two completely different sequences require like dynamic programming quadratic time complexity Intrusion detection is a eld of research which takes the challenge to detect attacks and intrusions into computing systems and networks The used methods and algorithms aim to detect patterns that indicate an attack Often intrusions follow already seen patterns Consequently many implementations for intrusion detection look for these patterns Examples for such implementations are Snort ST A TE 31 IDES 46 IDIOT and Bro 54 A fuzzy deìnition of intrusion patterns is applied by Dickerson A special variant of an intrusion is a worm A worm tries to replicate itself and infect additional systems This behavior forms a known pattern with only little dependence on the actual worm The detection of such behavior is described by several authors 47 60 68 Ho we v er  the detection of a w orm is bound to a deìned scenario an internal computer network connected to an external one This complicates the adaption to other elds of research The search for already known patterns does not allow to nd new not yet understood behavior or attacks To mitigate this disadvantage additional concepts have been developed to cope with new or changing intrusions One of the early concepts is to analyze the statistic of occurring events as described in Sec IV-F Another method is machine learning which is presented in Sec IV-G The basic idea of this approach is the comparison of statistics of events A description of this strategy is given by Denning Later on se v eral authors e xtended this concept  59 In this approach the rst step is to deìne events An event can be the direct occurrence of an action like a log-in attempt into a system or a derivative value like a high network load for some seconds The second step is to compare the rate of these events against a deìned expectation The expectation is based on historical data and can be simple minimal or maximal rates or distributions over time This approach also requires the adaption of the expectation to changing user behavior Machine learning as described in the context of intrusion detection 40]Ö[42 uses a self-learning system The system is trained with historical data The training sets teach the system how to distinct intrusions from normal user behavior After the training phase the skilled system is used to detect intrusions Machine learning can also be used in other elds of research We are interested in using machine learning to distinct normal from irregular behavior For a non-expert in the eld of machine learning it is challenging to select a good algorithm for the actual problem scenario Also the preparation of sufìcient training data is cumbersome and error-prone After the training phase it is recommended to test whether the training was successful Therefore in addition to the training data also test data sets are required There are additional self algorithms available They are in general similar to machine learning Neural network based algorithms are described in 47 Agent based methods can be found in 61 Relationships and dependencies between individual events in data sets can be modeled as trees or graphs This is used for instance to organize databases or to construct XML documents Due to enormous research effort in the area of tree and graph search algorithms both data structures can be queried efìciently today In general tree and graph search algorithms are differentiated into depth-ìrst and breadth-ìrst methods Ho we v er  processing the whole data set is impractical at large-scale In such case heuristics improve the time to nd a satisfying solution Heuristics do not guarantee to nd the optimal solution Nevertheless this constraint can often be accepted There are also algorithms which rely on adjustments by the user to guide the process of nding a solution for a given problem These approaches are similar to machine learning described in Sec IV-G V E VALUATION Following we provide an evaluation of the methods presented in Sec IV Since we are interested in several elds of research we divide this section according to our elds of interest as described in Sec II This also allows to evaluate the methods in the actual problem context Furthermore we provide a summary of the evaluation in Table I Job centric monitoring requires the analysis of measurement series Where a series of measurements represents the collected monitoring data of one job A measurement point in a series consists of a time-stamp along with relevant characteristics about the job itself e.g consumed CPU-time and the respective computing resource e.g free main memory Clustering algorithms can be applied to measurement series in general Necessary for clustering is a prior compression of the time series data Subsequently it has to be ensured that the compression does not eliminate relevant information However with the goal of nding unknown anomalies it is hard to distinguish relevant from non-relevant information at this stage of the analysis Also the clustering algorithm parameters have to be conìgured according to the actual scenario Finally selflearning clustering algorithms e.g based on machine learning

TABLE I E XPECTED USEFULNESS OF ANALYZES METHODS FOR THE THREE TOPICS OF RESEARCH M ONITORING T RACING R ESILIENCE Clustering Algorithms solves problem at least partially and is already in usage very promising algorithm probably usable with strong adaption does not t well strategies look most promising They are also the most complex variants requiring considerable effort for adaption to new problem cases Cross-correlation appears to be a direct match to identify irregular measurement series The challenge is to optimize the algorithm to avoid false-positives caused by heterogeneous systems with e.g different CPU and network speeds This can be realized by educated guessing or other optimization strategies like genetic algorithms Sequence comparison algorithms use input data in the form of a sequence of characters omitting all timing information However the exclusion of all timing information eliminates a relevant part of the information Thus this approach is not considered a suitable solution Pattern matching or searching for known problems is already implemented for job centric monitoring Ho we v er  these methods are not capable of detecting new undeìned problems and can lead to a high false-positives rate Statistic of events is a straight-forward and easy to adapt algorithm It can be automatically adapted to actual job behavior For instance the adaptation can be applied by continuous calculation of statistic over historical job behavior This approach looks very promising Machine learning algorithms require a learning phase to correctly train the algorithm The algorithm results depend highly on the quality of the learning phase However the compilation of a suitable high-quality collection of training examples is very time consuming and error-prone Thus we give preference to other approaches rst The data format required to apply tree and graph search algorithms as well as for direct use of genetic algorithms differs from the generated data format used in job-centric monitoring Due to the needed adaption an implementation of these approaches requires considerable effort

In the eld of performance optimization of parallel applications a range of methods is already successfully applied Casas et al use w a v elet and cross-correlation algorithms to analyze parallel application executions With wavelet analysis they can automatically divide the execution in initialization nalization and computation phase Using crosscorrelation on the computation phase identiìes the individual iterations The automatic identiìcation of the application structure enables further analysis methods like detection of loadbalance problems or automatic speedup analysis Gamblin et al use clustering for the performance analyses of massive parallel applications The clustering process builds groups of similar behaving processes representing the application behavior For each group a representative process representing the behavior of the individual group is selected The analyst can focus on the representative processes and does not need to analyze a massive number of processes anymore Scalasca is able to automatically nd predeìned patterns like synchronization wait-time in the trace data However Scalasca does not guarantee the detection of all occurrences of the predeìned patterns and is only able to detect a subset of all possible performance problems Weber et al use sequence alignment methods to compare event traces of parallel application runs Due to the large number of events manual inspection and comparison of the traces is time consuming and error-prone The described alignment methods compare the traces and automatically identify differences and similarities Genetic algorithms machine learning and graph search algorithms seem not do be suitable for automatic analysis of trace data At least they need an extensive adaption For instance the large amount of events in traces along with the variety of possible event types and their complex dependencies render the preparation of suitable training sets for machine learning algorithms an error-prone task It is challenging to nd real application traces with isolated performance problems Furthermore it is questionable if the algorithms are able to learn the characteristics of certain performance problems and are able to detect trained problems in new traces This is especially true if the traces originate from new applications Using statistics of events is suitable to detect a subset of performance problems For instance it is an appropriate method to detect outliers in the data Common research in the eld of resilience at large scale is mostly based on statistical data for example system log les Martino Lu 45 and Fu et al 17 analyze statistical failure data and use clustering to group failures which correlate in time and space domain Analysis of statistical failure data can indicate possible failure correlations However it does not relate causes and effects directly because statistical data can not model relationships between failures Gainaru et al combine signal analysis and data mining techniques to analyze log les In this work they use signal correlation to distinguish individual event types as well as datamining concepts to analyze correlations between events in the presence of faults In addition Gainaru et al use machine learning techniques to predict normal and faulty application behavior based on the analyses of message transfers

Fault trees and reliability graphs can be used to model systems Nevertheless they are not suitable to analyze system availability Mark o v chains or generalized stochastic Petri nets are more suitable in this case VI C ONCLUSION Methods for automatic or semi-automatic analysis of large data sets are still an active research eld Nevertheless a wide range of methods is already available These methods enable automatic identiìcation of irregular data and hence provide support for tracking down new phenomenons causalities or faults Consequently the amount of information requiring manual inspection as well as the time required for the analysis might be reduced dramatically This work presents a wide range of algorithms relevant for automatic data analysis Since most papers focus only on a single method or compare only very similar or successive versions of algorithms we present a very rare and useful overview Most analysis methods highly depend on the data format and analysis context Hence we surveyed the algorithms for applicability in three different scenarios These use cases have been selected from current research areas Therefore our evaluation of data analysis methods serves as a basis and starting point for scientists facing similar problems A detailed description of the adaption implementation and evaluation of the presented algorithms with example data is beyond the scope of this work For detailed information about individual methods a comprehensive list of related work is provided Additionally a more detailed evaluation of selected methods is planned as future work R EFERENCES  J Balasubramaniyan J Garcia-Fernandez D Isacof f E Spaf ford and D Zamboni An architecture for intrusion detection using autonomous agents In

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
