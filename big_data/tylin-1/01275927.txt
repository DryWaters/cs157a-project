2 FEATURES OF ENGINEERING DOCUMENT 2.1 Noimalized engineeiiug document Engineering documents record enterprises' technical activities and outcomes which are impersonally and orderly described in document contents That is normalized content which results in common use of engineering document 2 6 Normdized content is the prior condition of developing and reusing these engineering documents. The normalized engineering documents are characterized as follows Normalized structures in a series of documents Each techcal action always complies with some disciplines and restrictive sequences. which are shared by a typical speciality Engineering document established in even action is relatively fixed A special engineering document corresponds to a certain structure and specification Normalized contents Technical actions must comply with a certain technical standards and specification For example, Design must conform to the product standardization Routine experiments must be carried out by testing new products These actions are definitely mirrored by engineering documents which appear as nomiahzed engineering document contents Normalized descriptions Concepts and parameters in engineering documents are generally described by a set of terms For example, Technical parameters are described by a set'of dedicated symbols and formulae 2.2 Association in engineering document Editing engineering documents runs from product market analysis to new product making There are similarity and succession among document contents edited in decision-maljng design trial-production and operation stage Namely in a certain estent document contents are edited nith the basis of refemng and modi&Jing legacy documents Let D be a set of product A documents. Where D records the procedure and outcome of product A Let d be a unit document. Where d3 records the procedure and outcome of a unit action The succession of D are embodied in normalized structures and association contents of engineering documents In a case of editing design specification d let d  d:,d:;..d be a set of legacy design specification On the one hand design specification requires every document d to contain the same primary contents These primary contents are abstracted by structures of document d  namely d  S,,S2;..Sn8 St denotes desiy specification S2 denotes product function Each document structure is composed of several sentences Each sentence is composed of several items namely Si  l~,lI?;..1 On the other hand there is a certain statistics regularity in repeating contents between design specification d and d These regularity mostly appear as the following association rules 0 Item i edition is said to contain item j edition if and only if I 3 I Structure i edition is said to contain structure j edition if and only if S Si Structure i edition is said to contain item j edition ifandonlyif S Ij Mining association de in engineering document aims to discover the above-mentioned edition patterns, that is edition knowledge, and aid engineers to publish engineering documents efiiciently and accurately  3 MODELING ASSOCIATION RULES IN ENGINEERING DOCUMENT 3.1 Formal engineeiing document model On account of features of specialization and standardization in engineering document sentences in engineering document can be seen as a set of several engineering terms Idioms figures and forms in engineering document could be represented by special terms As a result a simplified engineering document model is shown as follows Let I  il,i,;..iM}\(A4 2 1 be a set of items let D  dl,d2;..,d be a set of engineering documents where each document di is a set of items A document d is said to be a subset of I That is d c I 340

those overly specific subgroups leading to reasonable posi tive and negative convex hulls Notice, however that CNZ SD still improves on CN2-standard after removing redun dant subgroups Figure 1 Example ROC curves on the Aus tralian data set: solid curvesfor AUC-Method 2 and dotted positive and negative convex hulls for AUC-Method-1 squares for CNZ-SD with additive weights and triangles for CN2 standard 5 Related work Various rule evaluation measures and heuristics have been studied for subgroup discovery IO 241 aimed at bal ancing the size of a group referred to as factor g with its distributional unusualness \(referred to as factor p The properties of functions that combine these two factors have been extensively studied the so-called 221p-g-space\221 lo An alternative measure q   was proposed in 13 for expert-guided subgroup discovery in the TPIFP space aimed at minimizing the number of false positives FP and maximizing true positives TP guided by generalization pa rameter par Besides such 221objective\222 measures of interest ingness some 221subjective\222 measure of interestingness of a discovered pattern can be taken into the account such as ac tionability 221a pattern is interesting if the user can do some thing with it to his or her advantage\222 and unexpectedness 221a pattern is interesting to the user if it is surprising to the user\222 211 Instance weights play an important role in boosting I21 and alternating decision trees 20 Instance weights have been used also in variants of the covering algorithm imple mented in rule learning approaches such as SLIPPER 6 RL 1151 and DAIRY 191 A variant of the weighted cover ing algorithm has been used also in the context of subgroup discovery for rule subset selection 13 6 Conclusions We have presented a novel approach to adapting stan dard classification rule learning to subgroup discovery To this end we have appropriately adapted the covering algo rithm the search heuristics, the probabilistic classification and the performance measure Experimental results on 17 UCI data sets demonstrate that CNZ-SD produces substan tially smaller rule sets where individual rules have higher coverage and significance These three factors are important for subgroup discovery smaller size enables better under standing. higher coverage means larger support, and higher significance means that rules describe discovered subgroups that are significantly different from the entire population We have evaluated the results of CN2-SD also in terms of AUC-Method-2 and shown insignificant increase in terms of the area under the ROC curve In further work we will evaluate the results also by using AUC-Method-1 where each subgroup establishes a sepa rate point in the ROC space and compare the results with the MIDOS subgroup discovery algorithm We plan to in vestigate the behavior of CN2-SD also in multi-class prob lems An interesting question to he verified with further ex periments, is whether the weighted versions of the CN2 al gorithm improve the significance of the induced subgroups also in the case when CN2 rules are induced without ap plying the significance test Finally we plan to use the CNZ-SD subgroup discovery algorithm for solving practical problems in which expert evaluations of induced subgroup descriptions is of ultimate interest Acknowledgements Thanks to Dragan Gamberger for joint work on the weighted covering algorithm and JosC Hernbdez-Orallo and Cesar Ferr-Ramirez for joint work on AUC The work reported in this paper was supported by the Slovenian Min istry of Education Science and Sport the IST-1999-11495 project Data Mining and Decision Support for Business Competitiveness A European Virtual Enterprise and the British Council project Partnership in Science PSP-IS Refer en c e s l R Agrawal H Mannila R Srikant H Toivonen, and A.I Verkamo Fast discovery of association rules In U.M Fayyad G Piatetski-Shapiro P Smyth and R Uthurusamy editors, Advances in Knowledge Discov ery and Data Mining 307-328 AAA1 Press 1996 2 B Cestnik Estimating probabilities: A crucial task in machine learning In L Aiello editor Proc of rhe 9rh European Conference on Artificial Inrelligence 147 149.

association-cube, base-cube and population-cube are derived from the volume cube; the confidence-cube is derived from the association cube and population cube and the support-cube is derived from the associationcube and base-cube. The slices of these cubes shown in Figure 2 correspond to the same list of values in dimension merchant, time, area and customer_group  Multidimensional and multilevel rules Representing association rules by cubes and underlying cubes by hierarchical dimensions, naturally supports multidimensional and multilevel rules. Also these rules are well organized and can be easily queried  First, the cells of an association cube with different dimension values are related to association rule instances in different scopes. In the association cube CrossSales cell CrossSales product \221A\222, product2 \221B\222  customer_group 221engineer\222, merchant \221Sears\222, area \221Los Angeles\222, time 221Jan98\222 represents the following multidimensional rule x 316 Customers: buy_product\(x, \221A\222 336 buy_product\(x,\221B\222  275 customer_group = \221engineer\222, merchant = \221Sears\222, area 221Los  Angeles\222, time =  \221Jan98\222 If this cell has value 4500, and the corresponding cell in the population cube has value 10000, then this rule has confidence 0.45 Next as the cubes representing rules can have hierarchical dimensions, they represent not only multidimensional but also multi-level association rules. For example, the following cells CrossSales\(product \221A\222, product2 \221B\222, customer_group 221engineer\222, merchant \221Sears\222, area \221 California 222, time 221Jan98\222 CrossSales\(product \221A\222, product2 \221B\222, customer_group 221engineer\222, merchant \221Sears\222, area \221 California 222, time 221 Year98 222 represent association rules at different area levels \(i.e the city level and the state level\d different time levels \(i.e., the month level, the year level x 316 Customers: buy_product\(x, \221A\222 336 buy_product\(x, \221B\222  275 customer_group = \221engineer\222, merchant =  \221Sears\222, area 221 California 222, time =  \221Jan98\222 x 316 Customers: buy_product\(x, \221A\222 336 buy_product\(x, \221B\222  275 customer_group = \221engineer\222, merchant =  \221Sears\222, area 221 California 222, time =  \221 Year98 222 The cell CrossSales\(product \221A\222, product2 \221B\222,  customer_group 221top\222, merchant \221top\222, area \221top\222,  time \221top\222 represents the customer-based cross-sale association rule for all customers, merchants, areas, and times in the given range of these dimensions, expressed as x 316 Customers: buy_product\(x, \221A\222 336 buy_product\(x, \221B\222 4.3  Generating Association Rule Related Cubes The basic task of our OLAP based association rule mining framework, either at the GDOS or at an LDOS is to convert a volume cube i.e. the cube representing the purchase volumes of customers dimensioned by product  area etc, into an association cube a base cube and a population cube These cubes are then used to derive the confidence cube and the support cube of multidimensional association rule instances. The following general steps are involved in cross-sale association rule mining 267  Roll up the volume cube SaleUnits by aggregating it along merchant, time, area dimensions 267  Derive cube NumOfBuyers from SaleUnits based on the antecedent condition SaleUnits 0 267  Populate cube NumOfShoppers by the counts of customers dimensioned by merchant, area  time not by product\at satisfy the antecedent conditions 267  Derive cube CrossSales from SaleUnits based on the association conditions SaleUnits  product  p 1  0 and SaleUnits  product2  p 2 0 267  Derive cube Confidence and cube Support using cell-wise operations 214  Confidence = CrossSales  NumOfBuyers 214  Support  CrossSales  NumOfShoppers  Cubes Confidence  Support  CrossSales are dimensioned by product  product2 customer_group,merchant  time, area NumOfBuyers is dimensioned by product  customer_group, merchant time, area  NumOfShoppers is dimensioned by customer_group, merchant  time, area Rules with confidence and support that exceed specified thresholds  may be considered interesting 4.4. Rules with Conjoint Items Cubes with conjoint dimensions can be used to represent refined multidimensional association rules For example, using OLAP, we can derive association rules across time  Time-variant or temporal association rules such as 


x 316 Customers buy_product\(x,\222 A\222, \221 Jan98\222  336 buy _product\(x, \221B\222, \221 Feb98\222   275 area = \221Los Angeles\222 can be used to answer such questions as \223 How are  the sales of B in Feb98  associated with the sales of A in Jan98 224 The items in this rule are value pairs of dimensions product and time In order to specify this kind of association rule we introduce a conjoint dimension product, time and mirror it with dimension product2, time2 This allows a cell in the association cube to cross two time values. Accordingly, the cubes related to association rule mining are defined as follows Association cube  CrossSales.2 \(<product, time>, <product2, time2 customer_group, merchant, area  Population cube  NumOfBuyers.2  \(<product, time>, customer_group merchant, area Base cube  NumOfShoppers.2  \( customer_group, merchant, area Confidence cube Confidence.2 \(<product, time>, <product2, time2 customer_group, merchant, area Support  cube  Support.2  product, time>, <product2, time2 customer_group, merchant, area  The steps for generating these cubes are similar to the ones described before. The major differences are that a cell is dimensioned by, besides others product, time and product2, time2 and the template of the association condition is  SaleUnit s  product p 1 time t 1  0 and  SaleUnits  product2 p 2 time2 t 2  0 where, in any instance of this condition, the time expressed by the value of time2 is not contained in the time expressed by the value of time The template of the antecedent condition is SaleUnits   product p 1 time t 1  0 In general, other dimensions such as area may be added to the conjoint dimensions to specify more refined rules 4.5. Functional Association Rules A multidimensional association rule is functional if its predicates include variables, and the variables in the consequent are functions of those in the antecedent.  For example, functional association rules can be used to answer the following questions, where a_month and a_year are variables q  What is the percentage of people in California who buy a printer in the next month after they bought a PC x 316 Customer buy_product\(x, \221PC\222, a_ month 336 buy_product\(x, \221printer\222, a_month+1  275 area = \221California\222 q  What is the percentage of people who buy a printer within the year when they bought a PC  x 316 Customer: buy_product\(x, \221PC\222, a_ year 336 buy_product\(x, \221printer\222, a_year 275 area = \221California\222 To be distinct, we call the association rules that are not functional as instance association rules; e.g x 316 Customer: buy_product\(x,\222 PC\222, \221Jan98\222 336 buy_product\(x,\222 printer\222, \221Feb98\222  275 area =  \221California\222 Time variant, functional association rules can be derived from time variant, instance association rules through cube restructuring. Let us introduce a new dimension time_delta that has values one_day, two_day 205, at the day level, and values one_month, two_month, \205, at the month level, etc. Then, let us consider the following functional association rule related cubes Association cube  CrossSales.3 \(product, product2, customer_group merchant, area, time_delta  Population cube  NumOfBuyers.3 \(product, customer_group, merchant area Base cube  NumOfShoppers.3 \( customer_group, merchant, area Confidence cube  Confidence.3 \(product, product2, customer_group merchant, area, time_delta Support cube  Support.3 \(product, product2, customer_group, merchant area, time_delta The association cube CrossSales.3  can be constructed from CrossSales.2   The cell values of CrossSales.2  in the selected time and time2 ranges are added to the corresponding cells of CrossSales.3 For example, the count value in cell  CrossSales.2\(<PC, Jan98>, <printer, Feb98>\205 is added to cell \(bin CrossSales.3\(PC, printer, one_month,\205 


It can also be added to cell CrossSales.3\(PC, printer one_year,\205 5  Distributed and Incremental Rule Mining There exist two ways to deal with association rules 267  Static that is, to extract a group of rules from a snapshot, or a history, of data and use "as is 267  Dynamic that is, to evolve rules from time to time using newly available data We mine association rules from an e-commerce data warehouse holding transaction data. The data flows in continuously and is processed daily Mining association rules dynamically has the following benefits 267  223Real-time\224 data mining, that is, the rules are drawn from the latest transactions for reflecting the current commercial trends 267  Multilevel knowledge abstraction, which requires summarizing multiple partial results. For example association rules on the month or year basis cannot be concluded from daily mining results. In fact multilevel mining is incremental in nature 267  For scalability, incremental and distributed mining has become a practical choice Figure 3: Distributed rule mining Incremental association rule mining requires combining partial results. It is easy to see that the confidence and support of multiple rules may not be combined directly. This is why we treat them as \223views\224 and only maintain the association cube, the population cube and the base cube that can be updated from each new copy of volume cube. Below, we discuss several cases to show how a GDOS can mine association rules by incorporating the partial results computed at LDOSs 267  The first case is to sum up volume-cubes generated at multiple LDOSs. Let C v,i be the volume-cube generated at LDOS i The volume-cube generated at the GDOS by combining the volume-cubes fed from these LDOSs is 345   n i i v v C C 1  The association rules are then generated at the GDOS from the centralized C v  214  The second case is to mine local rules with distinct bases at participating LDOSs, resulting in a local association cube C a,I a local population cube C p,I  and a local base cube C b,i at each LDOS. At the GDOS, multiple association cubes, population cubes and base cubes sent from the LDOSs are simply combined, resulting in a summarized association cube and a summarized population cube, as 345   n i i a a C C 1   345   n i i p p C C 1  and 345   n i i b b C C 1  The corresponding confidence cube and support cube can then be derived as described earlier. Cross-sale association rules generated from distinct customers belong to this case In general, it is inappropriate to directly combine association cubes that cover areas a 1 205, a k to cover a larger area a In the given example, this is because association cubes record counts of customers that satisfy   customer product merchant time area Doe TV Dept Store 98Q1 California Doe VCR Dept Store 98Q1 California customer product merchant time area Doe VCR Sears 5-Feb-98 San Francisco Joe PC OfficeMax 7-Feb-98 San Francisco customer product merchant time area Doe TV Fry's 3-Jan-98 San Jose Smith Radio Kmart 14-Jan-98 San Jose Association   population      base          confidence      support cube               cube                cube         cube                cube LDOS LDOS GDOS 


the association condition, and the sets of customers contained in a 1 205, a k are not mutually disjoint. This can be seen in the following examples 214  A customer who bought A and B in both San Jose and San Francisco which are covered by different LDOSs , contributes a count to the rule covering each city, but has only one count, not two, for the rule A  336  B covering California 214  A customer \(e.g. Doe in Figure 3\who bought a TV in San Jose, but a VCR in San Francisco, is not countable for the cross-sale association rule TV  336 VCR covering any of these cities, but countable for the rule covering California. This is illustrated in Figure 3 6  Conclusions In order to scale-up association rule mining in ecommerce, we have developed a distributed and cooperative data-warehouse/OLAP infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to generate association rules with enhanced expressive power, by combining information of discrete commercial activities from different geographic areas, different merchants and over different time periods. In this paper we have introduced scoped association rules  association rules with conjoint items and functional association rules as useful extensions to association rules The proposed infrastructure has been designed and prototyped at HP Labs to support business intelligence applications in e-commerce. Our preliminary results validate the scalability and maintainability of this infrastructure, and the power of the enhanced multilevel and multidimensional association rules. In this paper we did not discuss privacy control in customer profiling However, we did address this issue in our design by incorporating support for the P3P protocol [1 i n  ou r data warehouse. We plan to integrate this framework with a commercial e-commerce system References 1  Sameet Agarwal, Rakesh Agrawal, Prasad Deshpande Ashish Gupta, Jeffrey F.
