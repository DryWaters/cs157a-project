of the most promising research topics in the 1990s The essential problem faced in the mining of association rules is the generation of large items which are items that are present in at least s minimal support of the total database tuples As the large items and their counts information usually require much storage space, the minimal cover concept is introduced to achieve reductions in the storage size Percentage contour an extension of minimal 
cover is further introduced to aid in the handling of large databases 1 INTRODUCTION database Given a database of sales transactions association rules can be described as follows  Data mining can be defiied as the process of discovering hidden and potentially useful information from very large databases It has been recognized as one of the most promising research topics in the 1990s by both database and machine learning researchers 2-lo 
The purpose of database mining is to transform information expressed in terms of stored data into knowledge expressed in terms of generalized statements or rules about some characteristics or relationships occurring in data Many important types of rules can be derived from databases They include rules like classification sequential patterns and similar sequences 5 etc In SI Agrawal et a1 introduced a new class of rules called association 
rules and further provide the algorithm for finding such rules from a 0-7803-3280-6/96/%5.00 @1996 IEEE  988  The essential problem of mining association rules is to find all items, that are present in at least s of the total database tuples The value s is known as the minimal support It is important not to confuse support with confidence While confidence is a measure of a rule\222s strength, support corresponds to 
statistical significance SI We refer to all items that have fractional transaction support above the minimal support as large items and all others as small items or non-large items Discover all association rules such that in at least c of transactions, the presence of an item or a set of attributes implies the occurrence of another item The value c is the confidence factor or confidence threshold 
of the rule One such example is 223If a customer buys bread and butter then the customer also buys milk in at least 90 of the cases\224 The antecedent of this rule consists of bread and butter while the consequent consists of milk alone Consider a supermarket with a 222large collection of items Common business decisions that the management of the supermarket has to make include what items to 
put on sales how to arrange the items on the shelves in order to maximize the profit etc SI Thus association rules are considered important rules in the real world and have been widely applied to various databases Applications on databases include customer behaviour analysis on sales data obtained from a large retailing company SI a course enrollment database in a university 4 and a telephone company fault management database 4 


When association rules are frequently probed by users it is expensive to search the database to discover the rules every time. Alternatively we can choose to store all the association rules However the number of association rules is usually much larger than the number of large items as shown in 4 Thus it is still preferable to store the large items and their counts rather than the association rules If there are only a few large items storage of the large items and their counts do not cause much problem However once the number of large items becomes huge the storage is no longer feasible To solve the above problem we introduce the concept of minimal covers which are able to reduce the amount of information stored We further extend the concept of minimal covers and present the concept of percentage contours which can aid in the handling of large databases Applications of both the minimal covers and percentage contours will be presented as well The rest of this paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we will be giving a formal description of the underlying model In Section 3 we present to readers the definition of minimal cover and its storage structure By extending the concept of minimal covers we further present the concept of percentage contour In Section 4 we conduct four operations based on minimal covers and percentage contours Concluding remarks will be given in Section 5 2 DESCRIPTION OF MODEL Let T be a database of transactions or tuples where each tuple t is represented as a binary vector We would then have Attr\(T which is the set of all attributes in T An item I  I Iz  I where each element Ii for 1 I i I m is an attribute is a nonempty subset of Attr\(T A tuple t is known to satisfy an item I if for all attributes Ii in I t[Ii  1 For a given item I count\(1 or the count of item I is the total number of tuples in the database that satisfy I If there exists two items X and Y such that X c Y then X is known as the parent or ancestor of Y On the other hand Y becomes the child or descendant of X Also if the number of different attributes between X and Y is m, then Y is known as the m-extension of X Since X, being the parent of Y consists of less attributes than Y therefore count\(X 2 count\(Y will always hold By an association rule we mean an implication of the form X j Y X and Y are both items which can consist of either a single attribute or a set of attributes One point to note is that Y does not contain any common attributes as X that is  X n Y  0 The rule X Y is satisfied in the set of tuples T with the confidence threshold 0 5 c 5 1 iff at least c of tuples in T that satisfy X also satisfy Y We use the notation X  Y I c to specify that the rule X Y has a confidence threshold of c or simply X a Y if no confusion arises The rule X count XY Y I c is also equivalent to 2 c. The count x support for a rule X a Y is defined to be the fraction of tuples in T that satisfy t[Ii  1 for all Ii in XY Support of an item I is defined to be the fraction of tuples in the database that satisfy I If we are interested only in those items that have their support exceeding a certain threshold, this support becomes the minimal support Therefore I is considered to be large if its support is greater than or equal to the minimal support As shown in 8 the problem of mining association rules can be decomposed into two subproblems  Generate all large items X such that count\(X 2 s  Card\(T where s is the minimal support and Card\(T\is the total number of tuples in the database T 0 For each large item X  IIIz  Ik k 2 2 generate all possible association rules Y X  Y such that Y c X and 1 I length\(Y I k-1 Note  length\(Y\refers to the length of Y The length of an item is equivalent to the number of attributes it consists of In general an n-length item or an item in level-n will consist of n attributes Once the large items have been determined the solution to the second subproblem becomes quite straightforward In this paper however we shall not  989  


have any discussions on the determination of large items since we are placing our efforts on the introduction of minimal covers and its applications Before we embark on the discussion of minimal covers we would just like to mention that the large items generated from the database are stored according to their lengths 3 CONCEPT OF MINIMAL COVERS In this section we shall introduce to readers the concept of minimal covers which can be used to reduce the amount of information or data stored Such a reduction is particularly important when the databases concerned are distributed The reason is  For distributed databases we cannot avoid the possibility of transmitting data from one site to another Since transmission of huge data takes time and causes much traffic over the network it will be beneficial if we can transmit minimum possible data and yet not miss out on any important information As a result the concept of minimal covers is proposed 3.1 FORZMAL MODEL OF MINIMAL COVERS An itemset is a set consisting of items Given an itemset S we define the generating set of S g\(S as a collection of items in S and all their ancestors g\(S is also called the closure of S In turn S is called the generator of g\(S Definition 3.1 An itemset X is a cover of itemset S iff X is a subset of S S Definition 3.2 For itemset X to be a minimal cover of itemset S X must be a cover of S and X E Y for every cover Y of S Example Given S   11 12 13 4 1112 1113 Illcl Let X   Ilb 1113,114 1213 1 Y   13 4 IIL 111213  and Z   114 111213  Itemset X is not a cover since item 111213 cannot be generated from X Both itemsets Y and Z are covers since all items present in S can be generated from them However Z c Y therefore itemset Y is not a minimal cover of S 1213 111213 1 The minimal cover of itemset S denoted as MC\(S is actually the set of all maximal items of S We call items that are not included in any other items of S as maximal items In another word maximal items can never be the parents of any items in S We present the following theorem to illustrate the content of a minimal cover Theorem 3.1 The minimal cover of itemset S is exactly the set of all maximal items of S Proof Let M  set of all maximal items of S For any arbitrary item x in S x is either in M or is an ancestor of some item y in S In the latter case y is either in M or y is also an ancestor of some item z in S The list goes on and eventually the expansion will end at an item in M This shows that x is either in M or is the ancestor of some item in M Thus M is indeed a cover and therefore contains the minimal cover On the other hand a cover of S must always contain M otherwise it cannot be a cover Ci For any given generating set g\(S its corresponding minimal cover contains sufficient and necessary information to allow reconstruction of g\(S Thus minimal covers are considered as the most compact subsets with respect to generating sets To store a minimal cover MC it is divided into subsets according to the lengths of its items Figure 3-1 shows the storage structure m:numberofsJbsets I,:hphofitemsinenchsJbset n  numk of items m each SubM Figure 3-1  Storage Format of a Minimal Cover 3.2 PERCENTAGE CONTOUR We shall now embark on the discussion of the extension of minimal covers the percentage contour A contour is defined as a collection of itemsets SI  S in which any two arbitrary itemsets Si and S 1 I i I n 1 I j I n is either Si c Sj or Sj Si  990  


Suppose we have a database T with Card\(T referring to the number of tuples in T For 0 5 c I 1 where c is any arbitrary support value we define a percentage set as GE\(c  all items in T which have counts 2 c  Card\(T Usually we have GE\(0  all items in T and GE 1  0 When c1  c2 GE\(c2  GE\(cl   X I X is an item in T and c1 Card\(T  count\(X 2 c2  Card\(T For 1  CI c2   c 0 the set PC   GE\(ci 1 i  1 2   n  forms the percentage contour of database T where GE\(cl c GE\(c2   c GE\(c Let a percentage contour PC   GE\(cl   GE\(c where CI c2    Cn  To keep the storage space of PC small we store only the minimal cover MC for each i instead of the whole set of GE\(c To further save on storage space we store in PC the set Ac  GE\(c  GE\(C instead of GE\(c,\itself Now that we store only Ac  GE\(c  GE\(c we need to reconstruct the set GE\(c,\using GE\(c,.J U Ac The storage of the percentage contour is slightly modified from that of a minimal cover The differences are  i there is an additional field pi indicating the lower percentage bound of a particular percentage set ii the maximal items belonging to all the percentage sets are stored separately from the percentage set information The modified storage format is shown in Figure 3-2 t p  lowcr hound of ik pcrccntrgc rangc m  numher of suhtee Ir length of itcms in tach suhsct nr  number of itcms in each suhsct Minimal cover being the most compact way in representing a complete set, can be used to facilitate large distributed database mining in various ways Four important and useful types of operations that can be applied to the minimal covers are discussed below For discussion assume that we have a database T that is distributed over n sites with each site i having a fragment Ti Let the nth site be the coordinator while the other sites are the participants 4.1 UNION OPERATION We are interested in finding for each site all the large items that have a local support of at least c After which we would like to compile the items from each site into a single result set First of all all the participants have to transmit S,\(c  all items in TI that have count 2 c  Card\(T   After receiving S,\(c from all participants the coordinator will perform Su  u:=,S,\(c which includes its own set S,\(c Note  The transmission of all SI sets discussed in this section and later sections are done using minimal covers so that we can reduce the amount of data to be transmitted The purpose of the union operation is not solely to combine all items collected from each site into a single set It needs to identify items that may be redundant due to the presence of their descendants in the result set Therefore all items except those that belong to the highest level will be examined Any items found to be covered by any higher level items will be excluded from the final result set The end result is a union result set that is kept to the minimum possible size In I a new algorithm for determining the large items has been proposed This algorithm brings into light another area whereby the union operation proves to be useful even in a centralized database Figure 3-2  Storage Format of a Percentage Contour Information Basically the algorithm executes in two phases In the first phase the database is horizontally divided into a number of non-overlapping partitions The  oPERAT1oNS OF AND PERCENTAGE CONTOURS partitions are considered one at a time and all the large items for that partition are generated At the  991  


end of this phase all the local large items for each partition are merged to generate a set of potential global large items In the second phase the actual support for these items are generated and the large items are identified After a brief look at the algorithm we notice that the union operation is applicable at the end of the first phase whereby the local large items from each partition are merged into a single set. This merging process is equivalent to the union operation whereby all items from different sets are combined into a single union result set 4.2 INTERSECTION 0 PERATIO N Now we wish to find all large items that have global minimal support of at least c Let us start off the discussion with n  2 We have Sl\(cl  all items in TI that have count 2 c1  Card\(T1 and Sz\(c2  all items in T2 that have count 2 c2  Card\(T2 For any item X in Sl\(cl n S2\(c2 it is true that count\(X 2 cl  Card\(T1  c2  Card\(T2 If c1  Card\(T1  c2  Card\(T2 2 c  Card\(T then all items in Sl\(cl n S2\(c2 are large items with respect to the support factor c In general the coordinator will first collect S,\(c from participant i 1 5 i 5 n where 0 5 c 5 1 and c c Card\(Ti  c  Card\(T  we select c  c for all i  1 2  n if we do not have any prior knowledge The coordinator will generate two sets sI  n s and sC  n S cl and transmit them to the participants Note  The complement operation will be discussed in Section 51.3 All items in SI becomes part of the result set since they are already known to be large. However all items in Sc are ignored since they are already known to be small Only the remaining items, that is those items that are neither in SI nor in Sc will be considered for further examination 4.3 COMPLEMENT OPERATION For this operation given an itemset S we are interested in finding all items that are not present in S To simplify our discussion assume we have a centralized database T with tuples that have four attributes  11 12 13 14  With four attributes we can form a total of    4  6  4  1  15 different combinations of attributes For example we have items 11 12 13 and I4 in level L1 and a single item 111213b in level L4 Suppose SI now contains the following items   11 12 13 1112 1113 I213  The complement set Sc is supposed to contain all possible combinations that are not present in S In this case 11121314 1 SC   14 1114 I2L7 1314 1112139 1112149 111314 I213I4 To keep the complement result set small we only need to store items that are not present in SI and have length less than or equal to the maximum possible length in SI All other items with greater length are trivially known to be part of the complement set. Similar to the union operation our complement result set is dept to the minimum possible size Therefore when the need arises for the above SC to be transmitted to another site only  14 IIL 1214 1314  need to be transmitted All others  111213 111214 1113L 121314 11121314  can be constructed by the receiver itself, provided it knows the maximum possible number of attributes which is four in this case I 4.4 DIFFERENCE OPERATION Given two sets SI and S2 the difference result set SD  S2  SI Basically the difference operation is useful when given two itemsets we are interested in collecting all items that are present in one set but not the other One application of the difference operation is  Refer to the example given in Section 5.1.3 we mentioned that the complement set SC contains all items that are not present in a given set SI Assume we are to find the complement set for SI which contains  11 12 13 1112 1113 1213  Let S2 contain all items with length less than or equal to maxlength  11  1112  1314  By performing SD  S2  SI we are able to obtain the complement set of SI that has been kept to the minimum possible size  992  


5 CONCLUSION The main advantage of the minimal cover lies in the savings of storage space In fact savings on the storage space increases as the minimal support value decreases As we know that transmission of data from one site to another creates much traffic over the network the decrease in data stored is especially beneficial when there is a need for transmission We deduce that not only can minimal cover be applied to distributed database systems which occur often in real-world applications it is also attractive to a cliendserver environment By extending the concept of minimal covers we introduce the percentage contour which is defined as a collection of percentage sets Each set is just a collection of items that have counts greater than or equal to a certain percentage of the total database tuples The percentage contour is economically stored as a set of minimal covers in order to save storage space The number of percentage sets in a percentage contour is only limited by the storage space available As percentage contour can be used to facilitate large database mining the more percentage sets it contains the more accurate will be the results We further explore the various areas under which the minimal covers and the percentage contours proved to be useful. Four operations namely union intersection, complement and difference operations which when applied on the percentage contours helped us to achieve different purposes For example the intersection and complement operations together helped us to determine global large items for a distributed database Another area of application is the compact storage of counts information which facilitates the answering of the fallowing 2 queries  Given an item X estimates its count Given a value 0  c  1 search for all items X that have count\(X 2 c  Card\(T where Card\(T  total number of tuples in database T REFERENCES 71 91 A Savasere E Omiecinski and S Navathe 223An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases\224 Proceedings of the 21st VLDB Conference, pages 432-444 Zurich Switzerland 1995 G Piatetsky-Shapiro Proceedings of AAAI-91 Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Databases July 1991 Anaheim, California G Piatetsky-Shapiro and W Frawley Proceedings of IJCAI-89 Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Databases August 1989, Detroit Michigan H Mannila H Toivonen and A Inkeri Verkamo 223Efficient Algorithms for Discovering Association Rules\224 Proceedings of AAAI-94 Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Databases Eds Usama M Fayyad and Ramasamy Uthurusamy pages 18 1  192 Seattle Washington, July 1994 R Agrawal 223Database Mining\224 Tutorial in DASFAA 95 April 1995 Singapore R Agrawal and R Srikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules\224 Proceedings of the 20th VLDB Conference pages 487-499 Santiago Chile 1994 R Agrawal S Ghosh T Imielinski B Iyer and A Swami 223An Interval Classifier for Database Mining Applications\224 Proceedings of the 18th VLDB Conference pages 560-573 Vancouver British Columbia, Canada 1992 R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami 223Mining Association Rules Between Sets of Items in Large Databases\224 SIGMOD-93 pages 207-2 16 1993 Washington DC USA R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami 223Database Mining  A Performance Perspective\224 IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 5\(6 December 1993 R Krishnamurthy and T Imielinski 223Practitioner Problems in Need of Database Research  Research Directions in Knowledge Discovery\224 SIGMOD Record 20\(3 September 1991  993

to the nasty DOS attacks we did not aggregate all the connection records into a single training data set Instead we extracted all the connection records that fall within a surrounding time window of plus and minus 5 minutes of the whole duration of each attack to create a data set for each attack type We also randomly extracted sequences of normal connections records to create the normal data set 5.2.1 Manual and Automatic Feature Construction Following the feature construction approach described in Section 4 for each attack type e.g syn 003ood port-scan etc we performed pattern mining and comparison using its intrusion data set and the normal data set We constructed appropriate features according to the intrusion only patterns Here we summarize the temporal and statistical features automatically constructed by our system 017 The 223 same host 224 feature that examine only the connections in the past 2 seconds that have the same destination host as the current connection 226 the count of such connections the percentage of connections that have the same service as the current one the percentage of different services the percentage of the S0 003ag and the percentage of the REJ i.e rejected connection 003ag 017 The 223same service\224 features that examine only the connections in the past 2 seconds that have the same service as the current connection 226 the count of such connections the percentage of different destination hosts the percentage of the S0 003ag and the percentage of the REJ 003ag We call these the time-based 223traf\002c\224 features for connection records There are several 223slow\224 PROBING attacks that scan the hosts or ports using a much larger time interval than 2 seconds for example one in every minute As a result these attacks did not produce intrusion only patterns with the time window of 2 seconds We sorted these connection records by the destination hosts and applied the same pattern mining and feature construction process In stead of using a time window of 2 seconds we now used a 223connection\224 window of 100 connections and constructed a mirror set of 223host-based traf\002c\224 features as the timebased 223traf\002c\224 features We discovered that unlike most of the DOS and PROBING attacks the R2L and U2R attacks don't have any 223intrusion only\224 frequent patterns This is because most of the DOS and PROBING attacks involve sending a lot of connections to some host\(s in a very short period of time and therefore can have frequent sequential patterns that are different from the normal traf\002c The R2L and U2R attacks are embedded in the data portions of the packets and normally involve only a single connection Therefore it is unlikely that they can have any unique frequent traf\002c patterns In other words our automatic feature construction process failed to produce any features for these attacks After studying the outcome of this mining process we focussed our attention to the content of the connections In the Bro event handlers we added functions that inspect data exchanges of interactive TCP connections e.g telnet ftp smtp etc These functions assign values to a set of 223content\224 features to indicate whether the data contents suggest suspicious behavior These features are number of failed logins successfully logged in or not whether logged in as root whether a root shell is obtained whether a su command is attempted and succeeded number of access to access control 002les e.g 223/etc/passwd\224 223.rhosts\224 number of compromised states on the destination host e.g 002le/path 223not found\224 errors and 223Jump to\224 instructions etc number of hot indicators e.g access to system directories creation and execution of programs etc and number of outbound connections during a ftp session Our approach here is to include an extensive set of indicators and then let classi\002cation programs decide which minimal set of discriminating features should be used to identify intrusions 5.2.2 Detection Models It is evident that different categories of intrusions require different sets of constructed features in order to be detected We therefore built classi\002cation models using different feature sets 017 The 223traf\002c\224 model each connection record contains the 223intrinsic\224 and the 223traf\002c\224 features Table 7 shows some example labeled connection records The resultant RIPPER classi\002er detects the DOS and PROBING attacks Table 8 shows some example RIPPER rules 017 The host-based 223traf\002c\224 model each connection record contains the 223intrinsic\224 and the host-based 223traf\002c\224 features The resultant RIPPER classi\002ers detect the slow PROBING attacks 017 The 223content\224 model each connection record contains the 223intrinsic\224 and the 223content\224 features Table 1 shows some example labeled connection records The resultant RIPPER classi\002er detects the R2L and U2R attacks Table 2 shows some

Although our models were intended for misuse detection we had hoped that the features we constructed would be general enough so that the models can detect new variations of the known intrusions Table 10 compares the detection rates of old intrusions and new intrusions Here new intrusions refer to those that did not have corresponding instances in the training data We see that our models were able to detect a large percentage of new PROBING and U2R attacks but not as effective for new DOS and R2L attacks 5.2.4 Discussion PROBING attacks have relatively limited variance because they all involve making connections to a large number of hosts or ports in a given time frame Likewise the outcome of all U2R attacks is that a root shell is obtained without legitimate means e.g login as root su to root etc Thus for these two categories of attacks given some representative instances in the training data our data mining system was able to construct features that capture their general behavior patterns As a result our detection models can detect a high percentage of old and new PROBING and U2R attacks On the other hand DOS and R2L have a wide variety of behavior because they exploit the weaknesses of a large number of different network or system services The features constructed based on the available attack instances are very specialized to the known attack types Our detection models therefore missed a large number of new DOS and R2L attacks The results here are not entirely surprising since our models are misuse detection models We need to use anomaly detection models on network traf\002c or system programs to guard against the new and diversi\002ed attacks Anomaly detection is much more challenging than misuse detection For example we need to 002rst decide whether we should build normal pro\002le for each network service or a group of services and for each host or a groups of hosts The feature construction process will likely to be more complex since unlike a relatively small number of 223intrusion only\224 patterns normal network traf\002c can have a large number of variations Network anomaly detection is an important problem and an active area of research 5.3 User Anomaly Detection 223Insiders\224 misusing their privileges can be hard to detect since they don't normally need to break-in and IDSs and security personnel tend to focus on guarding outside attacks Insider problems are some of the most vexing problems for security personnel Indeed who checks the checkers i.e the person to whom the IDS reports It is often very dif\002cult to classify a single event by a user as normal or abnormal because the unpredictable nature of most people A user's actions during a login session needs to be studied as a whole to determine whether he or she is behaving normally Our initial exploratory approach is to mine the frequent patterns from user command data and merge or add the patterns into an aggregate set to form the normal usage pro\002le of a user A new pattern can be merged with an old pattern if they have the same left-hand-sides and right-hand-sides their support values are within a 5 of each other and their con\002dence values are also within 5 of each other To analyze a user login session we mine the frequent patterns from the sequence of commands during this session This new pattern set is compared with the pro\002le pattern set and a similarity score is assigned Assume that the new set has n patterns and among them there are m patterns that have 223matches\224 i.e rules that they can be merged with in the pro\002le pattern set then the similarity score is simply m n  Obviously a higher similarity score means a higher likelihood that the user's behavior agrees with his or her historical pro\002le User Normal Activities sysadm logs in as root cats the password 002le and runs commands such as top programmer1 writes public domain C code use a vi editor compiles the C code reads and sends mail and executes unix commands programmer2 a similar user pro\002le but works in afternoons and evenings secretary edits latex 002les runs latex reads mail and sends mail manager1 reads and sends mail manager2 reads mail Table 11 User Descriptions The DARPA data also includes user anomaly data to evaluate anomaly detection systems Table 11 describes the consistent behavior of the 6 users for anomaly analysis Note that since we were the only group that performed anomaly detection on the test data Lincoln Labs did not evaluate our results We report our experiments on the training data here We apply our frequent episode algorithms to the command data from each login session of the same user with command as the axis feature and w 5 i.e we look for patterns within the range of 5 consecutive commands to mine the frequent sequential patterns on the associations among user commands their arguments time segments and hosts We treat the 002rst 4 weeks as a data gathering period during which we simply merge the patterns into each user's pro\002les Each user has 3 pro\002les one for the ac11

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
