Introduction Classification of underwater acoustic signal is one of the important fields of pattern recognition and has been extensively studied in the last ten years l Researches on this topic fall into two categories feature extraction and classification algorithm Though many techniques of feature extraction have been developed features from different classes are remarkably overlapped due to the complicated mechanism of vessel radiated noise Several kinds of neural networks have been used as classifiers of vessel radiated noises 3 
yet the classification of underwater acoustic signal is still a tough problem owing to the complicated mechanism of subtle targets and their diverse environments Bearing this problem in mind we notice that some up to date research results on classification and association mining are beneficial to tackle the above problem Classification and association mining were studied in isolation for many years until recently discussed the use of association rule mining for the discovery of models of the data that may not cover all classes or all examples 5 used association rules and prunes rules 
using both the minimum support and the pessimistic estimation to implement a classification algorithm called CBA Classification Based on Associations proposed a method to build a decision tree from association rules However the potential of these association rule based classification techniques has not been fully uncovered and few papers using these techniques to the field of target recognition have been reported up to now. Learning from the experience of training man experts in sonar we propose a two-phase training algorithm with association 
rules enhanced classifier for the classification of underwater acoustic signal Usually training an expert need a long and laborious procedure Sometimes they have to listen to and distinguish the records of some similar but often mistaken vessels Inspired by this procedure we aim to exploit the association rules to reveal the understandable intrinsic rules contributing to correct classification in the known misclassification datasets so as to build a classifier with high accuracy and robustness which combines the advantages 
of both probabilistic neural networks PNN and association rules based classifiers 2 CBA The main idea of CBA algorithm is to build a classifier from the complete set of classification association rules that satisfy the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence Classification rules are a special subset of association rules whose right-hand-side are restricted to the classification class attribute Compared with neural network classifiers classification rule built classifiers are easy to understand and realize Here we omit the detail of 
CBA algorithm that is composed of two parts including a rule induction algorithm and a classifier-building algorithm 3 Algorithm of association rules enhanced classification Our objectives are 1 to separate the misclassification region of the feature space and 2\to dig out the intrinsic rules that contribute to make correct classification in the misclassification region Hence we propose a two-phase 582 0-7695-1119-8/01 17.00 0 2001 IEEE 


training algorithm to enhance the predicative accuracy of classifier For a given training set T a portion of training cases is treated as an actual training set T\222 in the first phase Because of ease of training and a sound statistical foundation in Bayesian estimation theory we train a probabilistic neural network called PNN-1 to model the training set T  Then input the whole set T into the trained network thus T falls into two subsets noted by T and T respectively The former is a set that has been correctly classified, and the latter is the rest that has been misclassified In the next phase we suppose that there are effective low dimension patterns in the misclassification region though high dimension patterns in the misclassification region are overlapped Intuitively classification association rules can be exploited to discover these possible low dimension patterns Thus the CBA algorithm is applied to mine the classification association rules in T and construct an association rules based classifier CBA-1, which is of the following format where r is a classification association rule selected from all rules which are both frequent and accurate Obviously CBA-1 is a local or partial classifier with respect to the whole feature space, therefore it is necessary to build a probabilistic neural network PNN-2 to perform a classification of two subsets T and T  For a new input case the classifier PNN-2 is used to decide which sub classifier will be chosen as the final classifier If the new case is classified as A4 it will be classified by CBA-1 otherwise it will be hrther classified by PNN-I Based on the partition of training set T and enhanced by classification association rules it is reasonable that new cases within or near to the misclassification region T will be correctly classified by CBA-I On the other hand most other new cases classified into C class will tend to be correctly classified by PNN 1 or at least not to be more easily misclassified than using the PNN-1 to classify them directly I r2  r default-class 92.1 TWO phase 4 Experimental results 82.0 84.3 89.3 86.9 A preliminary experiment applying the proposed algorithm to the classification of four classes of real vessel radiated noise data which have 964 cases altogether is carried out Feature vectors extracted from these cases compose the whole dataset We use a half of the set as training set T and a half of T as the actual training set T  The left 482 cases are tested using the two-phase constructed classifies PNN-2 PNN 1 and CBA-1 compared with a straightforward probabilistic neural network classifier PNN-0 treating T as training set directly Table 1 shows the results of 10-fold cross validation All recognition rates of test set are the average of 10 folds, and we keep to use the same training and test sets for the PNN-0 and two-phase constructed classifiers during the cross validation The class labels of four classes of vessel radiated noises are I 11 111 and IV respectively Table 1 Test results of two-phase constructed and PNN-0 classifiers Classifier I I I I1 I 111 I IV I Average PNN-0 I 91.5 I 82.2 I 80.7 I 86.9 I 85.3 5 Conclusion Inspired by the experience of training man experts in sonar we propose a two-phase training algorithm to exploit the association rules to reveal the understandable intrinsic rules contributing to correct classification in the known misclassification datasets in this paper Preliminary experimental results from real data demonstrate the potential of classification association rules to enhance the accuracy of classification of underwater acoustic signals In our future work we will focus on studying the impact of the partition of the feature space and discretization of continuous attributes We suggest that using this algorithm as an incremental training algorithm and adding experts interfered selection of rules are beneficial to improve the performance of practical classification system for underwater acoustic signal References J Huang J Zhao and Y Xie 223Source classification using pole method ofAR model\224 IEEE ICASSP-97 1997 Vol J Chen H Li J Sun and Z Li 223Fractal feature of underwater acoustic signals in zero-crossing domain\224 WESTPRAC VII Kumamoto, Japan 2000 pp 1129-132 X Li F Zhu 223Application of the zero-crossing rate LOFAR spectrum and wavelet to the feature extraction of passive sonar signals\224 Proc 3rd World Conf Intell Cont.& Auto., 2000 Vol 4 pp 2461-2463 K Ali S Manganaris and R Srikant 223Partial classification using association rules\224 KDD 1997 pp B Liu W Hsu and Y Ma 223Integrating classification and association rule mining\224 KDD 1998 pp 80-86 K Wang S Zhou and Y He 223Growing decision tree on support-less association rules\224 KDD 2000 pp 265-269 1 pp 567 -570 115-118 583

4.1 Simulation model In the section we evaluate the performances of the three algorithms including BASIC 1121 Cumulate 12 and GMAR on a DELL PowerEdge 4400 Server with Intel" Xeon Processor and 756MB main memory running Windows 2000 server All the experimental data are generated randomly and stored on a local 30GB SCSI Disk Ultra 160 with a RAID controller The relative simulation parameters are shown in Table 1 To make our data representative, we generate two types of databases in the experiments i.e DENSE databases and SPARSE databases. Each item in the DENSE database is randomly generated from a pool P called potentially frequent itemsets with size 300 while each item in the SPARSE database is randomly generated from a pool N i.e the set of all the items\with size 1000 Since the items in the DENSE database are more clustered than those in the SPARSE database, larger frequent itemsets will probably be produced in the DENSE database for the same minimum support Besides we use the notations T for average number of items per transaction I for average number of items in a frequent itemset, and D for number of transactions. For example the experiment labeled with 7lOB.DIK represents the simulation environment with IO items on the average per transaction 3 items on the average in a frequent itemset, and 1000 transactions in total Table 1 Simulation parameters with default values ID INumber of transactions 1000-500,000 7 INumber ofthe items per transaction 15-15 P INumber of potentially frequent 1300  litemsets I I Number of the items in a frequent 12-5 4.2 Experimental results Experiment 1 In the experiment we explore the execution time of BASIC Cumulate and GMAR algorithms for the environment 7lO.L3,DIK under different minimum support and minimum confidence pairs as shown in Figure 9 In the figure, we find that our algorithm GMAR is almost faster 2-16 times than BASIC especially for larger minimum support and minimum confidence pairs whereas Cumulate is only faster 1.3-1.5 times than BASIC although R Srikant and R Agrawal claimed that Cumulate runs faster 2-5 times than BASIC 1121 In general the larger the minimum support and minimum confidence pair is the faster the execution time of the three algorithms becomes To be fair to all algorithms, we have added the extra time of generating original frequent itemsets and association rules for GMAR However the time is helow 1 of total execution time thus we do not show it in the figure h n  B a 3 i.m.26 i.ma 1.~1.3 i.mm 1.740.3 I.w Figure 9 Execution time for different pairs minimum support  Confidence Experiment 2 In the experiment we extend Experiment 1 by fixing the minimum support IS and observe their variations For the minimum support 1.5 all the algorithms except GMAR are not sensitive to the changes of the minimum confidences as shown in Figure IO The reason is that larger minimum confidences will make GMAR prune more irrelevant rules.

Both cases have the same minimum confidence 0.3 However to get comparable number of frequent itemsets, we set a smaller minimum support 1 in the SPARSE case and a larger 233 


minimum support 2 in the DENSE case As expected GMAR is still the hest one among them in the SPARSE and DENSE case especially when there are a huge amount of transactions From the both cases we find that much more frequent itemsets are generated in the DENSE database than in SPARSE database so that BASIC and Cumulate are not practicable candidates there B Ixa 8 Imo 222ixa 80 0 Imo 3033 m m loo30 number of transactions Figure 11 a Execution time for different numbers of transactions in the SPARSE database cumh?t  6 loo30  rma 2230 lorn m 5m 7cw IwD3 number of transactions Figure 1 l.\(b Execution time for different numbers of transactions in the DENSE database 5 Conclusions In the paper we try to find the association rules between the items at different levels in the taxonomy tree under the assumption that original frequent itemsets and association rules have already been generated beforehand The primary challenge is how to make use of the original frequent itemsets and association rules to directly generate new generalized association rules rather than rescanning the database In the proposed algorithm GMAR we use join methods and pruning techniques to generate new generalized association rules Through several comprehensive experiments we find that the GMAR algorithm is much better than BASIC and Cumulate algorithms since it generates fewer candidate itemsets and furthermore prunes a large amount of irrelevant rules based on the minimum confidence 6 Acknowledgments This research was supported in part by the National Science Council Taiwan under contract NSC-90-22 13-E-224-026 7 References I R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami 223Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases,\224 Pmc ACM International Conference on Mananement of Data  1993 pp 207-216 121 R Anrawal and R Srikant 223Fast Alaorithms for Mmine Adsociation Rules,\224 Pmc 2Vh Internationaiconference on Ve Large Data Bases 1994 pp 487-499 131 Yong-Jian Fu 223Data Mining,\224 IEEE Potentials Yol 16 No 4 1997 pp 18-20 141 Jia-Wei Han and Yong-Jian Fu 223Mining Multiplelevel Association Rules in Large Databases,\224 IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Yo 11 No 5 1999 pp 798-805 5 Iia-Wei Han and Micheline Kamber Data Mining Concepts and Techniques Morgan Kaufmann Publishers 2001 6 Iia-Wei Han lian Pei and Yi-Wen Yin 223Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate Generation,\224 Pmc ACM International Conference on Management o Data 2000 pp 1-12 7 Mon-Fong Jim Shian-Shyong Tseng and Shan-Yi Lia 223Data Types Generalization for Data Mining Algorithms,\224 Pmc IEEE International Conference on stems Man and Cybernetics 1999 pp 928-933 8 Bing Liu Wynne Hsu and Yi-Ming Ma 223Minin Association Rules with Multiple Minimum Supports,\224 Pmc 5 ACM International Conference on Knowledne Discovery and B DataMining 1999 pp 337-341 191 J S Park M S Cben and P S Yu 223An Effective  H&h-based Algorithm for Mining Association Rules,\224 Pmc ACM Internotional Conjerence on Mamgement o Data 1995 pp 175-186 IO A Savasere E Omiecinski, and S Navathe 223An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases,\224 P 21\224 lnternationk Conference on Very La Data Bases 1995 pp 432-443 Ill Pradeep Shenoy layant Haritsa S Sudarshan Gaurav Bhalotia, Mayank Bawa and Devavrat Shah 223Turbo-charging Vertical Mining of Large Databases,\224 Pmc ACM International Conference on Management of Data 2000 pp 22-33 I21 R Srikant and R Agrawal 223Mining Generalized Association Rules,\224 Pme 21\224 International Conference on Very Large DataBases 1995 pp 407-419 I31 S Y Sung K Wag and L.

In Figures 10 and 11 we see MAFIA is approximately four to five times faster than Depthproject on both the Connect-4 and Mushroom datasets for all support levels tested down to 10 support in Connect-4 and 0.1 in Mushroom For Connect-4 the increased efficiency of itemset generation and support counting in MAFIA versus Depthproject explains the improvement Connect 4 contains an order of magnitude more transactions than the other two datasets 67,557 transactions amplifying the MAFIA advantage in generation and counting For Mushroom the improvement is best explained by how often parent-equivalence pruning PEP holds especially for the lowest supports tested The dramatic effect PEP has on reducing the number of itemsets generated and counted is shown in Table 1 The entries in the table are the reduction factors due to PEP in the presence of all other pruning methods for the first eight levels of the tree The reduction factor is defined as  itemsets counted at depth k without PEP   itemsets counted at depth k with PEP In the first four levels Mushroom has the greatest reduction in number of itemsets generated and counted This leads to a much greater reduction in the overall search space than for the other datasets since the reduction is so great at highest levels of the tree In Figure 12 we see that MAFIA is only a factor of two better than Depthproject on the dataset Chess The extremely low number of transactions in Chess 3196 transactions and the small number of frequent 1-items at low supports only 54 at lowest tested support muted the factors that MAFIA relies on to improve over Depthproject Table 1 shows the reduction in itemsets using PEP for Chess was about an order of magnitude lower compared to the other two data sets for all depths To test the counting conjecture we ran an experiment that vertically scaled the Chess dataset and fixed the support at 50 This keeps the search space constant while varying only the generation and counting efficiency differences between MAFIA and Depthproject The result is shown in Figure 13 We notice both algorithms scale linearly with the database size but MAFIA is about five times faster than Depthproject Similar results were found for the other datasets as well Thus we see MAFIA scales very well with the number of transactions 5.3 Effects Of Compression To isolate the effect of the compression schema on performance experiments with varying rebuilding threshold values we conducted The most interesting result is on a scaled version of Connect-4, displayed in Figure 14 The Connect-4 dataset was scaled vertically three times so the total number of transactions is approximately 200,000 Three different values for rebuilding-threshold were used 0 corresponding to no compression 1 compression immediately and all subsequent operations performed on compressed bitmaps\and an optimized value determined empirically We see for higher supports above 40 compression has a negligible effect but at the lowest supports compression can be quite beneficial e.g at 10 support compression yields an improvement factor of 3.6 However the small difference between compressing immediately and finding an optimal compression point is not so easily explained The greatest savings here is only 11 at the lowest support of Conenct-4 tested We performed another experiment where the support was fixed and the Connect-4 dataset was scaled vertically The results appear in Figure 15 The x-axis shows the scale up factor while the y-axis displays the running times We can see that the optimal compression scales the best For many transactions \(over IO6 the optimal re/-threshold outperforms compressing everywhere by approximately 35 In any case both forms of compression scale much better than no compression Compression on Scaled ConnectAdata Compression Scaleup Connectldata ALL COMP 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Min Support  Scaleup Factor Figure 14 Figure 15 45 1 


6 Conclusions We presented MAFIA an algorithm for finding maximal frequent itemsets Our experimental results demonstrate that MAFIA consistently outperforms Depthproject by a factor of three to five on average The breakdown of the algorithmic components showed parent-equivalence pruning and dynamic reordering were quite beneficial in reducing the search space while relative compressiodprojection of the vertical bitmaps dramatically cuts the cost of counting supports of itemsets and increases the vertical scalability of MAFIA Acknowledgements We thank Ramesh Agarwal and Charu Aggarwal for discussing Depthproject and giving us advise on its implementation We also thank Jayant R Haritsa for his insightful comments on the MAFIA algorithm and Jiawei Han for providing us the executable of the FP-Tree algorithm This research was partly supported by an IBM Faculty Development Award and by a grant from Microsoft Research References I R Agarwal C Aggarwal and V V V Prasad A Tree Projection Algorithm for Generation of Frequent Itemsets Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing special issue on high performance data mining to appear 2000 2 R Agrawal T Imielinski and R Srikant Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases SIGMOD May 1993  R Agrawal R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc of the 20th Int Conference on Very Large Databases Santiago Chile, Sept 1994  R Agrawal H Mannila R Srikant H Toivonen and A 1 Verkamo Fast Discovery of Association Rules Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Chapter 12 AAAVMIT Press 1995 5 C C Aggarwal P S Yu Mining Large Itemsets for Association Rules Data Engineering Bulletin 21 1 23-31 1 998 6 C C Aggarwal P S Yu Online Generation of Association Rules.
