Direct Interesting Rule Generation Jiuyong Li Department of Mathematics and Computing The University of Southern Queensland Australia 4350 jiuyong@usq.edu.au Yanchun Zhang School of Computer Science and Mathematics Victoria University Australia 8001 yzhang@csm.vu.edu.au Abstract An association rule generation algorithm usually generates too many rules including a lot of uninteresting ones Many interestingness criteria are roposed to prune those uninteresting rules However they work in post-pruning process and hence do not e the rule generation ef\243ciency In this paper e discuss properties of informative rule set and conclude that the informative rule set includes 
all interesting rules measured by many commonly used interestingness criteria and that rules excluded by the informative rule set are forwardly prunable i.e they can be moved in the rule generation process instead of post pruning Based on these properties we propose a Direct Interesting rule Generation algorithm DIG to directly generate interesting rules de\243ned by any of 12 interestingness criteria discussed in this paper We further show experimentally that DIG is faster and uses less memory than Apriori 1 Introduction Data mining is a growing research area due to the increasing popularity of dealing with a large number of data in various 243elds We can obtain bene\243ts when understanding data in a meaningful form rather than a collection of 
tedious alphanumeric symbols Association rule discovery has been a central issue in data mining because of the simplicity of the problem statement and the ef\243ciency of pruning by support However an association rule generation algorithm may generate too many rules and selecting interesting rules is a big task Many interesting criteria are proposed to select userinteresting rules r they are usually used in the post pruning process hence do not improve the ef\243ciency of rule generation In this paper we prove that the informative rule set includes all interesting rules according to 12 interestingness criteria We further propose a direct algorithm to generate interesting rules and show experimentally that the proposed 
algorithm is faster and uses less memory than Apriori DIG improves interesting rule discovery ef\243ciency without more memory consumption and works on both transactional and relational data sets 2 Informative rule set and its properties An association rule set is de\243ned by the minimum support and the minimum con\243dence constraints A lot of rules satisfying these constraints are not interesting One major reason is that many rules are redundant r example a 001 z  ab 001 z and abc 001 z carry the similar message Why do we need those complex ones having long antecedents A complex rule covers a subset of instances 
covered by its simple form rules so it has to provide something more than the simple form rules to be interesting This extra provided by the complex rules is to be measured by an interestingness criterion In the context of classic association rules we expect that they ave higher con\243dence than their simple form rules Based on these observations we de\243ne the informative rule set as follows Given a set of items I   i 1 i 2 i m   and a collection of transactions D   T 
1 T 2 T n   where T i 002 I  i 001 n  D is called a transactional data set An itemset is a subset of I  and is called a l itemset if it contains l items The support for itemset S is its occurrence probability in D  denoted by P  S   S 001 q is called a rule if P  Sq  
001 1 and P  q  S  P  q   where 001 is called the minimum support and P  q  S  P  Sq  P  S  is called the con\243dence of the rule n wo rules S 003 i q and V 003 i q where S 002 V  
we say the latter is more speci\243c than the former or the former is more general than the latter 1 For simplicity in the rest of this paper we use upper case letters e.g S V Z  to stand for itemsets and ower case letters e.g a b c p q to stand for items We abbreviate S 001 q as Sq  Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


De\243nition 1 We call a rule set the informative rule set f it satis\243es the following two conditions 1 it contains all rules that satisfy the minimum support and 2 it excludes all more speci\243c rules with no greater con\243dence than one of its more general form rule In the above de\243nition we did not specify the minimum con\243dence constraint We suppose that a user may impose another minimum interestingness threshold since the discussion in this paper is to generate general interesting rules The informative rule set s de\243ned in our previous work and we concluded that it is the smallest subset of an association rule set aving the same predictive power as the association rule set based on a con\243dence priority predictive model 12 In this paper  w e r e v eal its general practical implication Theorem 1 Rules excluded by the informative rule set are uninteresting measured by many interestingness criteria namely odd ratio lift interest or strength gain addedvalue Klosgen conviction p-s Laplace estimate accuracy cosine certainty factor and Jaccard Proof In this proof we use AX 001 c to stand for a more speci\243c form rule of A 001 c  AX 001 c is excluded by the informative rule set because of P  c  AX  004 P  c  A  We will prove that by all criteria listed above rule AX 001 c is ranked lower than rule A 001 c and hence is uninteresting When two rules have the same value by an interesting metric the shorter rule is ranked higher We also know that P  A  005 P  AX   Odds ratio is a classic statistical metric to measure the association between events odd-ratio  A 001 c  P  Ac  P  254 A 254 c  P  254 A  c  P  A 254 c  the de\243nition of 254 c can be referred to the paragraph before Lemma 1 in this section We rewrite the odd ratio by support and con\243dence as follow odd-ratio  A 001 c  P  c  A  1 212 P  c  A   P  c 254 A  1 212 P  c 254 A   Since P  c  A  005 P  c  AX   P  c  A  1 212 P  c  A  005 P  c  AX  1 212 P  c  AX   Now e need to prove that P  c 254 A  1 212 P  c 254 A  004 P  c 254  AX  1 212 P  c 254  AX  to get odd-ratio A 001 c  005 odd-ratio  AX 001 c   To reach this goal we need to prove that P  c 254 A  004 P  c 254  AX

rule set to facilitate the design of an ef\243cient rule generation algorithm We do not provide proofs here and please refer to  for details We introduce a special item 254 q  which appears in all transactions where q does not occur Itemset 254  ab  means both a and b do not occur in a transaction and hence 254  ab  254 a 254 b  One obvious usefulness of this special item is to separate the support of an itemset into two parts e.g P  S  P  S 254 q  P  Sq  and P  S 254 q  P  S  212 P  Sq   or P  q  P  254 Sq  P  Sq  and P  254 Sq  P  q  212 P  Sq   In the following lemma we use Sp 001 q to denote a more speci\243c form rule of S 001 q  All more speci\243c form rule of Sp 001 q is SZp 001 q for Z 007  b  p q  t Z and S 007  Z  Lemma 1 If P  S 254 q  P  Sp 254 q   then for any item q rule Sp 001 q and all its more speci\243c form rules do not occur in the informative rule set The meaning of this lemma is very clear If a more speci\243c rule r does not reduce negative instances from one of its more general form rule then all more speci\243c rules of r will not reduce negative instance from at least one of its more general form rules Hence they are all excluded from the informative rule set For example if P  a 254 q  P  ab 254 q   then P  q  ab  004 P  q  a   further we also have P  q  abX  004 P  q  aX   abX 001 q will not occur in the informative rule set because aX 001 q is more general We have a look why this property is similar to the one that support has n itemset S is infrequent SZ is infrequent because of upwards closure property of infrequent itemsets This enables us to totally ignore all super itemsets of S in rule generation process Given SZq is frequent We usually have to test all rules from S 001 q to SZ 001 q where Z can be any itemset r if we observe that P  S 254 q  P  V 254 q  where V is a   S 212 1 itemset and V 002 S  then to generate interesting rules we need not to test all rules from S 001 q to SZ 001 q according to the lemma Now we have a look at a useful corollary Corollary 1 If P  S  P  Sp   then rule Sp 001 q for any q and all its more speci\243c form rules do not occur in the informative rule set Both lemma and corollary are very useful for f\243cient algorithm design 3 Direct interesting rule generation An association rule generation algorithm prunes infrequent itemsets forwardly An itemset is frequent if its support is greater than the minimum support An itemset is potentially frequent only if all its subsets are frequent and this property is used to limit the number of itemsets to be searched This is called upwards closure property of infrequent itemset and is useful for forward pruning In the process of the association rule generation con\243dence plays no role for the f\243ciency It only controls the number of rules It is well-known that an association rule generation algorithm produces too many uninteresting rules According to the previous analysis we know that those rules excluded by the informative rule set are uninteresting In addition we have upwards closure properties to forwardly prune those uninteresting rules These enable us to design ef\243cient algorithm to directly generate interesting rules

3.1 Candidate representation To facilitate the implementation of forward pruning by the lemma and the corollary e de\243ne a rule candidate as a pair of itemset target-set denoted by  S C   The targetset C is a set of items that are possible consequences of rules Initially e set S  C  We call  S 1 C 1  as a sub candidate of  S 2 C 2  if S 1 002 S 2  Equivalently  S 2 C 2  is a super candidate of  S 1 C 1   Target-set C is a sub or equal set of S and a candidate represents a number of potential rules r example candidate  abc abc  indicates three potential rules ab 001 c  ac 001 b and bc 001 a  and candidate  abc ab  indicates two potential rules ac 001 b and bc 001 a  Please note that we generate interesting single target rules as de\243ned in the previous section The l f items from target-set C is determined by the lemma and we will show this in Subsection 3.3 Usually candidate  S b  is a legal candidate We build a super candidate from its sub candidates Though there is no potential rule for candidate  abc b   but there may be rule abc 001 d  Constructing candidate  abcd d  needs candidate  abc b   Candidate  S b  is useless when no non-empty target-set super candidate can be built from it Formally given a set of items I   i 1 i 2 i m   itemset S and V where V 007  S  The target-set of candidate  S b  is p ermanently empty if there is no possibility to form rule SV 001 p  for all p and V where p t I n p t SV  o be n the informative rule set This means that itemset S and all its super itemsets could not be the antecedent of an interesting rule The existence of a candidate depends on two conditions 1 itemset S is frequent and 2 target-set C is not permanently empty The determination of frequent S is straightforward and hence we discuss how to determine of a permanently empty target-set The 243rst criterion follows the corollary Criterion 1 If P  Sp  P  S   then the target-set of candidate  SZp b  is permanently empty We know that rule Sp 001 q and all its more general form rules do not occur in the informative rule set according to the corollary We note that q can be any item so we need not to test rules from supersets of Sp  This criterion is associated with a 100 con\243dence rule If P  Sp  P  S   then P  p  S   When we know S always implies p  it is redundant to have SZp 001 q since SZ 001 q is more general For example candidate  abc b  means rule ab 001 c  ac 001 b  bc 001 a and their more speci\243c rules are not in the informative rule set For more details please refer to Subsection 3.3 r for ny q t abc  rule abc 001 q and its more speci\243c form rules may still be in the informative rule set and this is the reason for us to keep this candidate If we know sup  abc  sup  ab   then according to the corollary rule abc 001 q and all its more speci\243c form rules are not in the informative rule set Hence  abc b  is permanently empty We will present another criterion after presenting the candidate generation function 3.2 Candidate generator For easy understanding and comparison we present Candidate-generator for the informative rule set discovery in the similar y f Apriori-gen We call a candidate l candidate if its itemset is a l itemset A l candidate set includes all l candidates In the following discussions we assume all items in an itemset are in the alphabetic order Function Candidate-generator  Combining 1 for each pair of candidates  S l 212 1 p C p  and  S l 212 1 q C q  in l candidate set 2 insert candidate  S l 1 C  where S l 1  S l 212 1 pq and C  C p q  013  C q p  in the  l 1 candidate set  Pruning 3 for all S l 002 S l 1 4 let r  S l 1  S l 5 if candidate  S l C l  does not exist 6 then remove candidate  S l 1 C  and return 7 else C  C 013  C l r  8 If the target-set of  S l 1 C  is permanently empty 9 then remove the candidate We 243rst explain lines 1 and 2 Suppose that we have two candidates  abc a  and  abd ad   When we extend itemset  abc  to itemset  abcd   we should add item d to the targetset of candidate  abc a  because it is new o itemset  abc   For the same reason we add item c to the target-set of candidate  abd ad   We then intersect two extended target-sets  ad  and  acd   and put the intersection as the target-set of the new candidate The new candidate is  abcd ad  The intersection of target-sets here and in line 7 s to ensure that removed items from the target-set of a candidate r appear in the target-set of its super candidates The correctness is guaranteed by the lemma since any item l n the target-set is determined by the lemma as shown in Subsection 3.3 Then we explain line 3 o  Suppose that we have new candidate  abcd ad   It is the combination of  abc a  and  abd ad   We need to check if candidates identi\243ed by itemsets  acd  and  bcd  exist Suppose that they do exist and are  acd cd  and  bcd b   Because item a Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

The minimum interestingness threshold 004 can be set by any of 12 interestingness criteria discussed in Section 2 Two main functions are discussed in the previous subsections In the above algorithm we use rule b\001 c to prune 1candidates r example if 80 customers buy bread when they shop in a supermarket then rule g 001 bread with 75 con\243dence states nothing new Hence the rule is uninteresting Rule b\001 bread can prune those uninteresting rules One may argue that that rule egg 001 bread is interesting if it has very low con\243dence say 20 In this case we may formulate the rule as g 001\254 bread and call the rule as a negative rule Interestingness of negative rules is beyond the discussions of this paper The correctness of this algorithm is guaranteed by the completeness of enumerating all itemsets by the 243rst two lines of Candidate-generator and accurate forward pruning uninteresting rules by Lemma 1 and Corollary 1 Its time complexity is determined by the number of candidates and so is its memory usage Please note line 9 in function Candidate-generator and line 6 in function Prune not only are all super candidates of a candidate with the infrequent itemset removed but also all super candidates of a candidate with a permanently empty target-set Accordingly DIG does not generate all frequent itemsets DIG is more ef\243ciency than an association rule generation algorithm and its memory usage is smaller because it uses con\243dence to prune uninteresting rules in addition to the support pruning 4 Experimental results In this section we show the ef\243ciency of DIG in the comparison with a well-known association rule generation algorithm Apriori Though some association rules algorithms 11 19 are f aster than Apriori the y usually use more memory to trade for faster speed We note that in most applications an association rule generation algorithm fails because it runs out of the computer memory So we stick with Apriori and will compare memory usage with Apriori Two test transactional data sets T10.I6.D100K.N2K and T20.I6.D100K.N2K are generated by the synthetic data generator from QUEST of IBM Almaden research center Two data sets contain 1000 items and 100,000 transactions each Our experiments were conducted on a Dell computer with 2G memory and a 2.4GHZ Intel processor running Red Hat Linux 7.3 Apriori is implemented with the storage structure of pre\243x tree and so is DIG We 243rst examine the time ef\243ciency of DIG It s compared against Apriori The rule generation time of DIG and Apriori are listed in Figure 1 We can see that DIG is faster  0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 x 10 2123 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 The minimum support The generating time \(in sec T10.I6.D100K.N2K Apriori DIG 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 x 10 2123 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 The minimum support The generating time \(in sec T20.I6.D100K.N2K Apriori DIG Figure 1 The comparison of time ef\243ciency than Apriori and the ef\243ciency improvement is more significant when the support is low To demonstrate DIG improve ef\243ciency without any additional memory consumption we list the number of total candidates for different rule sets in Figure 2 We can see that DIG uses less memory than Apriori does We also note that the time ef\243ciency improvement is consistent with the candidate reduction DIG searches less candidates for interesting rues This is a major reason for ef\243ciency improvement When we apply DIG o relational data sets the ef\243ciency improvement is much more signi\243cant than to transactional data sets This is because a relational data set s denser than a transactional data set and the lemma and corollary are more ef\243cient in forward pruning Importantly DIG enables us to generate interesting rules in relational data with lower support than Apriori does Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

6 Conclusions In this paper we discussed properties of the informative rule set We proved that all rules excluded by the informative rule set are uninteresting by 12 interestingness criteria and that excluded rules are forwardly prunable These properties enabled us to design an ef\243cient algorithm DIG to directly generate interesting rules We showed experimentally that DIG is faster and uses less memory than Apriori DIG avoids time consuming post pruning that an algorithm to generate interesting rules through an association rule set has to undergo References  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
