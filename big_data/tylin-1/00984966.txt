4.1 Introduction and 
Background Commodity traders have a saying 223you grade it and we\222ll trade it.\224 The IEEE Standards Association IEEE-SA has recognized the need to grade and quantify greenhouse gas emission reduction credits from initiatives and projects implemented throughout the electricity industry end users and associated processes The electricity industry is a major contributor about one third to global CO2 emissions Therefore it makes good sense for the industry to develop and implement technology options to achieve cost 
effective reductions It also makes sense for the industry to develop the standard rules for quantifying emission reduction credits from such initiatives If the industry does not others will and the industry may not like the result 4.1.1 Emissions Trading The potential options to reduce emissions available to participants in different countries and companies vary greatly in magnitude and cost An effective tool or mechanism to achieve cost effective global reduction targets is the concept of emissions 
trading or transfers among participants A simple and clear description of how an international emissions trading scheme for greenhouse gases would work is given in Ref 1 Essentially this involves treating emission allowances and emission reduction credit units like any other commodity in the marketplace Arrangements would then be made for them to be traded on international exchanges The marketplace would set the value of emission credit units These would be bought and sold by countries and companies 
to facilitate meeting reduction targets at lowest cost For this to work just like any other commodity there must be internationally accepted standards or a 223common currency\224 for the measurement quantification and certification of emissions credit units Imagine the confusion today in the market trading of electricity if we did not have 223common currency\224 standards for measuring and quantifying units of electrical energy The worldwide growth in interest in emissions trading and emissions exchanges is quite 
staggering as a few hours spent surfing the intemet will prove Ref 2 gives a good summary of the status of domestic regional and international emissions trading initiatives 4.2 The IEEE Standard Proiect In August 2001 the IEEE Standards Board approved a project to develop a 223Standard for the Quantification of Emission Credits for Electrical Industry Processes\224 The project is sponsored by the IEEE Energy Development  Power Generation Committee and will be developed by the Working Group 
on Implementing Technology to Limit Climate Change The presenter is secretary and acting chair of this working group The approved scope and purpose of the Standard project are as follows 4.2.1 Scope The Standard is intended to cover the measurement and quantification of CO2 or equivalent reductions for emissions credits in the electricity supply and demand industry as brought about by technology applications innovations and improvements It will cover 223cradle to grave\224 project life-cycles in all aspects 
of the industry This includes fuel chain and processing energy conversion systems generation emission control systems pre and post combustion delivery systems transmission and distribution and end uses demand side management and conservation 4 DEVELOPING A STANDARD FOR CO2 EMISSION CREDITS Jim McConnach Secretary and Acting Chair IEEE Working Group on Implementing Technology to Limit Climate Change Ontario Canada  114 0-7803-7322-7/02/$17.00 \251 2002 IEEE 


4.2.2 Purpose The purpose of the Standard is to establish an internationally accepted basis for measuring evaluating and quantifying the eligible real measurable verifiable and unique reduction in CO2 emissions attributable to a specific technology project for use in emissions trading systems The Standard will help provide an answer to the generic question 223How can one country or jurisdiction to an emissions trade be assured and satisfied that it is getting real and true value for a purchased emission credit from another country or jurisdiction?\224 4.2.3 Schedule The project approval is open until the end of 2005 However a preliminary schedule has been developed which targets the fall of 2003 for a final draft of the Standard to go for balloting This is ambitious for an international standard of this complexity and magnitude but fits well with the timing of developments in regional and international emission trading programs 4.2.4 Participation All IEEE standards development projects are open to everyone for participation and to keep informed Openness is one of the five imperative principles of the standards process However to facilitate a fast tracking of such a complex project it is proposed to form an initial core task force to develop a strawman document for consideration by the broader audience of the working group The initial task force project roster will aim for good representation across the industry and across the world The task force membership is expected to grow as the project develops Anyone interested in joining the Working Group or participating in the project to research and develop material and/or review drafts please contact Jim McConnach at jsmccomrach@iee.org Please note you do not have to be an IEEE member to join and you can enter and leave the process at any time Much of the work can be done over the intemet via e mail However there will be a need for occasional meetings to debate and resolve key issues Task force members are expected to fund their own time and expenses 4.3 Issues There are a number of key issues which will need full and open debate for resolution in developing such a complex and politically charged international standard A few of these are listed below  Universality This issue concerns not only the scope of the project but aspects such as vested interests in existing domestic trading programs  Standardization and Certification These are generally separate activities but certification of credits will be an inherent part of quality assurance  Methodology This is likely to consume much debate both in terms of the approach to assessments and the issue of measured versus estimated quantities These and other complex issues will need to be thoroughly debated to obtain international consensus 4.4 Conclusions  115 


To facilitate international emissions trading of greenhouse gases there is a need for a universally accepted standard for the quantification and certification of CO2 emission credit units This will enable them to be traded just like any other commodity The IEEE Standards Association have approved a project for the development of such a Standard This is a complex and ambitious task and much help will be needed from the industry and others to bring it to a timely and successful completion 4.5 References 1 223Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading A Country and Company  Eye View\224 Submission by USA to UNFCC COP6 2 223Meeting the Kyoto Protocol Commitments Summary  Domestic Emissions Trading Schemes\224 January 2001 by Henrik Hasselknippe and Geir Hoibye Energy  Environment Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry Submission to UNFCC COP6 Key Web-sites for Further Study UN Framework Convention on Climate Change www.unfccc.de Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change www.ipcc.ch International Emissions Trading Association www.ieta.org Has links to National Trading Schemes and International Agency Sites Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change www.ipcc.ch The Science  Environmental Policy Project www.sepp.org Iim McConnach is Principle Consultant Castle Hill Engineering Services After a 36 year career in the electricity supply industry in the private and public sectors he is now an independent consultant offering training and special services to the industry He obtained a first class degree in Electrical Engineering from St Andrews University Scotland in 1964 He apprenticed and worked for a UK manufacturer involved in the design development and selling of specialized power transmission equipment This led to five years in international consulting in the design and planning of utility and industrial supply systems in developing countries In 1977 Jim McConnach joined Ontario Hydro in Toronto Canada to work on a wide range of projects This included strategies plans regulatory approvals and management of special projects for T&D fossil nuclear and hydroelectric generation energy efficiency and system operations He retired from Ontario Hydro in 2000 He is a registered Professional Engineer in Ontario a Fellow of the IEE UK and a Senior Member of the IEEE He is secretary and acting chair of the IEEE Working Group on Implementing Technology to Limit Climate Change Contact information Jim McConnach Castle Hill Engineering Services 25 Catharine Crescent Bracebridge Ontario Canada PlL lB2 Phone/Fax 705 645 5524 E-mail jsmcconnach@iee.org  116

In practice our algorithm computes the spf values for only a fraction of the 4 candidate pairs Figure 3 right\illustrates the frontier line for the CNN corpus We now introduce the first Word Associations Mining WAM\algorithm The MATRIX-WAM algorithm shown in Figure 4.2 implements matrix mining The first step makes apass overthecorpusand coilectsterm statistics. The pruning step performs both high and low end pruning as de scribed in Section 4.1 For each term we store an occur rence list keeping all sentences the term appears in For a pair z y we can compute the spf z y by going through the occurrence lists of the two terms 12 check the column frontier and determine the pairs to be stored For higher order associations the algorithm performs multiple matrix mining passes In the ith pass one axis of the matrix holds the idf values as before, and the other axis the mi-l values of the i  1 that survived the pre vious pass We use threshold 8 for the ith pass 43 Shortened documents While matrix mining reduces the computation signifi cantly, there are still many pairs for which we compute the spf value. Furthermore for most of these pairs the spf value is actually zero so we end up examining many more pairs than the ones that actually appear in the corpus We invoke a different approach similar to the AprioriTID algorithm de scribed by Agrawal and Srikant 2 Let H1 denote the set of terms that survive the pruning steps described in Section 4.1  we call these the interesting terms Given HI we make a second pass over the corpus keeping a counter for each pair of interesting terms that appear together in a sentence Collect rem SIaliStiCS Hi t Rune Terms CI  Corpus Fori  2 10 k For each sentence J in Ci-1 I  i l SI  i-tuples generated by joining I with iuelf Add luples in s to Hi if 3  0 Add 3 to C H t apply pruning on Hi Figure 5 The SHORT-WAM algorithm That is we replaced each document by a shortened docu ment consisting only of the terms deemed interesting The shortened documents algorithm extends naturally for higher order associations \(Figure 4.3 The algorithm per forms multiple passes overthe data The input to the ith pass is a corpus C;L that consists of sentences that are sets of i 1 ahash tahleHj-1 thatstoresall interesting i 1 An i-tuplel isinterestingifmi\(t  8 Dur ing the ith pass the algorithmgenerates candidate i-tuples by joining interesting i  1 that appear together in a sentence The join operation between i  1 is per formed as in the case of the a priori algorithms 21 The can didates are stored in a hash Hi and each sentence is replaced by the candidates it generates At the end of the pass the al gorithm outputs a corpus Ci that consists of sentences that are collections of i-tuples Furthermore we apply low end pruning to the hash table Hj using threshold 8i At the end of the pass Hi contains the interesting i-tuples Figure 6 Pruned Terms for CNN corpus 4.4 Empirical study of WAM algorithms We ran ourtwo algorithmsonour threecorpora applying both high and low end pruning.

optimization for larger transaction sizes and in cases where there are large number of candidate k itemsets 6 Conclusions In this paper e presented a parallel implementation of the Apriori algorithm on the SGI Power Challenge shared memory multi-processor We also discussed a set of optimizations which include optimized join and pruning computation balancing for candidate generation hash tree balancing and short-circuited subset checking We then presented experimental results on each of these Improvements of more than 40 were obtained for the computation and hash tree balancing The short-circuiting optimization was found to be extremely effective for databases with large transaction sizes Finally we reported the parallel performance of the algorithm While we d good speed-up we observed a need for parallel I/O techniques for further performance gains References  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Database mining A performance perspecti v e  I n IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engg  pages 5\(6 1993  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in lar ge databases In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1993  R Agra wal H Mannila R Srikant H T o i v onen and A I V erkamo F ast disco v ery of association rules In U F et al editor Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  MIT Press 1996  R Agra wal and J Shafer  P arallel mining of association rules design implementation and e xperience Technical Report RJ10004 IBM Almaden Research Center San Jose CA 95120 Jan 1996  R Agra wal and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Proc 20th VLDB Conf  Sept 1994  M Cierniak W  Li and M J Zaki Loop scheduling for heterogeneity  I n 4th IEEE Intl Symposium on High-Performance Distributed Computing also as URCS-TR 540 CS Dept Univ f Rochester  Aug 1995  M Holsheimer  M  K ersten H Mannila and H T o i v onen A perspecti v e on databases and data mining In 1st Intl Conf Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  Aug 1995  M Houtsma and A Swami Set-oriented mining of association rules In RJ 9567  IBM Almaden Oct 1993  H Mannila H T o i v onen and I V erkamo Ef 336cient algorithms for disco v ering association rules In AAAI Wkshp Knowledge Discovery in Databases  July 1994  J S P ark M Chen and P  S Y u  A n e f fecti v e hash based algorithm for mining association rules In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1995 17 Proceedings of the 1996 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing \(SC\22296 0-89791-854-1/96 $ 10.00 ACM
