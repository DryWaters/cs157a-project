from audit data In this paper we describe another extension that uses frvy frequent episodes for near real-time intrusion detection We lirst define fuzzy frequent episodes and then describe experiments that explore their applicability for real time intrusion detection Experimental results indicate that fuzzy frequent episodes can provide effeclive approrimate anomaly detection I INTRODUCTION The pervasiveness of computer networks in modem life and recent high-profile attacks against major Internet sites have prompted wide interest in improved security of computer networks including better methods for intrusion detection Approaches to network intrusion detection are typically categorized as misuse detection or anomaly detection Misuse detection systems look for known patterns of attack while anomaly detection systems look for deviations from normal behavior A variety of data mining methods 
have been used in an attempt to automate the acquisition of patterns for both misuse and anomaly detection Many research groups now advocate the fusion of information from a number of different detection modules e.g 2 41 We describe on anomaly detection approach based on fuzzy frequent episodes that can provide evidence of intrusions in near real-time Frequent episodes have been used by several research groups to represent frequent sequential patterns in temporal data streams 14 61 When the sequential patterns involve quantitative values some sort of quantization is used to yield discrete attribute values The quantization process can produce an artificial sharp boundary problem Kuok Fu and Wong 3 addressed this problem for association rule mining by developing methods for mining fuzzy association rules 
We have extended their approach to mine fuzzy frequent episodes SI In our previous work we have used fizzy association NICS and fuzzy frequent episodes for off-line anomaly detection In this paper we explore the applicability of fuzzy frequent episodes for near real-time intrusion detection from network audit data We first present a brief overview of frequent episodes and then describe our fuzzy extension to this data mining method We then describe our method for real-time intrusion detection using fuzzy frequent episodes and present preliminary experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach 11 THEORY F\222requent Episodes hkmila and ToivCnen 6 desoibed an algaitlnn to dismver mhninal aanmuxs In Mamila

This allows an event variable e to be expressed as ek\(attrl=cl attr2=c  attrk=c where ek\(attrl=cl ,attr2=c  atlrk=c G A and for all j 1 s j a k 1 5 cj S f\(aJ We define two event variables B\(attrl  c1 attrz=c 2,...,attrp=cp and eQ\(attrl  cl,attr2'=c2  attrq'=cq to be homogeneous if B.attrl,S.attrz  B.attrp  e'.attr1;eq.ottr2  eq.attr,7 which also indicates that p  q It is obvious that an event variable is homogeneous to itself Given an event E=\(E.ar E.a2 __ E.ad E.aj I Sj Sm  represents a value of the jh attribute and can be mapped to ma I E.aj 1 for all I 1 C  S f\(ajj However if aj is fuzzy, the sum of all the memberships may not always equal one A normalization nrocess is used as follows 0 4 maj 1 E.aj if ai is categorical For an event variable ek\(attrl=cl attr2=c2  attrk=c where 1 5 k a m its occurrence in E is no longer restricted to the values 0 or I Rather it is defined as k occurrence\(e E  nrn'Z,,,,\(ek.c E.\(e'.attr The minimal occurrence of an episode is the product of the occurrences of its event variables This means an event E may support several event variable occurrences due to the introduction of fuzzy sets However a side effect may arise due to very small membership values For example, consider the event sequence Ei E2 Ej within the window threshold A B C and D are event variables in which A and B are homogeneous but A L B and C and D are homogeneous but C  D Suppose we have the following occurrences of the event variables 1-1 occurrence\(A,E  0.8 occurrence\(B,EJ  0.2 occurrence\(A  0.1 occurrence\(B  0.9 occurrence\(C,E3  0.9 and occurrence\(D,E3  0.1 Then the minimal occurrence of episode 64 C will become 0.09 based on A,E3.C} and not 0.72 that would be the value based on the non-minimal event sequence EI.A,E3.C This means that the occurrence of an event variable with a very small membership may change the minimal occurrence ofan episode in the event sequence To address this problem we introduce another user specified tbreshold minoccurrence to represent the smallest allowable occurrence of an event variable So given an event variable ek if occurrence\(ek,E it will not be considered to have occurred in E The following normalization process will conducted to account for the deletion of these low membership occurrences if occurrence\(e",E  leastoccurence else occurrence\(e',E O occurence\(ek E zeq occurenc<eq E occurrence\(e",E Here every eq is homogeneous to ek and occurrence\(eq,E Z minoccurrence For instance if leastoccurrence  0.2 EI will contribute 0.8 to A and 0.2 to 8 E2 will contribute 1 to B and E3 will contribute 1 to C If enstoccurrence is set above 0.5 for any event only one event variable will he counted with a normalized occurrence of one Other than the difference in calculating the frequency or minimal occurrence of an episode the algorithm for mining fuzzy frequency episodes is similar to Mannila and Toivonen's algorithm 6 for mining frequent episodes More details are available in 5 111 REAL TIME MTRUSION DETECTION Lee Stolfo and Mok 4 describe the use of frequent episodes to select features that will be significant for construction of real-time intrusion detection systems We have previously described the use of fuzzy frequent episodes 369 


in a similar fashion 5 In addition, we have investigated the use of fuzzy episode rules directly for near real-time intrusion detection In the Time-based Inductive Machine TIM proposed by Teng Chen and Lu 7 a sequential pattern with 100 certainty can be used to detect anomalies For example given a normal pattern like A  B  C  D=IOO the sequence A  B  C  E will he marked as an anomaly since it is believed that A  B  C is always followed by D In a similar fashion we introduce the idea of using fuzzy episode rules with high confidence e.g 20.8 for anomaly detection Consider the event sequence S={EI,EI.....E.~.I the current event E following S and a fuzzy episode rule of the form R el  e*.I-%,c,s,w where k 2 1 andallei\(I _Ci_Ck areevent variables For the episode e  Q if its minimum occurrence in S is x x  O it then can be predicted with confidence c that el,...ek-l,ek will also have a minimal occurrence in S+\(EnE.J with the constraint that e'occurs in the event E  Suppose the minimal occurrence of the episode in the sequence S+{E.J is y y/x Z c should also hold In this case event E is said to match the episode rule R On the other hand like TIM if the episode el  ek.j has no minimum occurrence in S or if x  0 the episode rule R is said to be mismatched and indicates an anomaly Our experiments demonstrate that a large window threshold \(e.g 15 seconds a w L 30 seconds decreases the probability of mismatches The set of episode rules mined from training data is used to represent normal patterns If the current event E does not match any episode rule, it will be marked as an anomaly with some degree of belief The confidence of an episode rule is usually less than 1 and provides a measure of the strength of the evidence of an anomaly This approximate intrusion detection method evidence for anomalies that can be combined with evidence from other detection modules IV WENMENTAL RESULTS The experiments described in this section were designed to demonstrate the applicability of fuzzy episode rules in real time intrusion detection In the first experiment, intrusions of the probing type were simulated by use of mscan m the network of the Computer Science Department of Mississippi State University. Mscan is a software tool which can be used to scan multiple systems Fuzzy episode rules were mined from 3 hours of training data with no intrusions for the feature of PN the number of different destination ports during last 2 seconds Since the simulated intrusions usually take 1 to 1.5 minutes test data sets were established by collecting network traffic data for 3 minutes, with the goal of covering the duration of every simulated inhusion Six test data sets were collected during 13:0&14:00 Tuesday 30 March 1999 and 13:o\(t-14:00 Wednesday 31 March 1999 Among the six test data sets, TI TZ and T3' represent normal data sets and T4 T5 and T6 represent data sets with simulated mscan intrusions. The anomaly percentage of every test data set is calculated as follows Suppose we are given a sequence of n events for testing An event will be marked as an anomaly if in the set of episode rules representing normal behavior there is no episode rule that it matches If the total number of anomaly events ism m n anomalypercenfage   100 Figure 1 shows results of the first experiment Rule sets were mined using minconfidence  0.8 minsupporf  0.1 minoccurrence  0.3 and window  15s Test Data Sets Fig 1 Anomaly Percentages of Different Test Data Sets These results demonstrate clear differences in the anomaly percentages of normal data and intrusion data Since there are no simulated intrusions in TI TZ and T3 the anomaly percentages for this data actually represent false positive error rates Further analysis of the results from T4 T5 and T6 shows that all have false positive error rates below 10 However the false regative error rates are relatively high about 40 There are several reasons First only one feature is PN is used Second, the simulated intrusions are not evenly distributed along time according to this feature A second experiment was conducted in order to compare the intrusion detection performance especially the false positive error rate between fuzzy episode rules and non fuzzy episode rules by use of intervals The same training data set and six test data sets as in the first were used Both fuzzy episode rules and non-fuzzy episode rules were mined from training data for the feature of PN the number of different destination ports during last 2 seconds which was divided into three fuzzy sets \(for fuzzy episode rules or three intervals for non-fuzzy episode rules LOW MEDIUM and HIGH Figure 6.10 shows a comparison of the false positive error rates on test data sets between fuzzy episode rules and non-fuzzy episode rules The experimental results demonstrate that the false positive error rates from fuzzy episode rules are less than for non fuzzy episode rules That is to say, the error rate of predicting a normal behavior as an intrusion is much lower for fuzzy episode rules than non-fuzzy episode rules 370

for the unknown users if this approach is taken for parameter estimation Since the difference between the recommended method and 336xed component distribution parameter method is negligible and optimizing the 003 k 325s for maxent is too time consuming we chose 336xing these parameters to conduct our experiments 4 Visualization and Interpretation As mentioned earlier each component of a mixture model can be viewed as a cluster representing a certain pattern present in the data The resulting model represents each session as a weighted combination of these clusters n the observed

each cluster is important for a number of tasks such s managing the site targeted advertising identifying malicious visitors It also helps understanding the navigation patterns of different user groups and therefore helps in organizing the site to better suit the users Visualizing the users\325 behavior also makes it possible to identify and provide customized services like customized help and recommendations 5 Data Description and Preprocessing Our data set consists f CiteSeer log 336les covering a period of approximately two months The log 336les are a series of transaction in the

preprocessing the data is aggregating the transactions by user id and breaking them into sessions We use time oriented heuristics to recognize new sessions r a d user id we de\336ne a session as a sequence of actions with no two consecutive actions more than 300 seconds apart If a user is inactive for more than 300 seconds his/her next action is considered as the start of a ew session Next we identify robots and discard sessions belonging to them We examine the histogram of number of accesses in one session to recognize robots Users who access the archive more than some threshold in one session are labeled as robots After removing the robot sessions we collapse the same consecutive actions into a single instance of that action and discard sessions which contain only one action We chronologically partitioned the data into 1,720,512 training sessions and 430,128 test sessions The total number of actions in the training data is 12,200,965 and in test data this number is 3,853,108 The average number of sessions per user is 7 in the training data and 9 in the test data The preprocessed data is represented as a collection of ordered sequences of user actions where each sequence is labeled with a user id Test data includes 54,429 users out of which only 8139 of the users were seen in the training data also Since the model proposed in this paper uses the global model for the

won\325t e seen clearly in the results for all the users We therefore report the results on the revisiting users and give the results for the whole data if there are any major differences between the two cases 6 Experimental Results and Comparisons We evaluated the user behavior models based on the accuracy f their predictions and visualized the user behavior clusters to demonstrate the descriptive ability of the models Prediction accuracy is evaluated by scanning the user sessions and for each action in the session predicting the identity of the following action In our experiments we compare mixtures of position speci\336c PS maximum entropy models mixtures of non position speci\336c non-PS maximum entropy models and mixtures of Markov models r maximum entropy models the length of the history s set to 5 Our main criteria for prediction evaluation is the hit ratio  which is the ratio of the correct predictions to the total number of predictions made The predictions made by the mixture models are actually lists of ranked actions where the ranking is done by ordering the actions by their probability values If the system were to predict only one action the 336rst action on the ranked list would be chosen r the quality of the remaining predictions is also an indication of the success of the model Therefore we take the 336rst N predictions on the list and evaluate the performance of the models based on the success of these N predictions for N 1   5  10 In this case a hit occurs if the true action is predicted in any f these N guesses We also report the likelihoods of the models on the test data since it\325s our optimization criteria and is another indication of how well the model represents the data Table  Hit ratio results on known users for 3 component

and non-PS speci\336c maxent models\325 hit ratios are very close to each other but non-PS model performed better than the PS in the 10-component mixture model and for N 002 2 in 3-component mixture model An interesting point about the non-PS maxent model is the altitude of the ffect of personalization on it Although the PS model is better in all test cases for the global models personalization s the non-PS model more such that it\325s able to beat the PS model As follows from the tables personalized Markov mixture model has the highest hit ratio for the known users r non-PS maxent s able to perform better for N 002 2 in the 3-component model This result may seem surprising considering the fact that 336rst order Markov models are making use of only bigrams whereas maxent models are using triggers in addition to bigrams t it\325s not The goal of maximum entropy is to choose the most general model within the set of functions satisfying the constraints Markov models on the other hand do not have this property and thus may 336t the training data better The advantage of maxent models can be seen more clearly when looked at the results for all users Table 4 and Table 5 present the hit ratios of the personal models for 3-component and 10component mixture models respectively Non-PS maxent outperforms Markov model for all prediction list lengths t 4 in 3-component mixture model and it performs worse only for N 3  4  5 in the 10-component mixture model In Table 6 we report the likelihood of the personalized models for the test data Best likelihood is d by Markov mixture model and non-PS maxent mixture follows it PS maxent mixture performs even worse when the number of components is increased As discussed in Section 4 e are also interested in the interpretation of the user

dictive model for representing user behaviors and a useful mechanism for identifying and interpreting user behavior patterns for the Web data 7 Conclusions and Future Work We described a mixture model based approach to generating and visualizing individual behavior models for CiteSeer users We represented the Web data as a collection of ordered action sequences for each user We introduced a maximum entropy based approach for modeling the user behavior motivated by its ability to model long term dependencies in data sequences In addition to maxent model we also investigated the use of 336rst order Markov mixture models We demonstrated that both methods are able to generate strong predictive models with different strengths and weaknesses Markov model performed better for predicting the behavior of the known users whereas maximum entropy model was better at modeling the global behavior model and therefore the unknown users also We used a simple method to achieve personalization yet managed to avoid the insuf\336cient data problem of traditional personalization techniques By using mixture model based clustering we were able to identify and visualize speci\336c behavior patterns of CiteSeer users where it s demonstrated that maximum entropy model\325s computational cost pays off t recognizing complex dominant patterns of user behavior We plan to expand our work on identifying speci\336c user behavior patterns and provide customized services for instance customized recommendations for each of the behavior model groups We are also interested in naming these groups of users We intend to perform real-time experiments on CiteSeer with our maximum entropy based predictive model We are also planning to apply our personalization algorithm to mixtures of hidden Markov models and compare it with the maxent model proposed in this paper 8 Acknowledgements This work has been partially supported by a grant from Lockheed Martin We would like to thank Steve Lawrence for making

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
