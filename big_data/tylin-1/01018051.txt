A SAR-Based Interesting Rule Mining Algorithm Jiexun Li and Guoqing Chen School of Economics and Management Tsinghua University Beijing P R China I00084 Qijxl chengq tsinghua edu en Abstract Association rule mining is one of the most important fie in data mining Rules explosion is a problem of concern as conventional mining algorithms often produce too many rules for decision makers to digest This paper discusses how to mine interesting rules with the antecedent constraint being 
positively associated with the consequent. Notions of simple association rules SAR interestingness measures and antecedent constraints are incorporated in the process of interesting rules discovery The entire set of interesting rules can be derivedjom the simple rules without any information loss and the proposed SAR-based mining algorithm performs better than conventional methods by reducing the number of ct.rzdidate rules 1 Introduction Association rule mining one of the important areas of data mining, is meant to discover the association between different attributes in large databases l For a given transaction database T let 
I  Ii i=l,...,m be a set of literals, called items An association rule can be regarded as a relationship in forms of XaY where X and Y are two sets of items hereafter referred to as itemsets XnY=0 Two measures, namely the Degree of Support Dsupp\and the Degree of Confidence Dconf\are used to define a rule A rule XsY can be obtained if Dsupp\(X3Y  llXYll IT1 2 Min-supp and Dconf\(X=Y  llXYll  llX/l 1 Min-conf where llXll is 
the number of transactions that contain X IT1 is the total number of transactions in database T Min-supp and Min-conf are MD given thresholds In this paper the set of all rules satisfying the thresholds is denoted as Y Y  r XzY I X Y c I and XnY  0 Dsupp\(r 1 Min-supp Dconqr 2 Min-conf  In accordance with this the basic Apriori algorithm was introduced and often regarded as a conventional method 2 
However association rule miners often generate thousands of rules that cannot easily be handled or digested directly by decision makers which leads to the concems of rule interestingness Existing studies on interestingness have addressed a variety of issues and concems 1 Many interestingness measures have been defied upon different semantics to represent the relationship inherent between the antecedent and the consequent of a rule such as gain, laplace l influence conviction and improvement 3 8-91 2 Item constraints could be incorporated into the rule generation process so as to derive certain forms 
of rules more effectively IO 3 The simplicity is an important aspect of interestingness For example simple association rules were introduced to eliminate redundant information 4-51 4 Another direction is to extend the notion of association rules giving rise to various extensions such as generalized association rules  1 11 quantitative associatior rdes  121 fuzzy association rules 6-71 Although each of these studies focused on a specific aspect of interestingness few efforts incorporated various aspects of interestingness together into the process of rule mining Practically decision makers might only be concerned about rules 
with the antecedent constraint positively associated with the consequent. For instance a storekeeper wants to discover interesting rules in the form of 223P and   Q meaning that the customers who at least bought P also bought Q where P was positively associated with Q Such focused rules, concerning several semantics of interestingness, can be found from all the rules generated by conventional mining methods Of course it will be desirable if the available information could be incorporated into the rule generation process so as to derive the rules more effectively 
in accordance with these concems, interestingness measures item constraints and the ideas of simple association rules are co,.*;idered in the process of mining interesting rules with given antecedent constraints in this paper 2 Problem statement and definitions 2.1 Interestingness measure  Partly supported by 223Nation\222s Outstanding Young Scientists Funds\224 of China No 79925001 and the Bilateral Scientific and Technological Cooperation Programme Between China and Flandres 1 74B0201 0-7803-7461 4/02/$17.00 0 2002 IEEE 178 


Lift, a well-known interestingness measure, represents a test of statistical independence 13 and can be used to evaluate a rule in terms of the relationship between the antecedent and the consequent Definition 1 Given X Y c I XnY  0 DconflX  Y Lift\(X a Y  DSUPP\(Y Furthermore, Conditional Lift is defined to represent the relationship between subsets of items in the antecedent and the consequent Definition 2 Given X Y Z c I XnY  0 YnZ  0 xnz  0 Dconf\(XY Z Dconf\(Y Z Lift\(X I XY a Z   For Lift\(P 1 X3Y with Pfl if LifC-1 then the subset of itemset in the antecedent is positively associated with the consequent if Lifkl then it is independent of the consequent and if Lift<l then it is negatively associated with the consequent For instance given rule rl 223Beer and Mea Diaper with Dsupp=15 DconF70%\222 and r2: \223Beer 5 Diaper with Dsupp=20 DconF80 we have that 223Meat is negatively associated with 223Diaper\224 for Lift\(\223Milk\224lrl Dconf\(rz\then rl is regarded to be uninteresting 2.2 Interesting association rules Prior to defming the interesting association rules, some properties of association rules are worth notirig Lemma 1 Given X Y Z P c I XnY  0 YnZ  0 xnz  0 PsX 1 Dsupp\(X3YZ  Dsupp\(XY=S  Dsupp\(XZ3Y 2 Dconf\(X3YZ  DconflXsY XY-Z  DconflX=Z XZaY 3 Lift\(P I X=YZ  Lift\(P I X*Y P I XYsZ  Lift\(P I XaZ P I XZaY Proof 1 According to the definition of Dsupp we have Dsupp\(X3YZ  Dsupp\(XYZ  Dsupp\(XY2Z  Dsupp\(XZ=Y 2 According to the definition of Dconf we have  Dsupp\(XY Dconf\(XY a Z  DconfO  Y  DconfO\(Y a Z By exchanging Y and Z we obtain Dconf\(X*YZ  DconflX5Z DSUPP\(X 3 According to the definition of Lift and Conditional Lift we have Dconf\(X  YZ DconQG  P 3 YZ Lift\(P 1 X 9 YZ  U Theorem 1 Given X Y Y\222 P c I XnY  0 PG Y\222cY for a rule r XaY if there exists a rule h XaY\222 where such that Lift\(P I h then there exists a rule 6 XY\222=\(Y-Y\222 such that 1 Dsupp\(5  Dsupp\(r 2 DconflE 2 Dconflr and 3 Lift\(P I 5 2 Lift\(P I r Proof According to lemma 1 we have 1 Dsupp\(6  Dsupp\(XY  Dsupp\(r 2 Mh-supp 2 Since Dconflr  DconflX-Y  DconflXaY\222  Dconf\(XY\222=\(Y-Y\222  Dconf\(h C and Dconf E 0 11 we have Dconf\(6 2 Dconflr 2 Min-cone 3 Since PI X=Y P\(X-Y\222 PlXY\222=\(Y-Y\222 and Lift\(P1 XaY\222 Lift\(Plh we have Lift\(P I 200 2 Lift\(P I r 0 According to Theorem 1 rule 5 contains the same items as rule r does. Furthermore, Dsupp, Dconf and Lift of 5 are greater than those of r Therefore 6 expresses the information about the relationship among itemset XY in a more interesting way Thus r should be filtered out as a redundant rule Furthermore interesting rules with antecedent constraint P Pd being positively associated with the consequent, can be defined as follows Definition 3 Given X Y P c I XnY  0 Min-supp and Min-conf rule r X-Y is an interesting association rule with antecedent constraint P if 2 Dsupp\(r  Dsupp\(X=Y  Dsupp\(XY 1 Min-supp 3 Dconflr  Dconf\(X3Y 2 Min-conf 4 For any rule r\222 X-Y\222 where Y\222sY Lift\(Plr\222 P 1\p E x I X=Y\222 From the perspectives of novelty and correlation both interestingness measures and antecedent constraints are incorporated in the process of rules discovery.

For example assuming the data in Table 1 and the minimum support s is 2, we can extract the sequential pattern 23->38->49, i.e. users often tend to visit 23, then 38, followed by 49  t  User ID URL 1 5 23 49 1 <5 38 1 5 45 49 2 <23 2 <19 38 2 23 47 49   Extracting sequential patterns typically needs much more computational power than finding association rules The sequential discovery techniques we use involve 4 phases 001\002 Phase 1 finds the frequent item sets from the data sequences. This is almost identical to finding association rules. However, each item set is only counted once for every user. Therefore, although item 5 appears 3 times for user 1, it is only counted as appearing once 001\002 Phase 2 enumerates all the frequent items sets 1: <23 2: <38 3: <49 4: <23 49 001\002 Phase 3 transforms the original data sequences by replacing the items with the enumerated item sets  Table 2.  Transformed data  User ID URL 1 1 3 4 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 2 1 3 4  001\002 Phase 4 finds the frequent patterns in the transformed data by the counting algorithm similar to DHP. We can obtain the frequent sequential patterns that satisfy the minimum support. In this case, the sequences <1 2> <1 3> <2 3> <1 2 3> appear twice so they are all frequent sequences  We can employ a lexical tree to count the frequent sequential patterns efficiently during phase 4. Figure 8 shows the paths of the lexical tree. Figure 9 shows the quential pattern search algorithm along with the support percentage and the execution ansaction database  4. Conclusions  We have introduced the Internet Search Advisor ISA\, a personalized, knowledge-driven search system that helps the user to find web information based on individual preferences. To our knowledge, no existing search engines provide such personalized search results We have also implemented a data miner to extract association rules and sequential patterns based on an improved DHP algorithm that reduces the cost of the trim process. Finally we have introduced a data structure, called lexical tree, to find sequential patterns efficiently In the future, we need to develop an efficient sequential pattern data-mining algorithm that avoids generating all the candidate sets. We also need an efficient similarity-matching algorithm to find the similar URLs related to a specific keyword  References  1  R  A g arw a l   C  A g arw a l an d V  P r asad  A T r ee P r o j ect i o n  Algorithm for Generation of Frequent Item Sets Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing pp. 350-371, 2001  2 S  Ag a r wa l  R  Ag r a wa l   P  M   D e s h p a n d e   A Gu p t a   J  F   Naughton, R.Ramakrishnan, and S.

Such a small mod ification to the original HPA algorithm could improve the linearity substantially 4.6 Effect of increasing transaction Figure 13 shows the effect of increasing transac tion database sue as the number of transactions is increased from 256,000 to 2 million transactions We used the data set t15.14 The behavior of the results does not change with increased database size The minimum support value was set to 0.4 The num ber of processors is kept at 16 As shown each of the parallel algorithms attains linearity 5 Summary and related work In this paper we proposed four parallel algorithms for mining association rules A summary of the four database size Sizeup 0 I 0 500 loo0 1500 uxw amount of transaction thousands Figure 13 Sizeup curve algorithms is shown in Table 5 In NPA the candi date itemsets are just copied amongst all the proces sors Each processor works on the entire candidate itemsets NPA requires no data transfer when the supports are counted However in the case where the entire candidate itemsets do not fit within the mem ory of a single processor the candidate itemsets are divided and the supports are counted by scanning the transaction database repeatedly Thus Disk 1/0 cost of NPA is high PDM, proposed in 6 is the same as NPA which copies the candidate itemsets among all the processors Disk 1/0 for PDM should be also high The remaining three algorithms SPA HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets over the memory space of all the processors Because it better exploits the total system's memory, disk 1/0 cost is low SPA arbitrarily partitions the candidate itemsets equally among the processors Since each processor broadcasts its local transaction data to all other pro cessors the communication cost is high HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets using a hash function which eliminates the need for transac tion data broadcasting and can reduce the comparison workload significantly HPA-ELD detects frequently occurring itemsets and handles them separately which can reduce the influence of the workload skew 6 Conclusions Since mining association rules requires several scans of the transaction file its computational requirements are too large for a single processor to have a reasonable response time This motivates our research In this paper we proposed four different parallel algorithms for mining association rules on a shared nothing parallel machine and examined their viabil 29 


Table 5 characteristics of algorithms ity through implementation on a 64 node parallel ma chine the Fujitsu AP1000DDV If a single processor can hold all the candidate item sets parallelization is straightforward It is just suf ficient to partition the transaction over the proces sors and for each processor to process the allocated transaction data in parallel We named this algo rithm NPA However when we try to do large scale data mining against a very large transaction file the candidate itemsets become too large to fit within the main memory of a single processor In addition to the size of a transaction file a small minimum support also increases the size of the candidate itemsets As we decrease the minimum support computation time grows rapidly but in many cases we can discover more interesting association rules SPA HPA and HPA-ELD not only partition the transaction file but partition the candidate itemsets among all the processors We implemented these al gorithms on a shard-nothing parallel machine Per formance evaluations show that the best algorithm HPA-ELD attains good linearity on speedup by fully utilizing all the available memory space which is also effective for skew handling At present we are doing the parallelization of mining generalized association rules described in 9 which includes the taxonomy is-a hierarchy Each item belongs to its own class hierarchy In such mining associations between the higher class and the lower class are also examined Thus the candidate itemset space becomes much larger and its computation time also takes even longer than the naive single level association mining Parallel pro cessing is essential for such heavy mining processing Acknowledgments This research is partially supported as a priority research program by ministry of education We would like to thank the F\221ujitsu Parallel Computing Research Center for allowing us to use their APlOOODDV sys tems References l R.Agrawal T.Imielinski and ASwami 223Min ing Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Manage ment of Data pp207-216 May 1993 2 R.Agrawal and RSrikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.487-499 September 1994 3 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223An Effec tive Hash-Based Algorithm for Mining Associ ation Rules\224 In Proc of the 1995 ACM SIG MOD International Conference on the Manage ment of Data SIGMOD Record Vo1.24 pp.175 186 June 1995 4 H.Mannila H.Toivonen and A.I.Verkamo 223Ef ficient Algorithms for Discovering Association Rules\224 In KDD-94:AAAI Workshop on Knowl edge Discovery in Databases pp.181-192 July 1994 5 A.Savasere, E.Omiecinski and S.Navathe 223An Effective Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 21th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.432-444 September 1995 6 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223Efficient Parallel Data Mining for Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 4th International Conference on In formation and Knowledge Management pp.31 36 November 1995 7 T.Shintani and M.Kitsuregawa 223Considera tion on Parallelization of Database Mining\224 In Institute of Electronics Information and Com munication Engineering Japan SIG CPS Y95 88 Technical Report Vo1.95 No.47 pp.57-62 December 1995 8 T.Shimizu T.Horie and H.Ishihata 223Perfor mance Evaluation of the APlOOO Effects of message handling broadcast and barrier syn chronization on benchmark performance-\224  In S WO PP 22292 9.2 ARC 95 Information Processing Society of Japan Vo1.92 No.64 1992 9 R.Srikant and R.Agrawal 223Mining Generalized Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 21th Inter national Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.407-419 September 1995 30
