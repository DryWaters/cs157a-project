Online Web Mining Transactions Association Rules using Frame Metadata Model\222 Joseph Fong J.G Hughes Jianhan Zhu Department of Computer Science Northern Ireland Knowledge Engineering City University of Hong Kong Hong Laboratory Kong University of Ulster Belfast Northern Ireland Email csifong@cityu.edu.hk Email jghughes jh.zhu ulst.ac.uk Abstract In this paper we introduce a frame metadata model to facilitate the continuous association rules of web transactions 
A new set of association rules can be derived with the update of the web log file by the web transactions in the frame metadata model The frame metadata model consists of two types of classes static classes and active classes The static classes describe the web transactions of the association rule table The active classes are event driven obtaining web transactions when invoked by a 
certain event Whenever an update occurs in the existing web transactions in the web log file a corresponding update will be invoked by an event attribute in the method class which will compute the association rules continuously The result is an active web mining capable of deriving association rules of a web transactions continuously or incrementally using frame metadata model 1 Introduction The process of keeping the support 
and confidence up to-date in response to the changes in the web transaction data is to generate new set of association rules on-line 13 Deriving association rules can be achieved by full re computation of the support and confidence level of association rule continuously or incrementally by computing new record counts in the source database created since last computing date In web mining we analyze users\222 activities on a website using web log file To extract transaction activities for association rules 
we can combine Web Server Log File with Record from users\222 use of Cookies, and map all the information into a main table for further processing of web transactions extraction The main table can be stored in common commercial database We then select interested records into transaction table, such as transactions made by users We have a range of URL addresses related to transactions as shown in Figure 1 
The frame metadata model consists of four classes: the header class identifies each fact table the attribute class defines its attributes\222 properties the method class stores its data operations and condition and the constraint class describes each event occurrence They can be used to implement an event driven active web mining When an event occurs it triggers a process in the constraint class which calls for the operations in the method class for action Web transactions can be actively updated to generate the 
association rules for decision support systems The result is an active web mining For example an association rule below indicates that the transactions of AI A2  An will most likely associate with the web transactions of B Al A2  An  B The Support and Confidence level of this association is  100 Record Count\(Al n A2n  n

In the authors presented structures of web mining process from preparing web log data to the implementation of traditional data mining algorithms on them The approaches adopted by data miners on web mining include association rules sequential patterns clustering classification etc. Besides association rules in 5 the authors discussed discovery of users\222 navigation patterns from web log file using sequence Web mining relied mainly on log file information to develop an association[6 7 presented a Association Rule Hypergraph Partitioning and Principal Component Partitioning to automatically discover document associations 3 Frame metadata model A frame metadata model  161 consists of header attributes methods and constraints as follows Header Class  Class-name Parents  a list of superclass names Operation  program call for operations  an unique name in all system Class-type  active or static class Attributes-name  an attribute in this class Class-name  reference to header class Method-name  a method in this class Attributes-type  attribute data type Association attribute  pointer to another class Default-value  predefined value Cardinality  single or multi-valued Description  description of the attributes Method-name a method component in this class Class-name  reference to header class Parameters  Number of arguments for the method Method-type  return type of method Condition  the rule conditions Action  the rule actions Attribute Class  Method Class  Constraint Class  Constraint-name a constraint component of this class Class-name  reference the header class Method-name  constrict method name Parameters //Number of argument for the method Ownership  the class name of method owner Event  triggered event: create update or delete Sequence  method action time before or after Timing the method action timer 4 Continuous Web mining association rules In web mining users activities on website are recorded into log file online We can identify each user identity through cookies name of the directory set up dynamically for this user\222s transaction record IP address, or credit card number etc The Web Transaction Table is continuously updated even though a set of association rules have been derived from the Web Transaction Table before In order to maintain the current status of the association rules we need to update the statistical analysis of association rules continuously whenever the Web Transaction Table being updated This can be accomplished in Figure 3 123

produce rules like the following if there are two rectangles and one square then we are likely to 256nd three triangles The issues are the combinatorial growth of all the possibilities to mine and also a more complex type of condition We will also study more deeply the problem of mining images with more complex shapes such as the irregular one similar to the letter L We need a systematic approach to determine an optimal similarity threshold or at least a close one A very high threshold means only perfect matches are accepted On the other hand a very low similarity threshold may mean any object is similar to any other object Finding the right similarity threshold for each image type l ooks like an interesting problem Right now it is provided by the user but it can be changed to be tuned by the algorithm itself Also there are many ways to tune the eleven parameters to match blobs and the optimal tuning may be speci\256c to image type There also exists the possibility of using other segmentation algorithms that could perform faster or better feature extraction It is important to note that these algorithms should give a means to compare segmented regions and provide suitable parameters to perform object matching in order to be useful for image mining From our experimental results it is clear that this step is a bottleneck for the overall performance of image mining We can change the object identi\256cation algorithms to generate overlapping object associations using more features Our algorithm currently generates partititons of objects that is if one object is considered similar To another one the latter one will not be compared again By generating overlapping associations we can 256nd even more rules For instance a red rectangular object may be considered similar to another rectangular object and at the same time be similar to another red object Mining by position is also possible for instance two objects in a certain position may imply another object to be in some other position Since the software we are using for feature extraction produces eleven parameters to describe blobs we have 2 11 possibilites to match objects 7 Conclusions We presented a new algorithm to perform data mining on images and an initial experimental and performance study The positive points about our algorithm to 256nd association rules in images and its implementation include the following It does not use domain knowledge it is reasonably fast it does not produce meaningless or false rules it is automated for the most part The negative points include some valid rules are discarded because of low s upport there are repeated rules because of different object id's unwanted matches because of blobs representing several objects slow feature extraction step a careful tuning of several parameters is needed it does not work well with complex images We studied this problem in the context of data mining for databases Our image mining algorithm has 4 major steps feature extraction object identi\256cation auxiliary image creation and identi\256ed object mining The slowest part of image mining is the feature extraction step which is really a part of the process of storing images in a CBIR system and is done only once The next slowest operation is creating the auxiliary blob images which is also done once Object identi\256cation and association rule 256nding are fairly fast and scale up well with image set size We also presented several improvements to our initial approach of image mining Our experimental results are promising and show some potential for future study Rules referring to speci\256c objects are obtained regardless of object position object orientation and even object shape when one object is partially hidden Image mining is feasible to obtain simple rules from not complex images with a few simple objects Nevertheless it requires human intervention and some domain knowledge to obtain better results Images contain a great deal of information and thus the amount of knowledge that we can extract from them is enormous This work is an attempt to combine association rules with automatically identi\256ed objects obtained from a matching process on segmented images Although our experimental results are far from perfect we show that it is better to discover some reliable knowledge automatically than not discovering any new knowledge at all Acknowledgments We thank Chad Carson from the University of California at Berkeley for helping us setup the Blobworld system We also thank Sham Navathe and Norberto Ezquerra for
