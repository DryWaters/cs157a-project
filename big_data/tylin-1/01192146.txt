mining and three data mining techniques that we have applied to spatio-temporal data We include a detailed review of various sources of geospatial oceanographic and meteorological data and associated issues inherent in their use in knowledge discovery We also provide issues relevant to the difficulties in providing an overall integration of this heterogeneous data for knowledge discovery lntroduction Data mining or knowledge discovery generally refers to a variety of techniques that have developed in the fields of databases machine learning and pattern recognition The intent is to uncover useful patterns and associations from large databases. There are 
specific characteristics of spatial and temporal data such as found in GIS and multi-media data that make knowledge discovery in this domain more complex than in mining ordinary data such as found in typical business sales applications In this paper we review briefly some background of data mining and specifically spatial data mining Then we focus an some the issues that have arisen in OUT data mining research relative to spatial data characteristics that cause difficulties in data mining Data Mining Overview The initial steps of data mining are concerned with preparation of data including data cleaning intended to resolve errors and missing data and integration of 
data from multiple heterogeneous sources Next are the steps needed to prepare for actual data mining including the selection of the specific data relevant to the task and the transformation of this data into a format required by the data mining approach Finally specific data mining algorithms such as class description association rules and classification clustering are applied The initial steps of the process are concemed with preparation of data including data cleaning intended to resolve errors and missing data and integration of data from multiple heterogeneous sources Next are the steps needed to prepare for actual data mining These include the selection of the specific data relevant to the 
task and the transformation of this data into a format required by the data mining approach These steps are sometimes considered to be those in the development of a data warehouse i.e an organized format of data available for various data mining tools  11 There are a wide variety of specific knowledge discovery algorithms that have been developed 2 These discover patterns that can then be evaluated based on some interestingness measure used to prune the huge number of available patterns Specific data mining algorithms can be considered as belonging to two categories  descriptive and predictive data mining In the descriptive category are class description association rules and classification 
Class description can either provide a characterization or generalization of the data or comparisons between data classes to provide class discriminations Association rules correspond to correlations among the data items and they are often expressed in rule form showing attribute-value conditions that commonly occur at the same time in\222 some set of data An association rule of the form X  Y can be interpreted as meaning that the tuples in the database that satisfy the condition X also are 223likely\224 to satisfy Y so that the 223likely\224 implies this is not a functional dependency in the formal database 
sense Finally a classification approach analyzes the training data data whose class membership is known and constructs a model for each class based on the features in the data Commonly the outputs generated are decision trees or sets of classification rules These can be used both for the characterization of the classes of existing data and to allow the classification of data in the future and so can also be considered predictive Predictive analysis is also a very developed area of data mining One very common approach is clustering Clustering analysis identifies the collections of data objects that are similar to each other The 
similarity metric is often a distance function given by experts or appropriate users A good clustering method produces high quality clusters to yield low inter-cluster similarity and high intra-cluster similarity Prediction techniques are used to predict possible missing data values or distributions of values of some attributes in a set of objects First one must find the set of attributes relevant to the attribute of interest and then predict a distribution of values based on the set of data similar to the selected objects There are a large variety of techniques used including regression analysis correlation 0-7803-7 534-3/$10.0002002 IEEE 1264 


analysis, genetic algorithms and neural networks to mention a few Finally a particular case of predictive analysis is time series analysis This technique considers a large set of time-based data to discover regularities and interesting characteristics One can search for similar sequences or subsequences then mine sequential pattems periodicities trends and deviations There is now considerable interest in spatial data mining but only recently have major research efforts been developed in this area A major difference between data mining in ordinary relational databases and in spatial databases is that attributes of the neighbors of some object of interest may have an influence on the object and therefore have to be considered as well The explicit location and extension of spatial objects define implicit relations of spatial neighborhood such as topological distance and direction relations which are used by spatial data mining algorithms GlDB Data Mining We are developing approaches for spatial data mining under the objective of developing ways of processing large amounts of spatia-temporal data especially of oceanographic and littoral regions and including meteorological information Our goal is to integrate data mining techniques into the Geospatial lnformation Database GIDB system described below The ultimate aim is to provide knowledge-enhanced information to decision tools that will be used by US Navy and Marine planners The GIDB includes an object-oriented data model an object-oriented database management system OODBMS and various analysis tools While the model provides the design of classes and hierarchies the OODBMS provides an effective means of control and management of objects on disk such as locking transaction control etc The OODBMS in use is Ozone an open-source database management system This has been beneficial in several aspects Among these access to the source code allows customization and there are no costly commercial database licensing fees on deployment Spatial and temporal analysis tools include query interaction, multimedia support and map symbology support Users can query the database by area-of-interest, time-of-interest distance and attribute For example statistics and data plots can be generated to reflect wave height for a given span of time at an ocean sensor Interfaces are implemented to afford compatibility with Archfo Oracle Si Matlab, and others The object-oriented approach has been beneficial in dealing with complex spatial data and it has also permitted integration of a variety of raster and vector data products in a common database Some of the raster data include satellite and motion imagery Compressed ARC Digitized Raster Graphics CADRG\Controlled Image Base CIB jpeg and video Vector data includes Vector Product Format VPF products from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency NIMA Shape real-time and in-situ sensor data and Digital Terrain Elevation Data DTED The VPF data includes such NIMA products as Digital Nautical Chart DNC Vector Map VMAP Urban Vector Map UVMAP Digital Topographic Data Mission Specific Data Sets DTOP MSDS and Tactical Oceanographic Data TOD The system includes a communications portal that enables users to obtain data from a variety of data providers distributed over the lntemet in addition to the GIDB These providers include Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center FNMOC USGS Digital EartmASA and the Geography NetworWESRI A significant FNMOC product is the Coupled OceadAtmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System COAMPS data The atmospheric components of COAMPS are used operationally by the US Navy for short-term numerical weather prediction for various regions around the world Our communications gateway provides a convenient means for users to obtain COAMPS data and incorporate it with other vector and raster data in map form The gateway establishes a well-defined interface that brings together such heterogeneous data for a common geo referenced presentation to the user An illustration of the interface for a typical data request is shown in Figure 1 Fig 1. GIDB Interface We have applied several data mining techniques to spatial data of interest to the Navy These include association rules attribute generalization and predictive modeling The predictive modeling is a support vector regression approach using a COTS system We built a predictive model of wave heights and frequency using data from the twenty years of data observations of sea conditions at the Field Research Facility in Duck North Carolina USA The objective was to provide advisory information to tactical Naval planners for amphibious operations The attribute-oriented induction approach produces a generalized representation by either attribute removal or attribute generalization We applied this technique to sea bottom data from IO locations such as areas in the Philippines Mediterranean Persian Gulf etc Here the 1265 


intended application was to characterize various sea bottom areas for the planning of a mine deployment I hunting mission The spatial data was queried to formulate the files from which the attribute generalization was done The basic query was on bottom sediment classification as this was the major characteristic of interest to experts Finally an extension of association rule discovely applied to fuzzy spatial data is being developed 3 Since the data we are interested in as is typical of much spatial data 4 has uncertainty associated we can model this using fuzzy sets SI As an example consider using a spatial database to provide assistance in the logistical planning for a military operation. Then we might wish to uncover some of the important relationships of the data attributes in each area to provide guidance in the mission planning An example of a possible rule that might he discovered is of the form If C is a small c and has good terrain nearby then there is a  nearby with 90 confidence Such a rule incorporates fuzzy information in the linguistic terms used such as \223small\224 and 223nearby.\224 DATA This section surveys different sources and types of geospatial oceanographic and meteorological data and associated issues inherent in their use in knowledge discovery Some data sources include the National Imagery and Mapping Agency NIMA Naval Oceanographic Office NAVO and FRF Our overview of these spatio temporal data sources 221may be of use to research in data mining as some of these are sources not commonly known outside the DOD community Such a diverse mix of data will be seen to present a number of troublesome issues for knowledge discovery A Vecror Doto  NIMA The National Imagery and Mapping Agency NlMA is a major source of environmental data for the Department of Defense and the private sector In the 1980\222s NlMA began the process of transforming their paper mapping data to digital format with a new database specification Vector Product Format \(VPF Generally VPF separates data into thematic coverages with each of these coverages containing thematically consistent data 6 A detailed listing of NIMAs digital data is available in 7 Each product is designed to fill different needs Digital Nautical Chart DNC for example is directed at marine navigation and GIS applications and it contains significant features collected from harbor approach coastal and general charts Digital Topographic Data DTOP is produced for specific geographic areas DTOP consists of thematic layers from terrain analysis and topographic line maps Themes include vegetation transportation surface materials, surface drainage, obstacles surface configuration or slope

vegetation surface material surface slope surface drainage obstacles and transportation Features correspond to a 1 SO,OOO scale map 7,81 Vector Map \(VMAP is provided in Levels 0 I and 2 each increasing from small to large scale Data coverages include boundaries elevation hydrography industry physiography population transportation utilities and vegetation Urban Vector Map WMAP provides specific vector-based geospatial data with city graphic content The same coverages are provided as for VMAP Detail is similar to NIMA city graphic and military city map products World Vector Shoreline WVS content includes shoreline international boundaries maritime boundaries and country labels Five libraries provide data derive from 1 250,000 to 1 12,000,000 scale source Digital Feature Analysis

format with one record for each feature Each record contains coded attributes and a coordinate string DFAD is collected from photogrammetric as well as cartographic source material DFAD Level 1 offers medium scale detail 1:250,000 and Level 2 offers higher scale I:SO,OOO The types of features included in DFAD include roads, railways drainage prominent buildings in urban areas and prominent towers and power lines E Miscellaneous Data Repositories Data repositories and clearing houses hold spatial environmental data in a centralized location or make the availability of data at different locations known to prospective users One such repository is the Terrain Resource Repository TRR NIMA\222s Terrain Modeling Project Office TMPO maintains the TRR The TRR provides Internet access to various terrain data products available From the Department of Defense 9 Users can access samples of many of NIMAs standard data products along with software for viewing The TRR also provides links to numerous web sites that are sources for environmental data Among these are data sources 


maintained by state agencies, the US Geologic Survey the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration the US Census Bureau the US Department of Transportation the US Department of Agriculture the Bureau of Land Management the Canadian Government and the United Nations The Master Environmental Library MEL is another repository The Defense Modeling Simulation Office DMSO maintains MEL MEL indexes environmental data source location Through MEL, users can locate and order environmental data online IO The Tactical Oceanography Wide Area Network TOWAN is also a potential data repository The Naval Research Laboratory provides TOWAN as an online environmental data repository and server that allows Department of Defense personnel and their contractors to search for and retrieve environmental information TOWAN makes oceanographic databases available including bathymetric geoacoustics ice and magnetics TOWAN is one of the nodes in MEL I I The National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse NGDC aggregates numerous spatial data servers and provides a search interface Search options include location time period of content full text and fielded search using country names or US placenames A custom search allows users to define parameters including map temporal and server 121 The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Server NOAA provides an on-line search by area-of-interest access to several databases These databases include the NOAA Central Library the Japan Science and Technology Corporation the Foreign Data Library the Office of Oceanographic and Atmospheric Research the National Weather Service and the National Snow and Ice Data Center 1131 While centralized data repositories and clearinghouses make the existence of data known to prospective users, they do not necessarily provide a means to actually use the data once it is obtained There are numerous data models in which spatial data are organized and many proprietary database formats Whether the data is acquired from a resource provider such as NJMA a repository or another producer it entails learning another data model and data format and also means writing code to import into the user\222s native format C Oceanographic Dara The Naval oceanographic Office \(NAVO\produces and processes oceanograpbic data for the US Navy Among the data produced by NAVO relevant to our study is bottom sediment data produced for mine warfare operations This covers various locations worldwide and consists of polygons attributed with bottom sediment type i.e sand coral, clay, gravel, silty sand, etc Model Output Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center FNMOC runs atmospheric predictive models 14 Representative of the nature of the output is the Coupled OceadAtmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System COAMPS data The atmospheric components of COAMPS are used operationally by the U.S Navy for short-term numerical weather prediction for various regions around the world COAMPS output includes data about expected precipitation evaporation winds humidity temperature dew point depression etc Each parameter is given for various atmospheric levels usually at 3-hour increments for a 72-hour period This is griddcd data over specific areas of the earth with some products providing worldwide coverage The Air Force Weather Agency and the US Weather Service produce similar model output D Observorional Dara Argus Sires There are twelve Argus Study Sites located at various locations around the world that record and archive observations of sea and atmospheric conditions  151 Sensors record changing waves winds tides and currents on approximately an hourly basis lmagely makes possible the ascertainment of sand bar locations The sensor data together with the imagery opens the door to analysis of factors influencing beach morphology One such site is maintained at the army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility FRF\at Duck, NC This is detailed data that can he a valued source for knowledge discovery DATA ISSUES Data preparation is a crucial step to effective data mining Data preparation in the spatial-temporal data context involves not only classic data 221cleaning\222 but also issues peculiar to the nature of spatial and temporal data The latter include resolution of coordinate systems datum and scale for spatial data and resolution of temporal synchronicity and granularity for temporal data This section presents an overview of these matters followed by issues encountered in data preparation in relation to specific data A Spalio-Temporal Data issues By its very nature spatial data exists in a coordinate reference system that locates the data somewhere on the earth Generally, the mathematical model of the earth used to calculate coordinates is called a datum Spatial data preparation includes ensuring that all data are on the same datum This is important because coordinates for a point on the earth\222s surface calculated on one datum will not match the coordinates for the same point calculated on another datum Many local datum have been developed over the years to satisfy mapping requirements for specific regions Examples of these are the North American Datum of 1927 NAD27 the European Datum and the more obscure Afgooye Datum applicable to Somalia The World Geodetic System 1984 WGS84 has been developed to provide a unified world system for expressing geodetic data WGS84 is the datum currently in use by the US Department of Defense and NIMA products are based on 1267 


the WGS84 Public transformation parameters exist for conversion of coordinates from localized datum to WGS84 lust as it is important to ensure that all data is on the same horizontal datum it is equally important to veiify that all vertical measurements are on the same vertical datum when vertical measurements are important to the knowledge discovery task Use of mean sea level \(MSL\is common but many others can also be found such as low water mean lower low water neap tide or even as height above the ellipsoid to name just a few Most NlMA products express elevation in terms of MSL Global positioning systems give height above the ellipsoid In addition to datum issues working with spatial data in knowledge discovery requires an understanding of the data\222s coordinate reference system Rules for measuring distance for example in one coordinate system may not hold true for another Even more basic is the consideration that all data should be on the same coordinate system in order to simplify spatial analysis The location of spatial data is often expressed with geodetic coordinates of latitude and longitude These are based on an ellipsoid model of the earth Latitude is the angle between the plane of the equator and a line perpendicular to the ellipsoid at a given point Longitude is measured with respect to a prime meridian positive to the east and negative to the west Knowledge discovery in spatial data often involves spatial nearness or distance relationships Geodetic coordinates however are non-Cartesian and require a more coniplicated mathematical calculation great circle path to measure distance 17 Fig 2 shows a screenshot from the GlDB application The map shows NIMA DNC with NAVO bottom sediment data for the Onslow Bay area near the coast of North Carolina The data is shown overlaid on a CADRG a raster map produced by NIMA Any datum and coordinate system incompatibilities are resolved at the time the data are imported into the GIDB database Ll61 Fig 2 GlDB Screenshot Showing NEMA DNC with NAVO Bottom Sediments In addition to geodetic coordinates the location of spatial data may also be expressed in projected coordinates Map projections are common in map making They minimize some distortion while introducing others Some common projections include the Mercator the Transverse Mercator \(TM\Universal Transverse Mercator \(UTM and the Lambert Conformal Conic LCC The Mercator is often used in navigation the TM in quadrangle maps the UTM in large-scale military maps and the LCC in maps with predominantly east-west expanse  171 Some projections may make analysis of spatial relationships easier while other may introduce spatial distortions Those that preserve area may help with analysis of spatial extent while those that preserve scale and direction may help with analysis of nearness Data preparation may involve conversion of all coordinates to a single projection or conversion to geodetic,.according to the needs of the user Fig 3 shows the same area as figure 2 with the additional overlay of gridded and contoured weather data from FNMOC The wind barbs show model output wind data and the contour lines illustrate predicted temperatures The GlDB application allows the user to query these vector features in order to determine wind and temperature attribute values The same holds true for any vector surface Fig 3 GIDB Screenshot Showing the Additional Overlay of Weather Data from FNMOC Much digital spatial data, especially that from NIMA is derived from digitized paper maps Addressing map-scale and especially map-scale differences among such data is also an important step of the data preparation phase of mining spatial data Large-scale such as 1 20,000 spatial data will likely yield more feature-rich detail Small-scale such as 1:2,000,000 data may not Among the questions that need to be answered are whether the data has sufficient detail to yield results Small-scale data may also contain abstract representations of significant features or omit them entirely IS A map of a winding river at one scale may be represented as a nearly straight line at another and completely omitted at yet another Whether the corresponding digital spatial data is an accurate representation of reality or an abstraction may strongly affect the results of the knowledge discovely process Combining data from multiple scales can also impact spatial reasoning operations 1268 


Temporal data present similar issues involving temporal synchronicity and granularity Consider for example temporal atmospheric data consisting of measurements of winds atmospheric pressure rainfall etc each measured by different sensors that record events at various time intervals Some measure each hour some every six minutes some once per day, some once every month etc Depending on the needs of the user data preparation may require some combination of interpolation and binning in order to relate all atmospheric events to precise time intervals B Data Source Issues 1 NIMA data Most vector data distributed by NIMA is in Vector Product Format VPF A VPF database is made up of libraries that aggregate data by scale Libraries are organized into coverages of thematically consistent data that share a single coordinate system and scale and that are contained within a specified spatial extent Coverages can be tiled or geographically subdivided for the purpose of improving data management A tiling scheme defines tile boundaries the size of tiles and the handling of the features that lie on tile boundaries and text primitives that cross boundaries Tiling schemes are defined by product specifications rather than by VPF Coverages are composed of features Five categories of cartographic features are defined in VPF Point Line Area Complex and Text The coordinate system is defined at the library level 6j This data organization generally follows historic mapping techniques of organizing data in disjoint thematic layers While this method is favored for the production of maps in which layers are overlaid to produce the desired map view of the world its usefulness for other purposes can be problematic In particular one study I91 found that this practice resulted in considerable preprocessing and data integration to resolve inconsistencies between layers such as positional errors and to resolve missing attribute and geometric data for purposes of 3D synthetic environment construction For example in some cases in the Digital Nautical Chart feature attributes may be limited to the Digital Geographic Information Exchange Standard\222s DIGEST general feature and attribute coding catalogue FACC codes While this provides an adequate description of what a feature is on a map it fails to give detailed values with respect to this particular feature In some cases attribute values are designated as 221unknown.\222 NIMA\222s Mission Specific Data Sets \(MSDS on the other hand can be a good source of detailed data for a given area with populated attributes Since these are prepared in relation to specific missions they may not exist for a geographic area of interest Of note is the practice of some VPF products to aggregate varying scales within a database\222s library resulting in a scale-range rather than uniform scale within the library For knowledge discovery this means adapting the appropriate knowledge discovery technique to the data  1269 CONCLUSION 2\output This section covers issues relevant to use of gridded model output of the nature of that produced by FNMOC as discussed above This data covers a spatial extent but is highly dependent on the temporal element in that it consists of atmospheric forecasts at short-term periodic intervals originating from the time of the model run Format is CRIB a WMO World Meteorological Organization standard format for archiving and exchanging gridded data It is a binary format that offers some data compression Suitable software is necessary to read the file Because of the data volume of model output little historic output is warehoused necessitating a user-created data store for examining long-term trends or for examining predicted conditions at some time in the past Further, coordinates for the gridded data values are projected in the Mercator projection Care must be taken when merging this data with other spatial data to assure a common coordinate system 3 Observation data This section discusses issues concerning observation data in the context of the data collected at the Argus Site at the FRF mentioned above The discussion should be pertinent to a wide range of sensor-based observation data and serves to highlight areas in which special sensitivities are required in the data prep stage of knowledge discovely As discussed above this data consists of detailed sensor readings over long periods of time Its format is plain text and data for the Argus Site at the FRF is available on the Internet Sensors are periodically replaced and others temporarily malfunction or are turned off for maintenance This effectively produces 223holes\224 in which observations are missing in recorded series In addition sensors record at widely differing intervals ranging from minutes to days or more Of particular note is that the data provided to the public does not always differentiate between actual readings and a time-series summary Hourly reports of wave heights for example may be a summary of the existing conditions over a one-hour time period Further the reported wave height may not have been 223observed\224 but derived from pressure measurements Spatial considerations of datum and projection are relevant here The spatial locations of sensors and physical measurements of sand bar locations etc at the FRF site, for example are reported in a local coordinate system That local system uses cross-shore and along-shore axes to designate x,y coordinates Conversion to latitude and longitude or some other common projection is necessary in order to relate this data to other spatial data We have discussed a variety of data mining or knowledge discovery techniques all having the intent of uncovering useful patterns and associations from large databases We have been working with data mining techniques for a variety of oceanographic data and have 


encountered a number of troublesome issues relative to available data We have described the steps preparatory to data mining and three data mining techniques that we have applied to spatia-temporal data We included a detailed review of various sources of geospatial, oceanographic and meteorological data and associated issues inherent in their use in knowledge discovery We also provided issues relevant to the difficulties in providing an overall integration of this heterogeneous data for knowledge discovery  Generation TEC-0091 US Army Corps of Engineers  161 NIMA 2000 National Imagery and Mapping Agency Technical Report 8350.2, January 3,2000 I71 Snyder J Map Projections A Working Manual U.S Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395 U.S G0VW"nt Printing Office, Washington D.C 1987 I81 USGS Map Scales, Fact Sheet, 015-02 US I91 Trott K Anobis of Digital Topographic Data hues in support of Synthetic Environment Terrain Dofa Base Topographic Engineering Center, November 1996 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank the Naval Research Laboratory's Base Program Program Element No 0602435N for sponsoring this research REFERENCES I Han J and Kamber M Dafa Mining Concepts a,sd Techniques San Diego, CA Academic Press 2000 2 Hand D Mannila H and Smyth P Principles of Data Mining Cambridge, MA MIT Press 2001 3 Ladner R Petry F CobbM Fuzzy Set Approaches to Spatial Data Mining of Association Rules.To appear in Transactions in Geographic Information Systems 2003 4 Burrough P and Frank A eds Geographic Objects with Indeterminate Boundaries GISDATA Series Vol 2 London, UK  Taylor and Francis 1996 Uncertainty in Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Data Fuzzy Sets andSystems 113 1,2000 6 VPF, Departmentment of Defense Interface Standard for Vector Product Format MIL-STD 2407,28 June 7 NIMA Digitizing the Future National Imagery and 8 USAS US Army Simulation Training and 5 Cobb M Petry F and.

higher order interactions In addition we also applied the improved version of the k-means clustering algorithm in CLUTO When using cosine as the similarity measure we were able to identify 36 clean clusters out of 80 clusters which is worse than the hyperclique pattern approach Finally we observed the following effects of the hyperclique-based clustering approach If we set the minimum support threshold to 0 and h-con\223dence threshold to 20 the discovered hyperclique patterns cover 861 items Since there are 932 items in total the hyperclique pattern mining algorithm must have eliminated 71 items We amine the distribution of these 71 items in the CLUTO means clustering results We observe that 68 of the items are assigned to the wrong clusters by CLUTO As a result we believe that the items not covered by these hyperclique patterns are potentially noise items 6 Conclusions In this paper e formalized the problem of mining perclique patterns in data sets with skewed support distribution We also introduced the concept of cross-support property and showed how this property can be used to avoid generating spurious patterns involving items from different support levels Furthermore a ew algorithm called hyperclique miner was eveloped This algorithm utilizes crosssupport and anti-monotone properties of h-con\223dence for the ef\223cient discovery of hyperclique patterns Finally we demonstrated applications of hyperclique patterns for discovering strong af\223nity patterns among low-support items and for hyperclique-based item clustering For future work there is a potential for using the hyperclique concept in a variety of applications such as dimensionality reduction copy detection and collaborative 223ltering Also it is valuable to exploit the 000\001 002\003\003 003\004\005\005\002\001 006 property on some other interestingness measures Acknowledgments This work was partially supported by NASA grant  NCC 2 1231 NSF grant  ACI-9982274 DOE contract

of the query expression without ha ving the global view of the in ten tion There is a big c hance that the enco ded pro cedure ma y not b e the b est w a y to compute the rules dep ending on the database instance F urthermore as w e understand it their prop osals require p oten tially large n um ber of name generation for relations and attributes The names that are needed are usually database dep enden t and th us p ossibly cannot b e gathered at query time An additional pro cess needs to b e completed to gather those v ariables b efore actual computations can b egin 5  9 Optimization Issues While it w as in tellectually c hallenging to dev elop a declarativ e expression for asso ciation rule mining from deductiv e databases there are sev eral op en issues with great promises for resolution In the w orst case the least xp oin tneedsto generate n 2 tuples in the rst pass alone when the database size is n  Theoretically  this can happ en only when eac h transaction in the database pro duces an in tersection no de and when they are not related b y subset-sup erset relationship In the second pass w e need to do n 4 computations and so on The question no w is can w e a v oid generating and p erhaps scanning some of these com binations as they will not lead to useful in tersections F or example the no de b 0 3 in gure 11 is redundan t A signican t dierence with apriori lik e systems is that our system generates all the item sets top do wn in the lattice without taking their candidacy as a large item set in to consideration Apriori on the other hand do es not generate an y no de if their subsets are not large item sets themselv es and thereb y prunes a large set of no des Optimization tec hniques that exploit this so called an ti-monotonicit y prop ert y of item set lattices similar to apriori could mak e all the dierence in our setup The k ey issue w ould b e ho ww e push the selection threshold minim um supp ort inside the top do wn computation of the no des in the lattice in our metho d F or the momen t and for the sak e of this discussion let us consider a higher supp ort threshold of 60 for the database T of gure 9 No w the l-en v elop e will b e the one sho wn in ligh ter dashed lines in gure 11 and the no des under this line will b e the large item sets Notice that no ww eha v eto discard no des ad 2 0 and d 0 2 to o This raises the question is it p ossible to utilize the supp ort and condence thresholds pro vided in the query and prune candidates for in tersection an y further Ideas similar to magic sets transformation 3  24 ma y be b orro w ed to address this issue The only problem is that pruning of an y no de dep ends on its supp ort coun t whic h ma y come at a later stage By then all no des ma y already ha v e b een computed and th us pushing selection conditions inside aggregate op erator ma y b ecome non-trivial Sp ecial data structures and indexes ma y also aid in dev eloping faster metho ds to compute ecien t interse ction joins that w e ha v e utilized in this pap er W e lea v e these questions as op en issues that should be tak en up in the future F ortunately though there has been a v ast b o dy of researc h in optimizing Datalog programs including recursiv e programs suc h as the one w e ha v e used in this pap er and hence the new questions and researc h 5 Recall that their prop osal requires one to express the mining problem to the system using sev eral queries and up date statemen ts that utilizes information ab out the database con ten ts to ac hiev e its functionalit y  c hallenges that this prop osal raises for declarativ e mining ma y exploit some of these adv ances Needless to emphasize a declarativ e metho d preferably a formal one is desirable b ecause once w e understand the functioning of the system w e will then be able to select appropriate pro cedures dep ending on the instances to compute the seman tics of the program whic hw e kno wis in tended once w e establish the equiv alence of declarativ e and pro cedural seman tics of the system F ortunately  w e ha v e n umerous pro cedural metho ds for computing asso ciation rules whic h complemen t eac h other in terms of sp eed and database instances In fact that is what declarativ e systems or declarativit y buy us  a c hoice for the most ecien t and accurate pro cessing p ossible 10 Conclusion Our primary goal for this pap er has b een to demonstrate that mining asso ciation rules from an y rst-order kno wledge base is p ossible in a declarativ ew a y  without help from an y sp ecial to ols or mac hinery  and that w e can no wha v ea v ery in tuitiv e and simple program to do so W eha v esho wn that it is indeed p ossible to mine declarativ ekno wledge b y exploiting the existing mac hinery supp orted b ycon temp orary inference engines in programming languages e.g Prolog or kno wledge base systems e.g RelationLog XSB LD L  CORAL All w e require is that the engine b e able to supp ort set v alued terms grouping aggregate functions and set relational op erators for comparison functionalities whic hmostofthesesystemscurren tly supp ort W e ha v e also demonstrated that our formalism is grounded on a more mathematical foundation with formal prop erties on whic h the seman tics of the R ULES system rely  W e ha v e also raised sev eral op en issues related to eciency and query optimization whic h should b e our next order of business As future researc h w e plan to dev elop optimization tec hniques for mining queries that require non-trivial lo ok ahead and pruning tec hniques in aggregate functions The dev elopmen ts presen ted here also ha v e other signican t implications F or example it is no w p ossible to compute c hi square rules 4 using the building blo c ks pro vided b y our system Declarativ e computation of c hi square rules to our kno wledge has nev er b een attempted for the man y pro cedural concepts the computation of c hi square metho d relies on In a separate w ork 2 w e sho w that the coun ting metho d prop osed in this pap er can be eectiv ely utilized to generate the exp ectations needed in order to compute suc h rules rather easily  These are some of the issues w e plan to address in the near future The motiv ation imp ortance and the need for in tegrating data mining tec hnology with relational databases has b een addressed in sev eral articles suc h as 12  13 They con vincingly argue that without suc h in tegration data mining tec hnology ma y not nd itself in a viable p osition in the y ears to come T o b e a successful and feasible to ol for the analysis of business data in relational databases suc htec hnology m ust b e made a v ailable as part of database engines and as part of its declarativ e query language Our prop osal for declarativ e mining bears merit since it sheds ligh t on ho w rst order databases can be mined in a declarativ e and pro cedure indep enden t w a y so that the optimization issues can b e delegated to the underlying database engine Once suc h argumen ts are accepted sev eral systems 9 


related issues b ecome prime candidates for immediate atten tion F or example traditionally database systems supp orted declarativ e querying without the necessit y to care ab out the pro ceduralit y of the queries In this pap er w eha v e actually demonstrated that asso ciation rule mining can b e view ed as a Datalog query  It is immediate that a direct mapping from the Datalog expressions presen ted in this pap er to SQL can be dev elop ed with no problem at all W e can then rely on ecien t database pro cessing of the query in an optimized fashion Hence w ecomeclose to the essence of the visions expressed b y the leading database researc hers and practioners 12  References 1 Rak esh Agra w al and Ramakrishnan Srik an t F ast algorithms for mining asso ciation rules in large databases In VLDB  pages 487{499 1994 2 Anon ymous A declarativ e metho d for mining c hisquare rules from deductiv e databases T ec hnical rep ort Departmen t of Computer Science Anon ymous Univ ersit y USA F ebruary 2001 3 C Beeri and R Ramakrishnan On the po w er of magic In Pr o c e e dings of the 6th A CM Symp osium on Principles of Datab ase Systems  pages 269{283 1987 4 Sergey Brin Ra jeev Mot w ani and Craig Silv erstein Bey ond mark et bask ets Generalizing asso ciation rules to correlations In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 265 276 1997 5 D Chimen ti et al The LD L system protot yp e IEEE Journal on Data and Know le dge Engine ering  2\(1 90 1990 6 Jia w ei Han Jian P ei and Yiw en Yin Mining frequen t patterns without candidate generation In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 1{12 2000 7 Marcel Holsheimer Martin L Kersten Heikki Mannila and Hann uT oiv onen A p ersp ectiv e on databases and data mining In Pr o c of the sixth A CM SIGKDD Intl Conf  pages 150{155 Mon treal Queb ec 1995 8 Flip Korn Alexandros Labrinidis Y annis Kotidis and Christos F aloutsos Ratio rules A new paradigm for fast quan tiable data mining In Pr o c of 24th VLDB  pages 582{593 1998 9 Brian Len t Arun N Sw ami and Jennifer Widom Clustering asso ciation rules In Pr o c of the 3th ICDE  pages 220{231 1997 10 Mengc hi Liu Relationlog At yp ed extension to datalog with sets and tuples In John Llo yd editor Pr oc e e dings of the 12th International L o gic Pr o gr amming Symp osium  pages 83{97 P ortland Oregon Decem ber 1995 MIT Press 11 Rosa Meo Giusepp e Psaila and Stefano Ceri An extension to SQL for mining asso ciation rules Data Mining and Know le dge Disc overy  2\(2 1998 12 Amir Netz Sura jit Chaudh uri Je Bernhardt and Usama M F a yy ad In tegration of data mining with database tec hnology  In Pr o c e e dings of 26th VLDB  pages 719{722 2000 13 Amir Netz Sura jit Chaudh uri Usama M F a yy ad and Je Bernhardt In tegrating data mining with SQL databases In IEEE ICDE  2001 14 Ra ymond T Ng Laks V S Lakshmanan Jia w ei Han and Alex P ang Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained asso ciation rules In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 13{24 1998 15 Jong So o P ark Ming-Sy an Chen and Philip S Y u An eectiv e hash based algorithm for mining asso ciation rules In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 175{186 1995 16 Karthic k Ra jamani Alan Co x Bala Iy er and A tul Chadha Ecien t mining for asso ciation rules with relational database systems In Pr o c e e dings of the International Datab ase Engine ering and Applic ations Symp osium  pages 148{155 1999 17 R Ramakrishnan D Sriv asta v a and S Sudarshan CORAL  Con trol Relations and Logic In Pr o c of 18th VLDB Confer enc e  pages 238{250 1992 18 Konstan tinos F Sagonas T errance Swift and Da vid Scott W arren XSB as an ecien t deductiv e database engine In Pr o c of the A CM SIGMOD Intl Conf  pages 442{453 1994 19 Sunita Sara w agi Shib y Thomas and Rak esh Agra w al In tegrating mining with relational database systems Alternativ es and implications In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 343{354 1998 20 Ashok a Sa v asere Edw ard Omiecinski and Shamk an tB Nav athe An ecien t algorithm for mining asso ciation rules in large databases In Pr o c of 21th VLDB  pages 432{444 1995 21 Pradeep Sheno y  Ja y an t R Haritsa S Sudarshan Gaura v Bhalotia Ma y ank Ba w a and Dev a vrat Shah T urb o-c harging v ertical mining of large databases In A CM SIGMOD  pages 22{33 2000 22 Abraham Silb ersc hatz Henry F Korth and S Sudarshan Datab ase System Conc epts  McGra w-Hill third edition 1996 23 Shib y Thomas and Sunita Sara w agi Mining generalized asso ciation rules and sequen tial patterns using SQL queries In KDD  pages 344{348 1998 24 J D Ullman Principles of Datab ase and Know le dgeb ase Systems Part I II  Computer Science Press 1988 25 Mohammed J Zaki Generating non-redundan t association rules In Pr o c of the 6th A CM SIGKDD Intl Conf  Boston MA August 2000 1 0
