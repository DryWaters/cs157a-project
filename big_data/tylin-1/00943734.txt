of the taxonomy has been recognized as an important model in data mining. Earlier work on generalized association rules confined the minimum supports to be uniformly specified for all items or items within the same taxonomy level This constraint would restrain an expert to discover some more inter esting but much less supported association rules In our previous work we have addressed this problem and proposed two algorithms MMS-Cumulate and MMSStratify In this paper 
we examined the problem of maintaining the discovered multi-support, general ized association rules when new transactions are added into the original database We proposed an algorithm MMS-UP Empirical evaluation showed that MMS-UP is 2-6 times faster than running MMS-Cumulate or MMS-Stratify on the updated da tabase afresh Keywords Data mining, generalized association rules maintenance, multiple minimum supports, and taxon omy 1 Introduction Mining association rules from a large database of busi ness data such as 
transaction records, has been a hot topic within the area of data mining 1][2][10][13 This problem is originally motivated by applications known as market basket analysis to find relationships between items purchased by customers that is what kinds of products tend to be purchased together For example, an association rule Desktop Ink-jet \(Support=30 Confidence=60 says that 30 support of customers purchase both Desktop PC and Ink-jet 
printer together and 60 confidence of customers who purchase Desktop PC also purchase Ink-jet printer Such information is use ful in many aspects of market management such as store layout planning, target marketing, understanding customer\222s behavior, etc cbc@isu.edu.tw In many applications there are taxonomies hierar chies\explicitly or implicitly, over the items In some applications it may be more useful to find associations at different levels of the taxonomy than only at the primitive concept level 
6 141 For example, consider Figure 1 the taxonomy of items from which the previ ous association rule derived Printer Scanner  Non-impact Dot-matrix Desktop Notebook Laser Ink-jet I Figure 1 An example taxonomy T It is likely to happen that the association rule Desktop 3 Ink-jet \(Support=30 Confidence=60 does not hold when the minimum support is set as 40 but the following association 
rule may be valid PC a Printer Besides note that in reality the frequencies of items are not uniform. Some items occur very frequently in the transactions while others rarely appear. In this case a uniform minimum support assumption would hinder the discovery of some deviations or exceptions that are more interesting but much less supported than general trends To meet the mentioned situations we have investigated the problem of mining generalized association rules across different levels of the taxonomy 
with non uniform minimum supports We proposed two efficient algorithms, called MMS-Cumulate and MMSStratify 16 which not only can discover associations that span different hierarchy levels but also have high po tential to produce rare but informative item rules The proposed approaches however are not effective to the situation for frequently update to the large source database In this case, adopting the mining ap 0-7803-7078-3/0U$lO C IEEE Page 1294 


proach tends to re-applying the whole process on the updated database to reflect correctly the most recent associations between items This is not cost-effective and is unacceptable in general To be more realistic and costeffective it is better to perform the associa tion mining algorithms to generate the initial associa tion rules and then when update to the source database occurs apply an incremental maintenance method to re-build the discovered rules. The challenge falls into deploying an efficient maintenance algorithm to facili tate the whole mining process. This problem is nontriv ial because updates may invalidate some of the discov ered association rules turn previous weak rules into strong ones and import new undiscovered rules In this paper we addressed the issues for developing efficient maintenance methods and proposed an algo rithm called the MMS-UP Our algorithm can incre mentally update the generalized associated rules with non-uniform support specification and is capable of effectively reducing the number of candidate sets and database re-scanning. The performance study showed that MMS-Up is 2-6 times faster than running MMS-Cumulate or MMS-Stratify on the updated da tabase afresh The remaining of the paper is organized as follows A review of related work is given in Section 2 The prob lem of maintaining generalized association rules with multiple minimum supports is formalized in Section 3 In Section 4 we explain the proposed algorithms for updating large itemsets with multiple minimum sup ports The evaluation of the proposed algorithm on IE%M synthetic data is described in Section 5 Finally our conclusions are stated in Section 6 2 Related Work The problem of incremental updating association rules was first addressed by Cheung et a1 3 They coined the essence of updating the discovered association rules when new transaction records are added into the incremental database over time and proposed an algo rithm called FW Fast Update By making use of the discovered large itemsets the proposed algorithm can dramatically reduce the efforts for computing the large itemsets in the updated database In 4 they extended the model to incorporate the situations of deletion and modification and examined further the maintenance of multi-level association rules in 5 Since then substantial techniques have been proposed to improve the efficient aspect of incremental updating algorithin including the negative 'order in  12 151 the dynamic counting in 9 time window in I1 11 and two support thresholds in 7][11  etc 3 Problem Statement 3.1 Mining multi-support, generalized association rules Let I i i2  i be a set of items and DB  t t2  tn be a set of transactions, where each transaction ti  ti4 A has a unique identifier tid and a set of items A Ad We assume that the taxonomy of items T is available and is denoted as a directed acyclic graph on I U J where J  Ql,j2 jp represents the set of gen eralized items derived from I An edge in T denotes an is-a relationship that is if there is an edge ffomj to i we callj a parent \(generalization of i and i a child ofj For example in Figure 1 I  Laser printer Ink-jet printer Dot matrix printer Desktop PC Notebook Scanner} and J  Non-impact printer Printer, Per sonal computer Definition 1 Given a transaction t  tid A we say an itemset B is in t if every item in B is in A or is an ancestor of some item in A An itemset B has support s denoted as s  sup\(B in the transaction set DB ifs of transactions in DB contain B Definition 2 Given a set of transactions DB and a taxonomy T a generalized association rule is an implication of the form A a B where A B c Z U J A n B  0 and no item in B is an ancestor of any item in A The support of this rule sup\(A 2 B is equal to the support of A U B The confidence of the rule conAA 3 B is the ratio of sup\(A U B versus sq\(A The condition in Definition 2 that no item in A is an ancestor of any item in B is essential; otherwise, a rule of the form a ancestor always has 100 confi dence and is trivial Definition 3 Let m\(a denote the minimum support of an item a in I w J An itemset A  a aZ  ai where ai E Zu J is large if the support of A is larger than the lowest value of minimum support of items in A i.e sup\(A 2 min a EA ms\(a Definition 4 A multi-support, generalized association rule A  B is strong if the support satisfies the follow ing condition s~P\(A  B 2 min a EA~B ms\(4 and conAA 3 B 2 minconJ Definition 5 Given a set of transactions DB a taxon omy T the user-specified minimum supports for all items in T m\(a ms\(a2  m\(a and the min con the problem of mining multi-support generalized 0-7803-7@78-3/0V$10.00 C IEEE Page 12 


association rules is to find all association rules that are strong As founded in I the task of mining association rules is usually decomposed into two steps 1 Itemset generation find all large itemsets that have support exceeding a threshold minimum support Rule construction: from the set of large itemsets construct all association rules that have a confi dence exceeding a threshold minimum confidence 2 Since the solution to the second subproblem is straight forward, the problem can be reduced to finding the set of large itemsets that satisfy the specified minimum support 3.2 Maintaining multi-support generalized associa tion rules In real business applications, the database grows over time This implies that if the updated database is proc essed afresh the previous discovered associations might be invalid and some undiscovered associations should be generated. That is the discovered associa tion rules must be updated to reflect the new circum stance Analogous to the associations mining this problem can be reduced to updating the large itemsets Definition 6 Let DB denote the original database db the incremental database UD the updated database containing db and DB i.e UD  db  DB T the tax onomy of items and LDB the set of large itemsets in DB The problem of updating the large itemsets with tax onomy and multiple supports is to find LuD  AI supuD\(A 2 min EA ms\(uj given the knowledge of DB T db LDB and SU~,\(A Q A E LDB 4 Update of Large Itemsets for Multi-support Generalized Association Rules In this section, we will describe the proposed algorithm MMS-UP stands for Multiple Minimum Support as sociation rules Update For discussion purpose we first introduce the primary issues for mining multi support generalized association rules, and present our proposed algorithms MMS-Cumulate and MMSStratify for generating the large itemsets 4.1 Mining of multi-support generalized associa tion rules The proposed algorithms MMS-Cumulate and MMS-Stratify follow the level-wise approach to gen erate all large k-iternsets First scan the whole data base DB and count the occurrence of each item to gen erate the set of all frequent 1-itemsets  In each subsequent step k k 2 2 the set of large k-itemsets Lk is generated as follows 1 Generate a set of candidate k-itemsets ck+I from Lk-1 using the apriori-gen de scribed in 2 2 Scan the database DB count the oc curcence of each itemset in Cbl and prune those with less support The resulting set is Lk The above paradigm, however, has to be modified to incorporate taxonomy information and multiple mini mum supports. First, note that in the presence of tax onomy an item can be composed of items, primitive or generalized, in the taxonomy To calculate the occur rence of each itemset, the current scanned transaction t is extended to include the generalized items of all its composed items. Secondly, the apriori-gen procedure based on the concept of downward closure does not work for multiple support specification. For example consider four items U b c and d that have minimum supports specified as ms\(a  15 ms\(b  20 ms\(c  4 and m\(d  6 Clearly a 2-itemset a b with 10 of support is discarded for 10 min{ms\(u ms\(b According to the downward closure, the 3 itemsets a b c and a b d will be pruned even though their supports may be larger than m\(c and ms\(d respectively To solve this problem we follow the sorted closure property in 7 First all items within an itemset are sorted in increasing order of their minimum supports and a sorted itemset, called frontier set F  aj ai uj2   ai is facilitated to generate the set of candidate 2-itemsets where a  min{m\(uj a 2ms\(aj ms\(aj I ms\(aj I ms\(uj2 I   s ms\(aj sup\(aj 2 ms\(aj 1 I i 5 1 For Ck k 2 3 the candidate generation is not changed For details on the mining of multi-support, generalized association rules, please refer to  161 4.2 Update of multi-support generalized associa tion rules As the pioneer work in 3 stated the primary chal lenge of devising effective association rules mainte nance algorithm is how to reuse the original large item sets and avoid the possibility of re-scanning the original database DB Let lDBl denote the number of transaction records in the original database DB pbl be the number of transaction records in the incremental database d6 and I UDI be the number of transaction records in the whole updated database UD containing db and DB For a sorted k-itemset A  al a   ar with ms\(al 5 ms\(uz 5  5 ms\(ak we define its support counts in db as 0-7803-7078-3/0U$10.00 C IEEE Page 12

3.2 Rule Sets Definition 3.5 Given two rules i and rma5 where i is a specialization of I a rule set  i T  rep resents the set of all rules I such that I is a specialization of T and a generalization of i i and I are called min-rule and max-rule of the rule set respectively Looking ahead, the number of valid rules can be very large but we will often be able to use a small number of rule sets to summarize all valid rules 4 Our Approach Given a sequence of snapshots our objective is to find the set of temporal association rules that meet the user specified thresholds for support density and strength This problem can be transformed into a problem of identifying clusters in a high dimensional space Two phases involved are involved in finding the temporal association rules 1 After partitioning each attribute domain into b base in tervals find all subspace\clusters with respect to the density threshold 2 Based on identified clusters find all valid rule sets 4.1 Cluster Discovery We first find all dense base cubes in a bottom-up fashion and then generate clusters by coalescing adjacent dense base cubes 3 141 The Apriori property holds on the density met ric 3 141 and can be restated into the following properties that are directly used in pruning the evolution space Property4.1 Let E  Ai E Z1,u1  Ai E Z2,u2  Zj+l uj+1      Ai E Zk,uk be two evolutions where 1 _ j 5 IC 5 m For a given sequence of snapshots R the density of E over R is less than or equal to that of E In the above property E contains a subsequence of inter vals specified in E E can be viewed as a projection of E onto an evolution space of lower dimensionality Property 4.2 Given a sequence of snapshots R the density of an evolution conjunction E\(A1 n E\(A2 n    n E\(An is less than or equal to the density of the conjunction of any    Ai E Z,,U and E  Ai E lj,~j  Ai E subsetof{E\(AI E\(A2    E\(An Similar to Property 4.1 Property 4.2 states that the den sity of an evolution conjunction is less than or equal to the density of any of its projections onto an evolution space of lower dimensionality Based on these two prop erties a level-wise dynamic programming 7 algorithm can be used to find all dense base cubes In Figure 4 BaseCube\(i m denotes the set of base cubes of evolution conjunctions involving i distinct attributes and having length m If the density of a base cube bc in BaseCube\(i m sat isfies the density threshold then by Property 4.1 both of bc's projections in BaseCube\(i m  1 have to satisfy the threshold as well In addition by Property 4.2 all bc's pro jections in BaseCube\(i  1 m must also satisfy the density threshold Level n+t-1 Cup 0    Property 3.1  Property 3.2 Level n+t-2  ky 1 ByCuv.n 1-1   Level 1 B&Che\(l 1 Figure 4 Base Cube Lattice Therefore, beginning from the set of all base intervals, at each successive level j we compute the set of dense base cubes in BaseCube\(i,j  i  1 for all 1 5 i 5 j until such a level that the set of dense base cubes at the previous level is empty The set BaseCube\(i m is examined during the i  m  1 scan of the data Let 0 be the maximum value of i  m  1 for all dense base cubes where i and m are the number of involved attributes and the evolution length of a base cube respectively Then the algorithm makes 0 passes over the database Let y  i x m be the highest dimensionality of any dense base cube2 Then the algorithm is exponential with respect to y since all of its projections of this dense base cube onto a subset of these y dimensions are also dense It follows that the computational complexity of this step is O\(Bx I R I cy for a small constant c where 1 R I is the data size After we find all dense base cubes a set of clusters can be formed by linking adjacent base cubes This step is equiva lent to finding connected component in a graph Each dense base cube is mapped to a graph vertex and there is an edge between two vertices if the corresponding dense base cubes are adjacent i.e they share a common face A depth-first traversal through this graph would be able to find all clusters In fact any algorithm proposed for efficiently comput ing subspace clusters can be adopted in this phase We will not elaborate on them in this paper due to space limitations Since every valid rule has to satisfy the density requirement 2Note that y  0 in general 289 


we only need to explore these clusters in the second phase In addition we will not examine a cluster if its support is less than the user specified threshold because no rule de rived from this cluster can meet the required support 4.2 Temporal Association Rule Discovery Let SUPPORT STRENGTH and E be the user spec ified thresholds for support strength and density respec tively The properties of strength will be shown to enable us to find all temporal association rules efficiently Let AI Az    A be a subset of attributes The space of evo lution conjunctions E\(A1 n E\(A2 n  n E\(A of length m is an m x n dimensional space Our objective is to find all valid rule sets E\(A1 n E A2 n   n E Ak 1 n E\(Ak+l  n    n E\(A U E\(Ak for each possible choice for the right hand side attribute Ak Note that in contrast to the previous algorithm proposed in 6 our approach treats the attribute on the right hand side of a rule in a similar man ner to the handling of left hand side attributes As a result it avoids the necessity of examining the left hand side at tributes repeatedly for each possible value of the right hand side A significant performance advantage over the previous approach is then achieved as demonstrated in Section 5 It is obvious that given an attribute Ak as the right hand side, only one rule corresponds to each evolution cube whose strength can be calculated uniquely In the following discussion, without loss of generality, we assume that Ak is on the right hand side of the rule and rule\(c and cube\(r are used to denote the corresponding rule of evolution cube c and the corresponding evolution cube of rule r respectively As we mentioned before due to the density requirement, we only need to examine rules whose corresponding evaluation cubes are enclosed entirely by some cluster The finest gran ularity rule we consider is the rule that corresponds to only one dense base cube We regard such rules as base rules The following two properties \(which are proven in  131 are used to guide the rule discovery process in each cluster The final result is the union of all valid rule sets discovered in each cluster Property4.3 For any rule r there exists a base rule brj which is a specialization of r and whose strength is at least that of T This property is illustrated in Figure 5\(a Basically it says that any valid rule has to be a generalization of some base rule whose strength is at least STRENGTH Then for this cluster, we only need to examine rules which are gen eralizations of the set of base rule\(s BR whose strengths are at least STRENGTH Let R be this set of rules, each of which is a generalization of some subset of base rule in BR and whose corresponding evolution cube is enclosed by the given cluster R contains all potential valid rules which can be discovered from this cluster The following property can be utilized to prune R further r h5 a Property 4.3 b Property 4.4 Figure 5 Properties for Strength Property 4.4 For any two rules r and r\222 where r\222 is a spe cialization of I and the strength of r\222 i,s less than that of r there exists another base rule bri which is a specialization of r but not r\221 and whose strength is greater than that of r As illustrated in Figure 5\(b this property implies that if the strength of a rule r\222 is below the threshold STRENGTH then the strength of any generalization of TI denoted by r is below STRENGTH unless r con tains some other base rule bri whose strength is greater than STRENGTH This suggests that we can prune R further by skipping those rules which are generalizations of r\222 but which do not contain any other base ruk in BR Since each rule in R is a generalization of some base rule\(s in BR for any two rules r E R and bri E BR we say that r contains br iff the evolution cube of bri is enclosed by that of r Rules in R can be divided into groups such that rules in the same group contain the same subset of base rules in BR If there are g base rules in BR then there are 29  1 distinct subsets of BR and hence R consists of 29  1 groups one for each subset Moreover the set of evolu tion cubes corresponding to rules in the same group occupy a continuous region in the search space. For example in Fig ure 6 BR   bl  b2    bg  are the set of base rules whose strengths are above the threshold BR\222  b3 b4 is a sub set of BR The light shaded area between those two solid contours in Figure 6 corresponds to the region for the set of evolution cubes, denoted by SE which are generaliza tions of b3 and bq but not others in BR SEC stands for Set of Evolution Cubes Any evolution cube that contains the inner contour and is enclosed by the outer contour belongs to SEC34 All rules whose corresponding evolution cubes are in SEC34 belong to the same group Therefore each cluster can be viewecl as the union of a set of regions each of which contains the set of evolution cubes corresponding to rules belonging to the same group In our algorithm each such region is examined in turn so that the space can be pruned efficiently 290

at a slower pace with respect to the number of base inter vals When we choose the number of base intervals to be 100 in the TAR algorithm, the response time is still within an acceptable length but 90 recall can be achieved One of the reasons that TAR has a significant better per formance is that the strength threshold is merely used to verify whether a rule is valid in the SR and LE algorithms whereas the strength is used to prune the search space in the TAR algorithm In turn, the set of candidate rules searched by the TAR algorithm is much smaller than others and hence the response time is improved Figure 7\(b shows the re sponse time of the three algorithms as a function of the strength In this test, the support and density thresholds are set to 5 and 2 respectively and there are 100 base inter vals on each domain The response time of the SR and LE remain constant because they do not use strength as a tool to prune the search space. However in the TAR algorithm the strength threshold is utilized to prune the search space, thus the performance is improved 5.2 Real Data Set We also ran the TAR algorithm on a real data set Each object represents a person The attributes are the age, the title of that person, the salary of that person family status sin gle, married, head of household and the distance between the person\222s house and a major city The distance is com puted based on the zip codes We selected all attributes as interesting There are 20,000 objects and 10 snapshots The snapshot was taken once a year from 1986 to 1995 We set the number of base intervals to be 100 and the thresholds for support density, and strength to be 3 i.e 600 objects 2 and 1.3 respectively It took approximately 260 seconds to mine the rules A total of 347 rule sets were discovered Due to space limita tion we only can present a few of mined rules here One rule discovered is that 223People receiving a raises tend to move further away from the city center.\224 This rule might be ex plained by the price of a house in the suburbs being more expensive and the area being more desirable to high income family The other is that 223People with a salary in the range between 70,000 to lOO,OOO get a raise the range of the raise will likely be from $7,000 to 15,000.\224 6 Conclusions In this paper we studied the problem of discovering cor relations among temporal evolutions numerical attributes The temporal association rules are introduced to describe this type of relationships Three parameters support strength and density are employed to qualify the validity of a rule We also devise an algorithm that can efficiently find the set of rules based on user specified thresholds In particular, sub space clustering is employed and some special properties on strength metric are proven and utilized to prune the search space further.

This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
