1999 IEEE lntemational Fuzzy Systems Conference Proceedings August 22-25 1999 Seoul Korea FARM A Data Mining System for Discovering Fuzzy Association Rules Wai-Ho Au Keith C.C. Chan Department of Computing The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong E-mail  cswhau cskcchan comp.polyu.edu.hk Abstract In this paper we introduce a novel technique called FARM, for mining fuzzy association rules FARM employs linguistic terms to represent the revealed regularities and exceptions The linguistic representation is especially useful when those rules discovered are presented to human experts for examination because of the affinity with the human knowledge representations The definition 
of linguistic terms is based on fuzzy set theory and hence we call the rules having these terms fuzzy association rules The use of fuzzy technique makes FARM resilient to noises such as inaccuracies in physical measurements of real-life entities and missing values in the databases Furthermore FARM utilizes adjusted difference analysis which has the advantage that it does not require any user-supplied thresholds which are often hard to determine In addition to this interestingness measure FARM has another unique feature that the conclusions of a fuzzy association rule can contain linguistic terms Our technique also provides a mechanism to allow quantitative values he inferred from fuzzy association rules Unlike other data mining techniques that can only 
discover association rules between different discretized values FARM is able to reveal interesting relationships between different quantitative values Our experimental results showed that FARM is capable of discovering meaningful and useful fuzzy association rules in an effective manner from a real-life database Keywords data mining knowledge discovery in databases fuzzy association rules, linguistic terms interestingness measure linguistic representation makes those rules discovered to he much natural for human experts to understand The definition of linguistic terms is based on fuzzy set theory and hence we call the rules having these terms fuuy association rules Unlike other data mining algorithms e.g 
l 111 which utilize user-supplied thresholds to identify interesting associations FARM employs an objective interestingness measure called adjusted difference 2-5 to mine fuzzy association rules The use of this technique has the advantage that it does not require any user-supplied thresholds which are often hard to determine Furthermore FARM also has the advantage that it allows us to discover both positive and negative association rules A positive association rule tells us that a record having certain attribute value or linguistic term will also have another attribute value or linguistic term whereas a negative association rule tells us that a record having certain attribute value or linguistic term will not have another attribute 
value or linguistic term Many data mining algorithms e.g I 111 require the conclusions of rules to be crisp and hence quantitative values cannot be inferred from those rules To be more effective, FARM is able to deal with class boundaries that are fuzzy and to associate qualitative attribute values with quantitative values This provides a mechanism for FARM to allow quantitative values be inferred Such mechanism equipped our technique with a unique feature that interesting associations between different quantitative attribute values can be revealed whereas other data mining techniques can only discover association rules between different discretized intervals 1 Introduction 2 Related 
Work An important topic in data mining research is concerned with the discovery of association rules I An association rule describes an interesting relationship among different attributes and we refer to such relationship as an association in this paper Existing algorithms e.g Ill involve discretizing the domains of quantitative attributes into intervals so as to discover quantitative association rules These intervals may not be concise and meaningful enough for human experts to easily obtain nontrivial knowledge from those rules discovered Instead of using intervals we introduce a novel technique called FARM uzzy  Association Rule Miner which employs linguistic terms to represent the revealed regularities and exceptions The An example 
of an association rule is 22390 of transactions that contain bread also contain butter 3 of all transactions contain both of these items.\224 The 90 is referred to as the confidence and the 3 the support of the rule Let I  il i2  i be a set of binary attributes called items and The a set of transactions Each transaction t E Tis represented as a binary vector with t[k  1 if t contains item ix and t[k  0 otherwise 
fork  1 2  m An association rule is defined as an implication of the form X a r where X c I Y c I and X n Y   The rule X  Y holds in T with support defined as Pr\(X U Y and confidence defined as Pr\(Y I X An association rule is interesting if and only if its support and confidence is greater than some user 0-7803-5406-0/99/$10.00 2211999 IEEE Ill-I217 


supplied threshold Association rules of such type are often referred to as boolean association rules Since boolean association rules are defined over binary data they are rather restrictive in many different areas and hence a lot of recent effort has been put into the mining of quantitative association rules 1111 Quantitative association rules are defined over quantitative and categorical attributes In  111 the values of categorical attributes are mapped to a set of consecutive integers and the values of quantitative attributes are first discretized into intervals using equi-depth partitioning if necessary and then mapped to consecutive integers to preserve the order of the valueslintervals And as a result both categorical and quantitative attributes can be handled in a uniform fashion as a set of attribute integer value pairs With the mappings defined in  111 a quantitative association rule is mapped to a set of boolean association rules After the mappings the algorithms for mining boolean association rules e.g l is then applied to the transformed data set For the mining algorithms such as that described in  1 111 to determine if an association rule is interesting its support and confidence have to be greater than some user supplied thresholds A weakness of such approach is that many users do not have any idea what the thresholds should be If it is set too high a user may miss some useful rules but if it is set too low the user may he overwhelmed by many irrelevant ones Furthermore the intervals in quantitative association rules may not he concise and meaningful enough for human experts to obtain nontrivial knowledge Fuuy linguistic summaries introduced in I21 express knowledge in linguistic representation which is natural for people to comprehend An example of linguistic summaries is the statement about half of people are middle aged In addition to fuzzy linguistic summaries an interactive top down summary discovery process which utilizes fuuy is-a hierarchies as domain knowledge has been described in 9 This technique aims at discovering a set of generalized tuples such as technical writer documentation In databases which consist of both quantitative and categorical attributes 3 FARM for Mining Fuzzy Association Rules A first-order fuzzy association rule can be defined as a fuzzy association rule involving one linguistic term in its antecedent a second-order fuzzy association rule can be defined as a fuzzy association rule involving two linguistic terms in its antecedent and a third-order fuzzy association rule can be defined as a fuzzy association rule involving three linguistic terms in its antecedent etc To perform search more effectively we propose to use an evolutionary algorithm FARM is therefore capable of mining fuzzy association rules in large databases by an iterative process 3.1 Linguistic Terms Given a set of records D each of which consists of a set of attributes J I Iz  In where I I  I can be quantitative or categorical For any record d E D d[IJ denotes the value i in d for attribute I t J For any quantitative attribute I E J let dom\(f  lv U c 93 denote the domain of the attribute A set of linguistic terms can be defined over the domain of each quantitative attribute Let  r  I 2  s be linguistic terms associated with some quantitative attribute I t J 4 is represented by a fuzzy set L defined on dom\(f whose membership function is pL such that The fuzzy sets L r  1 2    sv are then defined as for all i E dom\(f The degree of compatibility of i t dom\(f with some linguistic term  is given by U i  Ly  contrast to association rules which involve implications between different attributes fuzzy linguistic summaries and  For  any categorical attribute I E J let different attributes The idea of implication has not been taken into consideration and hence these techniques are not developed for the task of rule discovery can define a set of]inguistic terms   1 2  m for IvE Jwhere  is represented by a fuzzy set L such that The aoolicabilitv of fuzzv modeling techniaues to data L  mining hai'also been discussed in SI Civen'a series of Y fuzzy sets a 22   a conditional context-sensitive F c-M FCM method is le to reveal the rule Using the above technique we can represent the original attributes J using a set of linguistic terms L  based models within a family of patterns by considering I v  1 2 where S  m for their vicinity in a feature space along with the similarity of categorical attributes Each linguistic term is represented by the values assumed by a certain conditional variable a fuzzy set and hence we have a set of fuzzy sets L  L I context SI Nevertheless the conditional FCM method v 1 2  n r 1 2  S Given arecord d t D and can only manipulate quantitative attributes and it is for this a linguistic term  E L which is represented by a fuzzy reason that this technique is inadequate to deal with set L E L the degree of membership of the values in 4 n r  1 2  Ill-1218

whereas the second one says that very high capital of agriculture is associated with high capital of transportation Based on these two rules it is reasonable that both of these two factors is related to high capital of transportation It is exactly what the third rule says The fact that the weight of evidence of the third rule is substantially greater than the weight of evidence of the first and the second rules means that the capital of transportation is more likely to he high when both the investment in construction and the capital of agriculture are very high at the same time Let us consider the following fuzzy association rule as well 1ncome-of;ndumy  Very-low A Capirol-of-curnmerce-wdlfood-dr-beveroge  Very-low A Capiral-o~comrnerce-and-fuud-&-6~\224  Very-low Copiral-of-rmnsporrorion  Moderole 4.80 This rule states that there will not even he moderate capital of transportation when the income of industry and the overall and the self used capital of commerce and food  beverage are very low This rule is an example of negative association rules It should he noted that existing algorithms e.g I 111 are unable to discover negative associations The ability of FARM to mine negative association rules is another unique feature of it Among the attributes in the database one of them called Capital-oftransportation is identified as the class attribute for further experimentation Of the 280 records 220 are randomly selected for training and the others are used for testing The attribute Capital-oftransportation is quantitative and the predictions on this attribute are therefore of quantitative values Unfortunately many data mining techniques e.g I 111 which can only classify a record into appropriate category are unable to give quantitative values as predictions As a result, they are not readily applicable to this task On the contrary by representing attribute Capital-oftransportafion with a set of linguistic terms FARM is able to produce predictions which are of quantitative values The root mean squared error calculated by 11 over the class attribute Capital-of transportation for the database is equal to 4.5 In other words the predictions produced by our algorithm deviated from the target values by 4.5 in average 6 Conclusions We presented a novel algorithm called FARM which employs linguistic terms to represent the revealed regularities and exceptions in this paper The definition of linguistic terms is based on fuzzy set theory and hence we call the rules having these terms fuzzy association rules Unlike other algorithms which discover association rules based on the use of some user supplied threshold such as minimum support and minimum confidence FARM employs adjusted difference analysis to identify interesting associations among attributes without using any user supplied thresholds FARM also has unique features that it is able to discover both positive and negative associations and it uses a confidence measure, called weight of evidence to represent the uncertainty associated with the fuzzy association rules Furthermore FARM has another unique feature that quantitative values can he inferred from fuzzy association rules This allows interesting associations between different quantitative values to be revealed 7 References R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami 224Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases,\224 in Pror of the ACM SIGMOD Int\222l Con Washington D.C May 1993 pp 207-216 W.-H Au and K.C.C.

single bond  aromatic bond single bOnd  aromatic bDnd d CBO Figure 9 Two fragments extracted from a sei of steroids On the left, single and aromatic bonds were treated as different bond types. on the right they were treated as the same bond type 3.4 Treatment of Aromatic Bonds An important aspect of molecular fragment mining is the treatment of aromatic rings Since ammaticity is not clearly defined and can be modeled differently i.e explicit aro matic bonds vs alternating single and double bonds it is desirable to be able to take it into account throughout the mining process itself We achieve this by modeling aro matic bonds as either single or double bonds with a flag that indicates aromaticity This allows us to choose to ignore this flag during mining and hence to find fragments that contain either aromatic or single resp double bonds The following example illustrates why this is desirable Using a small set of steroid compounds we derived frag ments that occur in ail of them support=100%\using the standard algorithm Figure 9 left shows the correspond ing fragment Note how only two rings with an incomplete third ring are discovered of the four ring structure that is typical for steroids However if we model aromatic bonds as single+flag and allow the algorithm to ignore this flag the resulting fragment contains all four rings see Figure 9 right For some steroids this fourth ring consists of sin gle bonds while others have an aromatic ring at this posi tion However most chemists still regard this as the same 4 ring structure Such selective 223tolerance\224 against some mis matches can therefore make the presented algorithm more useful for real applications 4 Conclusions We presented an algorithm to find relevant molecular frag ments in large chemical structure databases The algorithm allows us to focus on fragments that help to discriminate be tween different classes of molecules The underlying search method, which is based on a depth first search with struc tural pruning makes it possible to find such fragments effi ciently without the need for frequent reembeddings of frag ment candidates, which is a known problem of previously reponed approaches We have shown how the proposed method finds relevant fragments using data from a well known HIV-screening compound database The extracted fragments successfully model several of the activity classes known for this dataset Future work will focus on making the presented approach more meaningful for the underlying application In partic ular finding fragments that match exactly is not of prime interest to chemists As demonstrate above some types of ring structures are considered functionally equivalent which should be taken into account by the search algorithm as well We are currently exploring ways to include such 223fuzziness\224 into the underlying search algorithm directly References I R Agrawal T Imielienski and A Swami.

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
