Association Rules Mining for Name Entity Recognition Indra Budi Computer Science Faculty, University of Indonesia indra@cs.ui.ac.id StÈphane Bressan School of Computing, National University of Singapore steph@nus.edu.sg Abstract We propose a new name entity class extraction method based on association rules. We evaluate and compare the performance of our method with the state of the art maximum entropy method. We show that our method consistently yields a higher precision at a competitive level of recall. This result makes our method particularly suitable for tasks whose requirements 
emphasize the quality rather than the quantity of results 1. Introduction The work presented in this paper 1 is part of a larger effort to develop information retrieval and linguistic systems, tools, and techniques for an Indonesian Digital Library \(see h e application that m o tivates this  research requires that semantic structures in XML or RDF be extracted from and superimposed on a corpus of documents written in the Indonesian language. Another motivation is the Semantic Web \(abstract representation of data on the World Wide Web\can be achieved by 
extracting sem antic struct ure  from those doc um ents.  The  natural first step of this project consists in identifying name entities from the texts in the corpus Name Entity Recognition \(NER\ation extraction task that is concerned with the recognition and classification of name entity from e entities classes are, for instance, locations, person named organization named, dates, and money amounts. To terms and expressions in the text correspond the entities they represent. For example, in the sentence British Foreign Office Minister O'Brien \(right\ and President Megawati pose for photographers at the Palace a name entity 
recognition process looking for named persons and locations would identify the two persons O'Brien and Megawati and the location Palace This recognition can be based on a variety of features of the terms, the sentence, the text and its syntax and could leverage external sources of information such as thesauri and dictionaries, for instance. In the example, a system may have applied a simple rule guessing that the capitalized 1 An extended version of this paper is available as [8 words directly following the terms 
P resident or  Minister are names of persons In this paper, we propose a method for name entity class recognition based on such rules in the form of association rules. The association rules defining the patterns of syntax and term features potentially defining the classes are mined from a training set of documents The rest of the paper is organized as follow. We present and discuss some background and related work on name entity class recognition in the next section. The method is presented in section 3 in which we detail the learning or mining phase and the testing and tagging 
phase. We evaluate and compare our method with the state of the art maximum entropy method 4 Finally we conclude and identify the next steps of our research 2 Background and Related Work The first family of approaches to name entity recognition relies on the hand crafting of models and techniques for the recognition of entity classes. Generally the models consist of a set of patterns using grammatical e.g. word precedence\nd orthographic features \(e.g. capitalization\bination with dictionaries and thesauri. An example pattern in this type of system is the one we have suggested in our 
introductory example: çIf a proper noun follows a personês title, then the proper noun is a personês name In this family of approaches Appelt et al. propose a name identification system based on carefully hand 13 uses extensive specialized resources such as gazetteers, and white and yellow pages. Morgan, for the same purpose uses a highly sophisticated linguistic an These approaches are relying on manually coded rules and manually compiled corpora. They often yield prohibitive development and maintenance costs Furthermore, for cost reduction and effectiveness reasons 
they are often domain and language specific and do not necessarily adapt well to new domains and languages The alternative to hand-crafted approaches is the use of data mining, knowledge discovery and machine learning techniques. Both Sekine n d Bennett [4  propose name identification systems based on decision trees. The decision trees in both approaches use such Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering \(WISEê03 0-7695-1999-7/03 $17.00 © 2003 IEEE 


features as part-of-speech, character, as well as dictionaries. Sekineês approach uses a single decision tree to compute the probability of a term to represent a given class while Bennetês approach combines multiple decision trees. Bikel in the popular Nymble system proposes a method based on the hidden markov model   The maximum entropy approach to NER relies on the general maximum entropy technique for estimating probability distribution. Borthwick word identification system built around a maximum entropy framework. The system uses a variety of knowledge sources, such as orthographic, lexical, section and dictionary features, to make tagging decisions. Chie  uses maximum entropy and combines the local features we have mentioned before with features global to the text such as abbreviations in subsequent sentences 3. Association Rule-based  NER 3.1. Mining Association Rules for NER Association rules and association rule mi  received much attention in the last decade in the database and data mining community. The model and techniques have found many applications in a variety of domains We mention for illustration results on Web and on query expansion in information ret  one of the author An traditional association rule is a relationship of the form: X Y, where X and Y are sets of items from the dataset to be studied. Each association rule is assigned a support factor and a confidence factor. The support is the ratio of the number of items in X and Y over the total number of items; The confidence is the ratio of the number of items in X and Y over the number items in X The mining of association rules consists in extracting from the databases all such rules with support and confidence greater than or equal to a user-specified support and confidence  In the name extraction task the datasets are documents which are sequences of terms with features and name classes. We use the set of features proposed by  W e consid er the seven nam e classes  considered in the standard MUC-7 benchm for the test on MUC-7 \(English\ed person named, organization named, dates, times monetary amount, and percentages, and three name classes for the Indonesian corpus: location named, person named, organization named  The items we consider are occurrences of terms However the sets X and Y can be described in terms of terms, sequences of terms, features and name classes. In practice Y is the name class we wish to predict. Among all the possible forms for X, after informal empirical tests we settled to consider three types of rules. Let us consider a sequence of terms <t 1 t 2 where f 2 is feature of t 2 and nc 2 is the name class of t 2 we consider the following three types of association rules 1. <t 2 nc 2 support, confidence 2. <t 1 t 2 nc 2 support, confidence 3 t 1 f 2 nc 2 support, confidence We call rules of type 1 dictionary rules rules of type 2 bigram rules and rules of type 3 feature rules  Let us consider the example sentence Prof Hasibuan conducted a lecture on information retrieval  In a training corpus in which name classes are given, the annotations of the corpus indicate that the term  Hasibuan is name class of person  We  produce a dictionary rule of the form Hasibuan person_named\(Hasibuan with support and confidence depending on the number of occurrences of the term Hasibuan and the number of occurences of the term Hasibuan labelled in this entity class We produce a bigram rule of the  form Prof., Hasibuan person_named \(Hasibuan with support and confidence depending on the number of occurrences of the expression Prof. Hasibuan and the term Hasibuan labelled in this name  class We  produce a feature rule of the  form Prof Capitalized_word\(X person_named\(X with support and confidence depending on the occurrences of the expression Prof. X with X labelled in this feature and name classes 3.2. Using Association Rules for NER  The mined rules are considered for the name entity recognition task if their support and confidence is above user defined thresholds  We use the mined rules by type -dictionary, bigram or feature- independently or combined. For every pair of terms in the text, the name entity recognition association rule-based algorithm, presented in figure 3.2, determines the rule with minimum support and highest confidence to be used. Ties, which are rare, are broken with a random choice. Not so rare is the case for which no rule is available. In that situation, the special class not-a-name is assigned to the term  In this paper, although we have informally experimented with various combinations of the rules, we report the results of four interesting combinations of the three types of rules mined: the bigram rules alone, the combined bigram and dictionary rules, the feature rules alone and the combined feature and dictionary rules 4 Experimental Results Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering \(WISEê03 0-7695-1999-7/03 $17.00 © 2003 IEEE 


The maximum entropy method is implemented using the Java-based opennlp maximum entropy package http://maxent.sourforge.net the same machine In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our method we use the standard name entity recognition corpus, the MUC-7 co The corpus c ontains ne ws articles in the English language in which terms representing name entities of seven classes \(see section 3 have been labeled We use a training set of 200 articles to learn the association rules and a testing set of 100 articles The algorithm is implemented in C Table 4.2. Results of experiment with MUC-7 Tables 4.1 and 4.2 report the results of the experiments on the MUC-7 and Kompas corpora respectively The Association rule based methods consistently yields a higher precision than the corresponding maximum entropy based method The dictionary rules can be used in combination with the bigram or the feature rules to significantly increase the recall \(namely many terms occur without any particular contextual features The various combinations of features also seem to impact consistently in both association rule and maximum entropy based methods Figure 3.2 Recognition algorithm Rule Association Maximum Entropy Rule Recall Precision Recall Precision Bigram 34.37 93.21 57.40 65.03 Feature 44.84 67.75 49.56 58.99 Bigram+Dict 60.44 89.59 53.72 69.48 Feature+Dict 66.34 83.43 43.70 60.89  for every pair of terms t 1 t 2 find the set R of rules X => nc such that t 1 t 2 matches X and support and confidence are above threshold if R is not empty then Chose in R the rule X => nc with highest confidence Assign nc as the name class of t 2 Else Assign not-a-name as name class of t 2 endfor We also ran experiments on a corpus of news articles in the Indonesian language. The corpus consists of 55 manually labelled news articles collected for eight days, between April 2nd 2001 and April 10th 2001, from the online version of the Indonesian newspaper Kompas http://www.kompas.com  We took the articles vary in size from 201 to 1532 terms. As mentioned above we use three name classes For the Indonesian corpu s with only three name entity classes, the association rule based methods have difficulties to reach a competitive level of recall Table 4.2 Results of experiment with Kompas Rule Association Maximum Entropy Rule Recall Precision Recall Precision Bigram 28.45 86.52 52.53 72.14 Feature 51.58 77.65 58.39 70.01 Bigram+Dict 48.42 82.61 78.09 70.20 Feature+Dict 62.80 81.35 63.10 61.13 The effectiveness of the method is measured in terms of recall and precision. Recall is defined as the number of correct responses divided by number of answers Precision is defined as the number of correct responses divided by the number of responses. A response is a term labeled by the algorithm with a name class. An answer is the name class of the term as labeled in the corpus. A response is correct if it corresponds to an answer 5 Conclusions and Future Work In this series of experiment we compare our method with the maximum entropy method. A maximum entropy solution to NER is find ing the probability of p\(f|h for any f from the space of possible futures \(seven name entities as MUC-7 h from the space of possible histories. A çhistoryé in maximum entropy is all of the conditioning data which enables to make a decision among the space of futures, in this term is token features We have presented a new name entity class recognition method based on association rules We compared our method with the maximum entropy method. Our experiments showed that association rules consistently yield a higher precision than the maximum entropy method. In the English corpus, under the appropriate combination of types of rules it is possible to improve the recall so that the association rule method is strictly more effective that the maximum entropy For each type of association rules or combination of types of association rules that we use, we use the corresponding terms and features in the history of the maximum entropy method one term for the dictionary method, two consecutive terms for the bigram method and a term and the feature of its successor for the feature method The next step in our project is to devise a method to reconstruct structured elements from the elementary name entities identified Our target language is XML. To illustrate our idea, let us consider the motivating example from which we wish to extract an XML document describing the meeting taking place Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering \(WISEê03 0-7695-1999-7/03 $17.00 © 2003 IEEE

on the frequency list of the items. As soon as a transaction is added, the frequency list could be changed and the FP-Tree may require a significant rearrangement of nodes to maintain the structure 6. Conclusion We propose a novel data structure, CATS Tree and an algorithm to build it. The algorithm FELINE is also proposed to mine frequent patterns from CATS Trees There are many advantages of CATS Tree algorithms over the existing algorithms. 1\ce a CATS Tree is built, frequent pattern mining with different supports can be performed without rebuilding the tree The benefit of çbuild once, mine manyé increases with the number of frequent patterns mining performed, i.e interactive mining with different supports; the cost of CATS Tree construction is amortized over multiple frequent patterns mining. 2\ CATS Tree allows single pass frequent pattern mining. 3\ CATS Tree algorithms allow addition and deletion of transactions in the finest granularity, i.e., a single transaction f o r m o re details. Currently, there is no known and published algorithm that can provide the same functionalities efficiently. This makes CATS Tree algorithm suitable for real time transactional frequent pattern mining where modifications and frequent patterns mining are common Moreover, with the addition and deletion capability CATS trees algorithms are appropriate to mine transaction streams since one single scan of the data suffices [18   We have implemented CATS Tree algorithms and compared our approach with other algorithms. CATS Tree algorithms are shown to be efficient and scalable to large amount of transactions and outperform other algorithms in interactive setting 7.

optimization for larger transaction sizes and in cases where there are large number of candidate k itemsets 6 Conclusions In this paper e presented a parallel implementation of the Apriori algorithm on the SGI Power Challenge shared memory multi-processor We also discussed a set of optimizations which include optimized join and pruning computation balancing for candidate generation hash tree balancing and short-circuited subset checking We then presented experimental results on each of these Improvements of more than 40 were obtained for the computation and hash tree balancing The short-circuiting optimization was found to be extremely effective for databases with large transaction sizes Finally we reported the parallel performance of the algorithm While we d good speed-up we observed a need for parallel I/O techniques for further performance gains References  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Database mining A performance perspecti v e  I n IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engg  pages 5\(6 1993  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in lar ge databases In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1993  R Agra wal H Mannila R Srikant H T o i v onen and A I V erkamo F ast disco v ery of association rules In U F et al editor Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  MIT Press 1996  R Agra wal and J Shafer  P arallel mining of association rules design implementation and e xperience Technical Report RJ10004 IBM Almaden Research Center San Jose CA 95120 Jan 1996  R Agra wal and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Proc 20th VLDB Conf  Sept 1994  M Cierniak W  Li and M J Zaki Loop scheduling for heterogeneity  I n 4th IEEE Intl Symposium on High-Performance Distributed Computing also as URCS-TR 540 CS Dept Univ f Rochester  Aug 1995  M Holsheimer  M  K ersten H Mannila and H T o i v onen A perspecti v e on databases and data mining In 1st Intl Conf Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  Aug 1995  M Houtsma and A Swami Set-oriented mining of association rules In RJ 9567  IBM Almaden Oct 1993  H Mannila H T o i v onen and I V erkamo Ef 336cient algorithms for disco v ering association rules In AAAI Wkshp Knowledge Discovery in Databases  July 1994  J S P ark M Chen and P  S Y u  A n e f fecti v e hash based algorithm for mining association rules In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1995 17 Proceedings of the 1996 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing \(SC\22296 0-89791-854-1/96 $ 10.00 ACM
