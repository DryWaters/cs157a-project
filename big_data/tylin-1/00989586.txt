A Fast Algorithm to Cluster High Dimensional Basket Data  Carlos Ordonez Edward Omiecinski Norbert0 Ezquerra College of Computing Georgia Institute of Technology Abstract Clustering is a data mining problem that has received sig nificant attention by the database community. Data set size dimensionality and sparsity have been ident@ed as aspects that make clustering more dificult This work introduces a fast algorithm to cluster large binary data sets where data points have high dimensionality and most of their coordi nates are Zero 
This is the case with basket data transactions containing items, that can be represented as sparse binary vectors with very high dimensionality An experimental sec tion shows performance, advantages and limitations of the proposed approach 1 Introduction Clustering algorithms identify those regions that are more densely populated than others in multidimensional data 8 131 In general clustering algorithms partition the data set into several groups such that points in the same group are close to each other and points across groups are 
far from each other. It has been shown that high dimensionality lo data sparsity  11 and noise 2 make clustering a harder problem In this work we focus on the problem of efficiently clus tering binary data sets that are sparse and have very high dimensionality This is precisely the case with basket data transactions where transactions contain combinations of a few items out of thousands of items Our approach can be used as an alternative data mining technique to association rule discovery 3 1.1 
Overview We introduce a fast clustering algorithm for sparse high dimensional binary data basket data based on the well known Expectation-Maximization EM clustering algo rithm 7 17,6 131 The EM algorithmis a general statistical method of maximum likelihood estimation 7 14 171 In 223This work wassupported by grant LM 06726from the NationalLibrary of Medicine particular it can be used to perform clustering In our case we will use it to fit a mixture of Normal distributions to 
a sparse binary data set Our algorithm is designed to efficiently handle large prob lem sizes as typically encountered in modern database sys tems and it is guaranteed to produce high quality solutions as it will be shown by our experiments The proposed clustering algorithm builds a statistical model so that the user can understand transactions at a high level Items are mapped to binary dimensions and transac tions are thus mapped to binary data points The basic idea is to group similar transactions Clusters 
of transactions can have different interpretations. Each cluster can tell us what the typical transaction looks like; this is precisely the mean or average of transactions per cluster Each cluster describes which items commonly appear together in each transaction Since cluster centroids are averages of binary numbers the mean of a certain dimension can be interpreted as a proba bility or a percentage If transactions are not well clustered in certain dimensions this can be explained by the deviation they have from the mean The user will be able to compare several cluster models 
by looking at a quantity measuring their quality 1.2 Contributions and paper outline This is a summary of our contributions We introduce a novel algorithm to cluster very high dimensional and sparse binary data sets The proposed solution does not require complex data structures to store patterns or model param eters but only matrices that in general can fit in memory From a quality point of view the algorithm computes highly accurate clusters From a performance point of view the 
algorithm is fast having linear time complexity in data set size in transaction size and in the desired number of clusters The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 provides definitions and statistical background Section 3 contains the algorithm to cluster high dimensional and sparse binary data sets Section 4 contains a brief experimental evaluation Section 5 discusses related work The paper concludes with section 6 0-7695-1 119-8/01 17.00 0 2001 IEEE 633

At level 0 we have available the tidsets for each item in F1 When we invoke FI-combine at this level we compute the diffset of y\222 denoted as d\(y\222 instead  Can ll+1 combine with other items in Cl FI-diffset-combine\(l+l A+1 1 c=0 2 for each  E Fj+l 3 yf  y 4 if level  0 then d\(y\222  t\(ll+l  t\(y 5 6 if u\(y\222 2 minsup 7 8 return C else d\(y\222  d\(y  d\(Ii+1 c  c U y\222 Figure 8 FI-combine Diffset Propagation of computing the tidset of y as shown in line 4 in Figure 7 That is d\(y\222  t\(z  t\(y The support of y\222 is now given as y\222  a  ld\(y\222 At subsequent levels we have available the diffsets for each element in the combine list.

Timings in the figures are based on total wall-clock time and include all preprocessing costs such as horizontal-to-vertical conversion in GenMax and Mafia The times reported also include the program output We believe our setup reflects realistic testing conditions as op posed to some previous studies which report only the CPU time or may not include output cost Benchmark Datasets We chose several real and syn thetic datasets for testing the performance of the the al 167

Both GenMax and MaxMiner return the exact MFI On chess we find that Mafia without PP is the fastest if one is willing to live with a superset of the MFI Mafia is about IO times faster than MaxMiner However notice how the running time of MafiaPP grows if one tries to find the exact MFI in a post-pruning step GenMax though slower than Mafia is significantly faster than MafiaPP and is about 5 times better than MaxMiner All methods, except MafiaPP show an exponential growth in running time since the y-axis is in log-scale this appears linear\faithfully fol lowing the growth of MFI with lowering minimum sup port as shown in the top center and right figures MafiaPP shows super-exponential growth and suffers from an ap proximately O IMF11  overhead in pruning non-maximal sets and thus becomes impractical when MFI becomes too large, i.e at low supports On pumsb we find that GenMax is the fastest, having a slight edge over Mafia It is about 2 times faster than Mafi aPP. We observed that the post-pruning routine in MafiaPP works well till around 0\(104 maximal itemsets Since at 60 minsup we had around that many sets, the overhead of post-processing was not significant With lower support the post-pruning cost becomes significant so much so that we could not run MafiaPP beyond 50 minimum support MaxMiner is significantly slower on pumsb a factor of 10 times slower then both GenMax and Mafia Type I results substantiate the claim that GenMax is an highly efficient method to mine the exact MFI It is as fast as Mafia on pumsb and within a factor of 2 on chess. Mafia on the other hand is very effective in mining a superset of the MFI Post-pruning in general is not a good idea, and GenMax beats MafiaPP with a wide margin over 100 times better in some cases, e.g chess at 20 On Type I data MaxMiner is noncompetitive Type I1 Datasets Connect and Pumsb Type I1 datasets as shown in Figure 12 are characterized by a left-skewed distribution of the maximal frequent pat terns i.e there is a relatively gradual increase with a sharp drop in the number of maximal patterns The mean pattern length is also longer than in Type I datasets it is around 16 or 17 The MFI cardinality is also drastically smaller than FI cardinality by a factor of lo4 or more in contrast for Type I data, the reduction was only lo2 The main performance trend for both Type I1 datasets is that Mafia is the best till the support is very low at which point there is a cross-over and GenMax outperforms Mafia MafiaPP continues to be favorable for higher sup ports but once again beyond a point post-pruning costs start to dominate MafiaPP could not be run beyond the plotted points MaxMiner remains noncompetitive about 10 times slower The initial start-up time for Mafia for creating the bit-vectors is responsible for the high offset at 50 support on pumsb GenMax appears to exhibit a more graceful increase in running time than Mafia Type I11 Datasets T1014 and T40110 As depicted in Figure 13 Type I11 datasets  the two synthetic ones  are characterized by an exponentially de caying distribution of the maximal frequent patterns Ex cept for a few maximal sets of size one the vast majority of maximal patterns are of length two A.fter that the number of longer patterns drops exponentially The mean pattern length is very short compared to Type I or Type I1 datasets it is around 4-6 MFI cardinality is not much smaller than the cardinality of all frequent patterns The difference is only a factor of 10 compared to a factor of 100 for Type I and a factor of 10,000 for Type 11 Comparing the running times we observe that MaxMiner is the best method for this type of data The breadth-first or level-wise search strategy used in MaxMiner is ideal for 168

Post-pruning non-maximal patterns typically has high overhead It works only for high support values, and MafiaPP cannot be run be yond a certain minimum support value GenMax integrates pruning of non-maximal itemsets in the process of mining using the novel progressive focusing technique along with other optimizations for superset checking GenMax is the best method for mining the exact MFI Our work opens up some important avenues of future work The IBM synthetic dataset generator appears to be too restrictive It produces Type I11 MFI distributions We plan to develop a new generator that the users can use to produce various kinds of MFI distributions This will help provide a common testbed against which new algorithms can be benchmarked Knowing the conditions under which a method works well or does not work well is an impor tant step in developing new solutions In contrast to pre vious studies we were able to isolate these conditions for the different algorithms For example we were able to im prove the performance of GenMax\222 to match MaxMiner on mushroom dataset Another obvious avenue of improving GenMax and Mafia is to efficiently handle Type I11 data It seems possible to combine the strengths of the three meth ods into a single hybrid algorithm that uses the horizontal format when required and uses bit-vectors/diffsets or per haps bit-vectors of diffsets in other cases or in combination We plan to investigate this in the future Acknowledgments We would like to thank Roberto Bayardo for providing us the MaxMiner algorithm and Johannes Gehrke for the MAFIA algorithm References R Agrawal C Aggarwal and V Prasad Depth First Gener ation of Long Patterns In ACM SIGKDD Con Aug 2000 R Agrawal et al Fast discovery of association rules In Advances in Knowledge Discovev and Data Mining AAA1 Press, 1996 R J Bayardo Efficiently mining long patterns from databases In ACM SIGMOD Con June 1998 D Burdick M Calimlim and J Gehrke MAFIA a maximal frequent itemset algorithm for transactional databases In Intl Con on Data Engineering Apr 2001 D Gunopulos H Mannila and S Saluja Discovering all the most specific sentences by randomized algorithms In Intl Conf on Database Theon\222 Jan 1997 J Han J Pei and Y Yin Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation In ACM SIGMOD Con May 2000 D.4 Lin and Z M Kedem Pincer-search A new algorithm for discovering the maximum frequent set In Intl Con Ex reridin Database Technology Mar 1998 D Yelfin An algorithm for dynamic subset and intersection testin  Theoretical Cornputer Science 129:397-406 1994 M J.!Zaki Generating non-redundant association rules In ACM SIGKDD Con Au 2000 M J Zaki and K Gouda.%ast vertical mining using Diffsets TR01-1,CSDe t,RPI,Mar.2001 M J Zaki and 2-J Hsiao CHARM An efficient algorithm for closed association rule mining TR 99-10 CS Dept RPI Oct. 1999 170

locally by the routing circuit of a node Because the routing algorithm is invoked multiple times while a packet is being routed the routing decision must be taken as fast as pos sible From this viewpoint it is important that the routing algorithm can be easily and efficiently rendered in hardware which favors the random routing algorithm over the greedy and minimal routing algorithms Besides being the most complex algorithm discussed in this paper the minimal routing algorithm includes a feature which precludes its distributed implementation in associa tion with wormhole routing namely its backtracking mech anism Distributed versions of the random and greedy al gorithms, however, can be used in combination with worm hole routing A near-minimal distributed routing algorithm which supports wormhole routing can be obtained by re moving the backtracking mechanism from Alg 3 Such an algorithm is likely to have computational complexity and average cost that lie between those of the greedy and the minimal routing algorithm Due to its non-deterministic nature the random routing algorithm also seems to be a good candidate for SCC net works employing distributed adaptive routing  1 I Adap tivity is desirable for example if the routing algorithm must dynamically respond to network conditions such as conges tion and faults Some degree of adaptivity is also possible in the greedy and minimal routing algorithms which in some cases can decide between paths of equal cost 7 Conclusion This paper compared the average cost and the complex ity of three different routing algorithms for the SCC graph We divided routes into three components \(lateral links MI local links and MB local links and showed that only the number of MB local links may be affected by the routing algorithm being considered Exact expressions for the aver age number of lateral links and the average number of MI local links were presented Also an upper bound for the average number of MZ local links was derived considering a random routing algorithm As a result a tight upper bound on the average distance of the SCC graph was obtained Simulation results for a random a greedy and a minimal routing algorithm were presented and compared with theo retical values The complexity of the proposed algorithms is respectively O\(n O\(n2 and O\(n3 where n is the dimensionality of the SCC grap.h The results under mini mal routing produce exact numerical values for the average distance of SCC for 3 5 n 5 9 Results for the greedy algorithm match those of the min imal algorithm for 3 2 n 5 4 The greedy algorithm also performs close to minimality for 5 5 n 5 9 and is an in teresting choice due to its O\(n2 complexity The random routing algorithm has an O\(n complexity and performs fairly well on the average but may introduce additional MB local links in the route under worst-case conditions Finally we discussed how each of the routing algorithms can be used in association with the wormhole routing switch ing technique Directions for future research in this area in clude an evaluation of requirements for deadlock avoidance e.g number of virtual channels References l S B Akers,D.

The data flows in continuously and is processed daily Mining association rules dynamically has the following benefits 267  223Real-time\224 data mining, that is, the rules are drawn from the latest transactions for reflecting the current commercial trends 267  Multilevel knowledge abstraction, which requires summarizing multiple partial results. For example association rules on the month or year basis cannot be concluded from daily mining results. In fact multilevel mining is incremental in nature 267  For scalability, incremental and distributed mining has become a practical choice Figure 3: Distributed rule mining Incremental association rule mining requires combining partial results. It is easy to see that the confidence and support of multiple rules may not be combined directly. This is why we treat them as \223views\224 and only maintain the association cube, the population cube and the base cube that can be updated from each new copy of volume cube. Below, we discuss several cases to show how a GDOS can mine association rules by incorporating the partial results computed at LDOSs 267  The first case is to sum up volume-cubes generated at multiple LDOSs. Let C v,i be the volume-cube generated at LDOS i The volume-cube generated at the GDOS by combining the volume-cubes fed from these LDOSs is 345   n i i v v C C 1  The association rules are then generated at the GDOS from the centralized C v  214  The second case is to mine local rules with distinct bases at participating LDOSs, resulting in a local association cube C a,I a local population cube C p,I  and a local base cube C b,i at each LDOS. At the GDOS, multiple association cubes, population cubes and base cubes sent from the LDOSs are simply combined, resulting in a summarized association cube and a summarized population cube, as 345   n i i a a C C 1   345   n i i p p C C 1  and 345   n i i b b C C 1  The corresponding confidence cube and support cube can then be derived as described earlier. Cross-sale association rules generated from distinct customers belong to this case In general, it is inappropriate to directly combine association cubes that cover areas a 1 205, a k to cover a larger area a In the given example, this is because association cubes record counts of customers that satisfy   customer product merchant time area Doe TV Dept Store 98Q1 California Doe VCR Dept Store 98Q1 California customer product merchant time area Doe VCR Sears 5-Feb-98 San Francisco Joe PC OfficeMax 7-Feb-98 San Francisco customer product merchant time area Doe TV Fry's 3-Jan-98 San Jose Smith Radio Kmart 14-Jan-98 San Jose Association   population      base          confidence      support cube               cube                cube         cube                cube LDOS LDOS GDOS 


the association condition, and the sets of customers contained in a 1 205, a k are not mutually disjoint. This can be seen in the following examples 214  A customer who bought A and B in both San Jose and San Francisco which are covered by different LDOSs , contributes a count to the rule covering each city, but has only one count, not two, for the rule A  336  B covering California 214  A customer \(e.g. Doe in Figure 3\who bought a TV in San Jose, but a VCR in San Francisco, is not countable for the cross-sale association rule TV  336 VCR covering any of these cities, but countable for the rule covering California. This is illustrated in Figure 3 6  Conclusions In order to scale-up association rule mining in ecommerce, we have developed a distributed and cooperative data-warehouse/OLAP infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to generate association rules with enhanced expressive power, by combining information of discrete commercial activities from different geographic areas, different merchants and over different time periods. In this paper we have introduced scoped association rules  association rules with conjoint items and functional association rules as useful extensions to association rules The proposed infrastructure has been designed and prototyped at HP Labs to support business intelligence applications in e-commerce. Our preliminary results validate the scalability and maintainability of this infrastructure, and the power of the enhanced multilevel and multidimensional association rules. In this paper we did not discuss privacy control in customer profiling However, we did address this issue in our design by incorporating support for the P3P protocol [1 i n  ou r data warehouse.

optimization for larger transaction sizes and in cases where there are large number of candidate k itemsets 6 Conclusions In this paper e presented a parallel implementation of the Apriori algorithm on the SGI Power Challenge shared memory multi-processor We also discussed a set of optimizations which include optimized join and pruning computation balancing for candidate generation hash tree balancing and short-circuited subset checking We then presented experimental results on each of these Improvements of more than 40 were obtained for the computation and hash tree balancing The short-circuiting optimization was found to be extremely effective for databases with large transaction sizes Finally we reported the parallel performance of the algorithm While we d good speed-up we observed a need for parallel I/O techniques for further performance gains References  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Database mining A performance perspecti v e  I n IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engg  pages 5\(6 1993  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in lar ge databases In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1993  R Agra wal H Mannila R Srikant H T o i v onen and A I V erkamo F ast disco v ery of association rules In U F et al editor Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  MIT Press 1996  R Agra wal and J Shafer  P arallel mining of association rules design implementation and e xperience Technical Report RJ10004 IBM Almaden Research Center San Jose CA 95120 Jan 1996  R Agra wal and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Proc 20th VLDB Conf  Sept 1994  M Cierniak W  Li and M J Zaki Loop scheduling for heterogeneity  I n 4th IEEE Intl Symposium on High-Performance Distributed Computing also as URCS-TR 540 CS Dept Univ f Rochester  Aug 1995  M Holsheimer  M  K ersten H Mannila and H T o i v onen A perspecti v e on databases and data mining In 1st Intl Conf Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  Aug 1995  M Houtsma and A Swami Set-oriented mining of association rules In RJ 9567  IBM Almaden Oct 1993  H Mannila H T o i v onen and I V erkamo Ef 336cient algorithms for disco v ering association rules In AAAI Wkshp Knowledge Discovery in Databases  July 1994  J S P ark M Chen and P  S Y u  A n e f fecti v e hash based algorithm for mining association rules In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1995 17 Proceedings of the 1996 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing \(SC\22296 0-89791-854-1/96 $ 10.00 ACM
