The extension of service into the in-building environments and in public pedestrian 
areas further enhance this trend This trend is no exception in the United States. With the availability of spectrum in the PCS Unlicense band it becomes apparent that standardization is required to provide cost-effective solutions for in-building business applications. This paper discuss the three user premise equipment wireless standards developed in TIA \(Telecommunications Industry Association The main purpose of this organization was to develop the standards for inter- vendor operability for operation in the US PCS Unlicense band The three user premise equipment wireless standards are PWT \(Personal Wireless Terminal 
PCI Personal Communication Interface and PACS Personal Access Communication System Operation in the unlicense band is first discussed Both voice or isochronous type services and data or asynchronous services are accommodated in the PCS unlicense band Different rules of access governs each service type A process of channel monitoring with a listen-before-transmit protocol is provided to allow for sharing of channels in the band This process also better know as the "etiquette rule or spectrum etiquette" together with standardization of the three over-the 
air protocols in TIA provides a significant new opportunity for the extension of personal communications for the in building business applications Introduction With the emergence of digital cordless telephony standards cordless systems with enhanced functionality such as CT2 CT2Plus, DECT, and PHS have been developed for wireless private branch exchanges \(WPBXs\But these standards are developed for European, Japanese or Canadian deployment with possible adapation to some Asian and Latin American countries. These standards without changes however will not work in the US spectrum CT2 and CT2Plus are FDMA 
digital standards developed for specific geographical area CT2 is currently deployed in Europe and Asia, CT2Plus is an enhancement to the CT2 standard and it is currently deployed in Canada DECT and PHS however are FDMA/TDMA digital standards designed for high capacity in-building usage DECT is currently deployed in Europe 0-7803-3692-5/96 0 1996 IEEE Currently PWT Personal Wireless Terminal PCI Personal Communications Interface and PACS Personal Access Communication system\wireless protocol standards has been standardized in TIA \(Telecommunications Industry 
Association TR41.6 with the aim of achieving industry wide interoperability for customer premise equipment for operation in the US PCS unlicense band Operation in the PCS Unlicensed Band The band 1850  1990 MHz in the lower 2 GHz has been designated for PCS operations. This band section between 1910 to 1930 MHz has been designated for the unlicensed PCS services. This is the middle band between the go and return channels of the licensed PCS assignments 
on either side. The main advantage of operating in the unlicense band over the license band is "it is free", or "almost free So long as the equipment is FCC certified the equipment can be deployed and turned on But during the initial days of spectrum clearing an organization call UTAM Unlicensed PCS ad-hoc committee for 2 GHz microwave Transition and Management may require a small fee before deployment can take place. Depending on the spectrum congestion in some areas deployment may not even be possible

The unlicensed band has been divided into two parts to accommodate two classes of device operation. These are for the isochronous \(voice and the asynchronous \(data\devices Isochronous devices require a regular repeated transmissions as typified by TDMA/TDD voice systems The asynchronous devices are those with no regular transmission pattern but which send high speed bursts of information when needed and can tolerate a delay before sending a burst Carrier spacing 1.250 MHz, 1910  30 MHz Peak transmit power 90 mW Carrier multiplex TDMA 24 slots per frame Frame length 10 ms Basic duplexing TDD using 2 slots on same W carrier Asynchronous data Synchronous voice 8  1.25 MHz frequency channeis 1910 1920 1930 The asynchronous devices have been assigned the sub-band between 1910 and 1920 MHz while the isochronous devices are assigned the segment from 1920  1930 MHz see figure above There is no channel assignment in the asynchronous band while in the synchronous band the band is divided into eight 1.25 MHz segments The etiquette uses the concept of an emission bandwidth to set the transmitter power level and emission limits for the devices. The basic concept is to limit the transmitter power to limit the duration of transmissions and to provide a "listen before transmit" protocol so that new transmitters defer to established traffic This set of rules has been called an etiquette or spectrum etiquette". The concept is that an existing user of the radio spectrum should be protected from interference from a new device. Thus all devices must listen on a channel to be sure it is free before beginning transmissions PWT PWT Personal Wireless Terminal Interoperability Standard is essentially the same as DECT in the higher layers. The lower layers are adapted for usage in the US unlicensed PCS band 1920  1930 MHz PWT is a micro-cell radio communication system that provides low  power radio cordless\access between portable parts and PWT\fixed parts at ranges up to a few hundred meters The range maybe extended through the use of in-band repeaters to distances of a few kilometers for applications such as fixed wireless access FWA\The basic technical characteristics are as follows Frequency band 1920  1930 MHz unlicensed I910  1920 MHz optional unlicensed PWT-E \(licensed 1850-1990 MHz Number of carriers 8 1920-1930 MHz 16 if implemented from 1910  1930 MHz Gross bit rate 1152 kbls Symbol rate 576 kbls Net channel rates 32 kb/s B  field \(traffic\per slot 6.4 kbls A  field control/signaling\per slot The PWT is designed for use in the US PCS unlicense band and is designed as a flexible interface to provide cost-effective communication services to high user density in picocells The standard is intended for wireless PBX, cordless telephony or wireless local loop It does support multiple bearer channels for speech and data transmission, handover, location registration and paging. Extensions to PWT allow it to be used in the licensed PCS bands for such applications as FWA. These extensions are known as PWT-E \(Enhanced Control Plane User Information. Piane Control Piane Llrar Information Plana DECT Layer Structure PWT Layer Structure PWT like DECT uses TDMA and TDD, with 12 slots per carrier in each direction. A PWT base station can support multiple handsets simultaneously with a single transceiver It can also allocate several bearers for a single call to provide high bandwidth communication The channel spacing in PWT is decreased to 1.25 MHz from the 1.728 MHz used in DECT. This is done to adhere to the FCC rules for channel spacing This change forced a change in the modulation scheme, from GFSK to a more narrow-band 7c/4 DQPSK The PWT provides 8 carriers in the 10 MHz band between 1920  1930 MHz A further 8 carriers may also be used in the 1910  1920 MHz sub-band, however, a different MAC layer access etiquette must be used for this sub-band The 959 


details of the MAC layer procedures to comply with the FCC etiquette for either sub-band are not given in the standard and must be developed by the manufacturers for compliance to the FCC rules PWT like DECT, uses 32 kb/s ADPCM speech coding Duplexing Carrier spacing kHz Number of carriers Bearer channelskarrier Channel bit rate kb/s Modulation Speech Coding kb/s Frame duration msec Peak handset TX power mw I PWT 1920  1930 TDD 1250 8 16 if 1910  30 12 1 152; 576 kbauds d4 DQPSK 32 10 90 DECT 1880 1900 TDD 1728 10 12 1152 GFSK 32 10 250 The basic structure of DECT is maintained in PWT The Physical Layer has been modified to suit the isochronous unlicensed band FCC rules and adaptation for the 1.25 MHz channel spacing. The Medium Access Layer has also been modified to adhere to the "etiquette rule The other parts of PWT, however are identical to DECT PWT Carriers Asynchronous data Synchronous voice 8  1.25 MHz frequency channels 1910 1920 1930 In summary, PWT is very similar to DECT, except at the physical and MAC layers where changes have been introduced for operation in the 1910  1930 MHz band rather than the 1880  1900 MHz band The modulation is n14 DQPSK rather than the GFSK used in DECT The FCC etiquette rules make the channel selection algorithm slightly altered in the Medium Access Layer The GAP Generic Access Profile where feature definitions and access to system features are defined were also slightly changed for operation in the US With 8 carriers available in the 1920 1930 MHz sub-band for PWT instead of the 10 available in DECT the large system peak traffic capacity maybe slightly Power However as the DECT capacity capability is so very large, this is not significant In conclusion, the PWT standard is an attractive option for wireless communication in the US especially for picocell and highly densed populated applications. Its capability in multi bearer is especially attractive for multimedia applications Its layered protocol structure allows easy migration to PWT for manufacturers with DECT products. DECT is also attractive because it has defined interworking with GSMIPCS1900 and provides a variety of defined data services with rates up to about 500 kb/s PCI PCI Personal Communications Interface\Interoperability Standard is an enhancement to the original CT2 standard which is designed for operation in the US unlicensed PCS band PCI is defined to operate in the sub-band 1920  1930 MHz The channel center frequencies for both the portable and fixed parts are defined by the following 1920.0  0.1 n MHz where n is an integer between 1 and 99 The first channel will be at 1920.10 MHz The last channel will be at 1929.90 MHz Frequency band 1920  1930 MHz US unlicensed PCS band Number of carriers 99  only 76 available for use because of FCC rules Carrier spacing lo0 MHz, 1910  30 MHz Peak transmit power 30 mW Carrier multiplex Frame length 2 ms Basic duplexing FDMA; 2 slots per frame TDD using 2 slots on same RF carrier Modulation 2-level FSK Gross bit rate 76 kbls Net channel rates 32 kb/s \(traffic\per slot 2 kbls controlhignaling\per slot The most noteworthy features of this standard are the digital transmission format and the use of time division duplexing TDD\With PCI speech is first digitized using a 32 kbls adaptive differential pulse code modulation ADPCM encoder. The time-compressed digitized speech and control data are modulated onto a carrier at a rate of 72 kb/s using Gaussian filtered FSK GFSK and are transmitted in 2-ms frames. Each frame includes one base-to-handset and one handset-to-base burst. This mode of duplexing \(TDD\has significant advantages no duplex filter is required in either the handset or the base station both transmission and reception antenna diversity can be used and the system is easily adapted to other frequency bands The PCI standard provides for 99 nominal carrier locations 960 


with 100 kHz spacing throughout the band Only about 76 of these are usable in practice due to restrictions in the FCC rules The maximum transmit power is 30 mW Two-level power control with a 16 dB step, is used to prevent the desensitization of base station receivers and as a by-product to contribute to improved frequency reuse PCI also supports the transmission of data up to 2.4 kb/s through the speech codec 4.8 kb/s under some circumstances\No other data services are supported except through the use of the signaling channel Standard Frequency Band MHz Duplexing Carrier spacing kHz Number of carriers Bearer channels/carrier Channel bit rate kb/s Modulation Speech Coding kb/s Frame duration msec Peak handset TX power mw 1920  1930 TDD 100 99 1 72 2 level  FSK 32 2 30 864  a68 TDD 100 40 1 72 GFSK 32 10 10 In summary, PCI is much like CT2 with operation in the 1920  1930 MHz band rather than the 864  868 MHz band With 10 MHz to work with the number of available channels for PCI is much enhanced over CT2 The modulation is exactly the same But with Part 15.D etiquette rule operation, paging, the channel selection algorithm and the call set-up procedures are slightly altered Nortel today is marketing PCI with the Companion brand name in the US with their PBX and wireless adjunct produces In conclusion the PCI standard is an attractive option for wireless communication and has been optimized with respect to cost. It is a low-cost and attractive standard to use in microcell in the mid-tier density for voice and low data rate in band\applications PACS Like PWT, the PACS standard uses TDMA and TDD. But each carrier only carries 4 duplex bearer channels rather than 12 in PWT Since PACS only has 4 full-duplex channels per carrier verses 12 full duplex channels per carrier for PWT each PACS base station does not have the same traffic carrying capacity as a PWT base station. The total number of traffic channels available in the band however, is about the same between PWT and PACS \(and also PCI The PACS unlicensed\standard has been developed from the PHS PBX Japanese standard largely by NEC and Panasonic PHS is designed for low tier public outdoor service, FWA, residential cordless and PBX applications The PACS as proposed in TIA is adapted to be used for US unlicensed PCS operation The differences with PHS are primarily in Layer 1 due to the constraints required by the spectrum etiquette rules and channel allocation required by the FCC Note that the unlicensed version of PACS standardized in the TR41.6 sub-committee is not the same as the licensed and unlicensed versions of PACS \(PACS UA and PACS UB standardized in the JTC These three versions are reported to be not interoperable The PHS allocation consists of 77 channels 300 kHz in carrier spacing in the band 1895  1918.1 MHz for Japan This 300 kHz carrier spacing fits well into the required channel spacing for United States isochronous PCS sub bands 1920  1930 MHz The asynchronous sub-band 1910  1920 MHz is not specified for use by PACS PACS utilize time division duplex and time division multiple access. Access to radio channels is performed in accordance to the FCC's described etiquette for operation in the unlicensed PCS frequency band 1920 MHz  1930 MHz PACS uses dynamic channel assignment The modulation used for PACS is n/4 DQPSK which is the same as PHS. The maximum transmit power per channel is 53 mW The frame duration is 5 ms Like the other protocols discussed, PACS and PHS uses 32 kb/s ADPCM speech coding Unlike DECT/PWT PACS provides dedicated control channels The following are some technical details of the PACS air interface  Frequency band 1920  1930 MHz US unlicensed PCS band Number of carriers 32 Peak transmit power 53 mWpe Carrier multiplex TDMA 4 full-duplex channels Frame length 5 ms Basic duplexing TDD using 2 slots on same RF carrier Channel bit rate 384 kbps Voice encoding 32 kbps ADPCM Radio accesdduplex TDMA  TDD Number of TDMA multiplexed circuits 4 when full rate CODEC is used Carrier frequency spacing 300 KHz 100 KHz interleaving Modulation 7d4 shifted DQPSK roll-off rate  0.5 


PACS protocol structure is divided into three protocol stages with easy adaptation from PHS In conclusion, the PACS standard is an attractive option for wireless communication in the US especially for microcell and medium density applications Its layered protocol structure allows easy migration to PACS for manufacturers with products in PHS The proximity of the frequency bands between Japan and the USA would permit manufacturers to Droduce handsets References l David Steer, "Wireless Operation in the Unlicensed PCS Band 1994 Third Annual International Conference On Universal Personal Communications pp 586  590 September 1994 capable of op&ation in either domain Standard Frequency Band MHz Duplexing Carrier spacing kHz Number of carriers Bearer channeldcarrier Channel bit rate \(kbls Modulation Speech Coding kb/s Frame duration msec Peak handset TX power mW  Jay Padgett Christoph Gunther and Takeshi Battori Overview of Wireless Personal Communications IEEE Corr PCI 1920  1930 TDD 100 99 1 72 2 level  FSK 32 2 30 Closing This paper has reviewed the three user premise wireless standards for US PCS unlicense band operation The etiquette rule" for operation in the PCS unlicense band was also briefly described PWT offers the highest density microcell operation 8 with option to upgrade to 16 carriers each carrier supporting 12 full-duplex channels\and with PACS and PCI placing below PWT in traffic carrying capacity Three existing working air-interface standards has been adopted from Europe and Japan for operation in the new US PCS unlicense band for fast market deployment Only extensive changes are necessary in the Physical Layer and slightly modification in the Medium Access Layer are needed to meet the etiquette rule The expense of further modification in the higher layers are carefully avoided in the standards committee This strategy is especially attractive and were supported by manufacturers that already have products for the existing protcols Acknowledgments iunications Maga PWT 1920  1930 TDD 1250 8 16 if 1910 30 12 1 152 576 kbaud/s d4 DQPSK 32 10 90 ine pp 28  41, January 1995 PACS 1920  1930 TDD 300 32 4 384 d4 DQPSK 32 5 53  Stewart Kuan Mobility Functionality in New Generation PABXs 1995 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Universal Personal Communication Record pp 260  262 November 1995  TIA Standards Committee TR41.6 SP-3446 Personal Communications Interface Interoperability Standard \(PCI Revision 1.1, June 1995  TIA Standards Committee TR41.6 SP-3400 Wireless Customer Premises Equipment Interoperability Standard WCPE\Revision J June 1995  TIA Standards Committee TR41.6 SP-3447 Personal Access Communications System Wireless User Premises Equipment PACS-WE Air Interface Standard The author would like to thank all the members in TIA TR41.6 and David Steer of Nortel whose work and feedback contributed to this article 


search can be started Provided the core structure is specific enough, there are only few at best only one embedding per molecule so that the list of embeddings is short While it is trivial to embed a single atom into a molecule embedding a core structure can be much more difficult In our implementation we rely on the following simple obser vation Embedding a core structure is the same as finding a common substructure of the molecule and the core that is as big as the core itself This leads to the idea to grow a sub structure into both the core and the molecule until it com pletely covers the core. That is we do a substructure search for the core and the molecule starting from an arbitrary atom of the core and requiring a support of 100 i.e both the core and the molecule must contain the substructure In addition, we can restrict the search to one embedding of a substructure into the core at all times since we know that it must he completely covered in the end For the molecule however we must consider all possible embeddings Note that the same mechanism of growing a substructure into two molecules can also be used for substructure tests as they are needed to suppress multiple reporting of the same fragment see above as well as reporting redundant frag ments fragments that are substructures of some other frag ment and have the same support as this fragment 2.7 Finding Contrast Structures Our approach to find frequent substructures can easily be extended to find contrasf sfrucfures that is substructures that are frequent in a predefined subset of the molecules and infrequent in the complement of this subset Finding con trast structures requires two parameters a minimum sup prt for the focus subset and a maximum support for the complement The search is carried out in exactly the same way as described above The only difference is that two support numbers are determined one for the focus subset and one for the complement Only the support in the focus subset is used to prune the search tree The support in the complement determines whether a frequent substructure is recorded or not thus filtering out those substructures that do not satisfy the requirements for a contrast structure 3 Experimental Results We applied the presented approach to a number of confi dential data sets with substantial success In order to be able to report results in more detail we used a well-known publicly available dataset from the National Cancer Insti tute the DTP AIDS Antiviral Screen dataset This screen utilized a soluble formazan assay to measure protection of human CEM cells from HIV-1 infection Full details were published in I I Compounds able to provide at least 50 protection to the CEM cells were retested Compounds that provided at least 50 protection on retest were listed as moderately active CM Compounds that reproducibly Atom C Carbon 0 Oxygen N Nitroeen CA CM and CI 325 100.0 36828 99.95 311 95.7 33029 89.64 276  84.9 29234 \(79.34 224  S Sulfur 11 143 44.0 I 10926 29.65   I1 I Se Selenium 11 6  1.9 1 132 0.36 Table I Some single-atom fragments occurring in molecules of the HIV database, together with their Occurrence frequencies provided 100 protection were listed as confirmed active CA\Compounds not meeting these criteria were listed as confirmed inactive CI Available online 8 are screening results and chemical structural data on compounds that are not covered by a confidentiality agreement Available are 41,316 compounds of which we used 37,171 Out of these a total of 325 belongs to class CA 877 are of class CM and the remaining 35,969 are of class CI NCI lists 75 known active compounds which are grouped into seven classes I Azido Pyrimidines 2 Natural Prod ucts or Antibiotics 3 Benzodiazepines, Thiazolobenzim idazoles and related Compounds 4 Pyrimidine Nucleo sides 5 Dyes and Polyanions 6 Heavy Metal Com pounds. and 7 Purine Nucleosides As described above, our molecular fragment mining al gorithm requires a seed fragment which may be empty For the HIV dataset an empty core results in numerous em beddings of trivial fragments such as single carbon atoms or small combinations of carbon atoms only However fragments of interest contain at least one non-carbon atom which enabled us to seed the algorithm using the remaining atoms The list of atoms can be obtained through various methods We simply started from an empty core restricted the fragment size to one atom, and ran our molecular frag ment miner. Parts of the resulting list of atoms together with their occurrence frequencies are listed in Table I Obviously due to space constraints we cannot report in detail about seeding the algorithm with each of these atoms In the following we therefore concentrate on a few exper iments to demonstrate how the proposed method picks out relevant fragments in some of these groups 3.1 Nitrogen based Fragments First we focus on compounds containing a nitrogen atom We used a minimum support of 15.0 for compounds of class CA and a maximum support of 0.1 for the comple ment\222 classes CM and CI 171 fragments were generated 3Thresholds were selected %p-down\224 i.e starting with large rellings that quickly resulted in no reponed fragmens the thresholds were subne quentially lowered until a small number of fragments was reponed 56

single bond  aromatic bond single bOnd  aromatic bDnd d CBO Figure 9 Two fragments extracted from a sei of steroids On the left, single and aromatic bonds were treated as different bond types. on the right they were treated as the same bond type 3.4 Treatment of Aromatic Bonds An important aspect of molecular fragment mining is the treatment of aromatic rings Since ammaticity is not clearly defined and can be modeled differently i.e explicit aro matic bonds vs alternating single and double bonds it is desirable to be able to take it into account throughout the mining process itself We achieve this by modeling aro matic bonds as either single or double bonds with a flag that indicates aromaticity This allows us to choose to ignore this flag during mining and hence to find fragments that contain either aromatic or single resp double bonds The following example illustrates why this is desirable Using a small set of steroid compounds we derived frag ments that occur in ail of them support=100%\using the standard algorithm Figure 9 left shows the correspond ing fragment Note how only two rings with an incomplete third ring are discovered of the four ring structure that is typical for steroids However if we model aromatic bonds as single+flag and allow the algorithm to ignore this flag the resulting fragment contains all four rings see Figure 9 right For some steroids this fourth ring consists of sin gle bonds while others have an aromatic ring at this posi tion However most chemists still regard this as the same 4 ring structure Such selective 223tolerance\224 against some mis matches can therefore make the presented algorithm more useful for real applications 4 Conclusions We presented an algorithm to find relevant molecular frag ments in large chemical structure databases The algorithm allows us to focus on fragments that help to discriminate be tween different classes of molecules The underlying search method, which is based on a depth first search with struc tural pruning makes it possible to find such fragments effi ciently without the need for frequent reembeddings of frag ment candidates, which is a known problem of previously reponed approaches We have shown how the proposed method finds relevant fragments using data from a well known HIV-screening compound database The extracted fragments successfully model several of the activity classes known for this dataset Future work will focus on making the presented approach more meaningful for the underlying application In partic ular finding fragments that match exactly is not of prime interest to chemists As demonstrate above some types of ring structures are considered functionally equivalent which should be taken into account by the search algorithm as well We are currently exploring ways to include such 223fuzziness\224 into the underlying search algorithm directly References I R Agrawal T Imielienski and A Swami.

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
