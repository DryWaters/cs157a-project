Validating Expert System Rule Confidences Using Data Mining of Myocardial Perfusion SPECT Databases CD Cooke, CA Santana TI Morris L DeBraal C Ordonez E Omiecinski NF Ezquerra EV Garcia Emory University  Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta, GA USA Abstract Our goal with this study was to use data mining techniques applied to imaging and textual patient databases to validate the confidences certainty factors of the heuristic rules in our previously described Expert System PERFEXTM 
A relational database combining textual and imaging information was generated from 655 patients who had undergone both stresshest myocardial perfusion SPECT and coronary angiography Initial data mining was concentrated on heuristic rules involving myocardial perfusion defects and the LAD vascular territory The results show the robustness of the expert system and furthermore show that data mining of large databases combining textual and imaging information can be used to validate and potentially improve the confidence levels associated with heuristic rules in expert systems 1 Introduction Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery is 
defined as the automated discovery of previously unknown nontrivial and potentially useful information from databases This information comes in the form of statements that describe the relationship between objects contained in the database, such that each statement is in some sense simpler than enumerating all the relationships between the individual instances of objects I For example in a database of patients, that includes locations of perfusion defects and measures of coronary stenoses each record represents the relationship between an individual patient and his clinical variables A statement such as patients with defects in the inferior wall often have 
a significant Right Coronary Artery stenosis based on the records of the database, conveys information that is implicit and more interesting than listing the perfusion defects and coronary stenoses of all patients This type of inference is called induction 2 In other words data mining infers statements that are supported by the database as opposed to statements that can be proved with respect to the database 3 Data mining is the process of generating high-level statements that have acceptable certainty and are also interesting from a database of facts 
1.1 Data mining Consider a database of patient records where each record is a combination of both textual information and extracted image data for a given patient Since the data mining algorithm only works with binary variables specifically only those binary variables that are true or I we must devise a mapping from the database information to binary data For example, the database field LAD stenosis can be converted into a binary variable by assigning a 1 if the stenosis is 50 and a 0 if 
it is 40 Each binary variable is referred to as an item An association rule is an implication of the form X Y X implies Y where X  Y are sets of items and X  Y have no items in common Each itemset or set of items has an associated measure of statistical significance called support The support for an itemset X or Y is defined as the percent of records that contain all of the items in the itemset 
In addition a rule has a measure of its strength called confidence which is really the conditional probability P\(y]X and is defined as the ratio support\(X U Y  support\(X The higher the confidence, the more certain you can be that the rule is valid The problem of mining association rules is to generate all rules that have support and confidence greater than some user specified minimum support and minimum confidence thresholds respectively This problem can be decomposed into the following sub problems generating all itemsets that have support above the user 
specified minimum called large or frequent itemsets and generating all the rules that satisfy the minimum confidence for each frequent itemset generated Discovering all frequent itemsets and their support is a nontrivial problem because the number of itemsets increases exponentially as support is lowered In addition, data mining is generally performed on databases that contain millions of records with few fields per record Our application differs in two ways 1 we have 0276-6547/00 10.00 0 2000 IEEE 785 Computers in Cardiology 2000;27:785-788 


combined both textual information and image information into one database and 2 our database contains hundreds of records with hundreds of fields per record This makes the process of finding all frequent itemsets and their support even more difficult As an example consider a database of 5 patient records where each of the fields has already been mapped into a binary variable as shown in Table 1 Table 1 Example database of 5 patient records for illustrating data mining techniques, where Ant  anterior wall perfusion defect Lat  lateral wall perfusion defect Inf  inferior wall perfusion defect LAD  550 LAD stenosis LC.X  450 LCX stenosis RCA  550 RCA stenosis If the minimum support were set to 40 then the resulting frequent itemsets would be If the minimum confidence is set to SO then the rule association Ant LAD would have a support of 60% \(from the table above, the support of Ant, LAD is 60 and the confidence would be 100 support  Ant LAD  support  Ant Some additional rule associations are shown below Lat a Ant I 40 I 50%\(40%/80 1.2 PERFEX We have previously described our development and validation of an expert system, PERFEX, for interpreting myocardial perfusion scans 4-61 PERFEX contains 253 heuristic rules that correlate the presence and location of perfusion defects on SPECT studies with coronary angiography cath demonstrated CAD and with expert visual interpretations Each rule within PERFEX was originally assigned a certainty factor based on the experience of several domain experts \(experts in the field of Nuclear Cardiology Certainty factors are a measure of a rules certainty they range from 1 absolutely certain there is no disease to 1 absolutely certain there is disease with the range from 0.2 to 0.2 indicating 223unknown\224 certainty or indeterminance When run against 655 patients with these assigned certainty factors PERFEX demonstrates a significantly lower sensitivity and higher specificity than visual interpretation for identifying the presence and location of CAD vs Cath, as shown in Table 2 Table 2 Sensitivities Sn and specificities Sp for detecting the presence and location of CAD for PERFEX and Visual interpretation verses Cath for 655 patients p e 0.05 2 Methods A database was generated from 655 patients who had previously undergone both stresdrest myocardial perfusion SPECT and coronary angiography The database consisted of 1 14 textual variables including results from the SPECT study and the coronary angiography from the cardiac databank plus 64 perfusion variables from the output of the CEqual program 32 from the stress 223blackout\224 data the results of comparing the patient\221s perfusion to a gender matched normal file and 32 from the reversibility data the results of comparing the normalized difference between stress and rest to a gender matched normal file The database information was then converted into a format where each database field became several binary variables as required by the data mining algorithm This conversion resulted in 476 binary variables for the textual fields and 64 binary variables for the imaging information 8 If these 540 fields had been used for the data mining algorithm there would have been a huge set of Note that not all associations make clinical sense ie  Lat Ant association rules found \(approximately 2540 Therefore 786 


three methods were used to reduce these possible associations First a field-filtering program was used to focus the associations on specific interesting database fields For the purpose of this paper we focused on 12 fields nine imaging fields condensed from the 32 stress blackout variables see figure 1 and three coronary angiography fields LAD LCX and RCA stenoses 250 Second, the association rules were limited to a 10 support and a 40 confidence Finally the association rules were limited to those with one antecedent and one consequent With these constraints the algorithm \(written in C\took less than 1 second to complete, on a Sun Ultra 10 workstation 28 If Apical then LAD Figure 1 Nine imaging fields used for the data mining 70 0.39 0.70 3 Results Visual Data Mining PERFEXvs Visual The data mining resulted in 181 association rules of which 7 involved the LAD and were part of the 253 heuristic rules within PERFEX These 7 rules are shown in Table 3 along with their original CF\222s from PERFEX The New CF\222s were calculated from the confidence using a linear equation with a 50 confidence set equal to a CF of 0 and a 100 confidence set equal to a CF of 1.0 The certainty of these nine heuristic rules in PERFEX were changed to the newly calculated CFOs and run against the same 655 patients When compared to the previous results there were no statistical differences found in detecting or localizing CAD as shown in Table 4 82 74 74 68 89 70 74 79 Table 3 Seven heuristic support Sup confidence derived from data mining certainty factors derived PERFEX CF Rule rules from PERFEX with Conf  certainty factors DM CF and the original from the domain experts Table 4 Sensitivities Sn and specificities Sp for detecting the presence and location of CAD for PERFEX vs Cath and PERFEX vs Visual interpretation Original values are from PERFEX using the original CF\222s derived from the domain experts; Data Mining values are from PERFEX using the CF\222s derived from the data mining p=NS 787

Recommends that requirements be added to allow connection of power supplies either through isolating transformers for ungrounded secondary or through GFCIs Recommends additional requirement for the oil reservoir of a hydraulic pump to not be more than 35 feet vertically below the tool to guard against loss of insulating value due to partial vacuum in hose Live Line Tools i This section contains requirements for tests and materials handling and storage of live line tools hot sticks Included are the following requirements Specific design testing values for fiberglass and wood hot sticks Visual inspection before use each day and removal from service if a defect or contamination affecting insulating value is found Comments 2 APPA recommends that in accordance with industry practice specific allowance should be made for wiping contaminated tools or refurbishing defective tools and returning them to service after successfully passing specified test EEI states that electric retesting of live line tools is not required unless there is reason to suspect a problem and believes that its position is consistent with the applicable IEEE and ASTM standards EEI proposes rewording paragraph j 2 which addresses the condition of tools and which provides that if contamination exists the tool surface be cleaned before use Also if any defect or contamination is found which adversely affect the insulating qualities or mechanical integrity the tool should be removed from service EEI proposes that the live line tools be removed from service every two years cleaned and/or repaired by qualified personnel and that repaired tools be electrically tested Materials Handlinn and Storage k This section is to be in accordance with 1910 Subpart N and includes the following provisions Specifies distances to energized lines in areas where storage is accessible to unqualified persons \(ten feet plus adder over 50 kV For qualified employees, material may not be stored in working space according to the National Electric Safety Code NESC Unqualified employees may not bring material closer than distances specified in this section, which are based on ten feet for voltages up to 50 kV Comments k APPA recommends that the entire section be deleted and that their attachment be included which is essentially the EEI/IBEW proposal OSHA's proposed distances for qualified employees apparently refers to Table 124-1 of the 1987 NESC which is based on phase to phase clearances APPA recommends that these clearances be on a phase to ground basis in accordance with section \(l of the Rules Tables R-6 and R-7 A2-7 1

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
