items Based on the proposed model our system can predict which items should be recommended to the prospective customers to realize the personalized service How to derive the association rules from large database and how to apply the derived rules to establishing a fuzzy inference model are illustrated by simple examples 1 Introduction Fuzzy set theory has been used in a wide variety of applications since Zadeh introduced it in 1965 161 Based on the fuzzy set theory we can define a membership function to characterize an element with a fuuy subset For a practical application whenever the input and output variables are kn.own we can use some training data to design a le base 
to model the behavior of the to-be-controlled system Also we can rely on some techniques to refine the fuzzy model to satisfy the system requirement 7-E In our daily life domain experts can handle many things without difticulty Why many people in concept well know to apply some techniques to solve problems How can we integrate the conceptual ideas into helping solve the complicated problems The Laplace transformation used in the engineering field provides such a good example The extension theory 5 investigates how to formalize the concepts to solve the incompatible or contradictory problems Define the name of a matter by N 
one of the characteristics of the maner by CR and the value about CR by V We use an ordered ternary R=\(N CR V as the fundamental element to describe a maher for transformation and call it a maher element SI The extension theory can be combined with the fuzzy theory to enhance the performance of a fuzzy model 191 Data mining means a process to extract useful information from a large database l-3 How to mining the association rules from a large database anracts intensive attention in recent years Given a database of sales transactions it is important to exploit some techniques to discover the implicit 
relationship inside the transactions In today's business data mining provides another way for a company to realize the personalized service to its customers Unlike conventional models that only concerned whether items appeared simultaneously in the transactions we propose a new model that also considers some important factors such as purchased quantity and total expenditure during the mining process Therefore this paper exploits the fuzzy inference method to propose a new model to derive an effective association rules 2 Mining the association rules from large database The prototypical application of ARM Association Rule Mining is market-basket analysis where the items represent products and the records represent point-of-sales data 
at large grocery stores or depamnent stores An example rule might be 90 of customers buying bread also buy milk The process of data mining can be divided into two steps 1 find all frequent item sets and 2 generate shong association rules from the frequent item sets I Two criteria are used to measure the frequent item sets Traditionally both minimum support and confidence are defined in advance to find the frequent item sets The support value from relating item A to item B is defined as follows Supporr\(A a B _tuples~confainingb~~h-A~nnd B 
Similarly the confidence value from item A to item B is defined as follows  mpla confolning both A and B It mplrs conalnlng A conjidmce\(A  E  Based on the defined support and confidence values we can find whether two or more items appear frequent enough in the transactions Different methods have been proposed to find the association NICS Apriori algorithm 4 finds frequent item sets by using the candidate generation. Apriori employs an iterative approach known as level-wise search where k-item sets are used to explore I sets A two-step process which 
consists of joining and pruning actions that look at how Lh is used to find L  is required The joining step is defined to find L  a set of candidate k-item sets generated by joining Li with itself In the pruning step all candidates C  having items no less than the minimum support are frequent by definition AprionTid is a refined version of the original Apriori algorithm 4 The feature of the AprioriTid is that the 0-7803-7293-X/O1/$t7.00 01 2001 IEEE 272 2001 IEEE lnternplional Fuzzy Systems Conferencc 


database is not used for counting support after the first pass Thus, much time can be saved The Boolean method is another approach to obtaining the association rules  In the Boolean algorithm two major steps are needed. First both logical OR and AND operations are used to compute the frequent item sets Second. logical AND and XOR operations are applied to deriving all interesting association rules As can be seen that the Apriori, AprioriTid, and Boolean algorithms can derive the association rules without difficulty The problem is how to modify the conventional models such that they can provide more valuable information for today\222s business 3 The proposed model Previous models generated the association rules by considering whether the interesting items exist simultaneously or not Most models did not consider the number of purchased quantity total expenditure or seasonal factor in a single transaction As we know in wholesale stores customers usually buy multiple pieces of the same item As a result, the purchased quantity should be carefully considered Take the transaction records in Table 1 for example It means that the first customer bought four item-A two item-B and two item-C The second customer bought three item-A one item8 and one item-C. Thus the relationship in the first transaction should be different from the second one. This is why in our model we try to investigate the purchased quantity of each item in establishing the association rules We apply the matter-element model discussed in extension theory to constructing our new model As we know each item is associated with the purchased price and quantity in the transaction record When considering from the aspect of quantity we can express the transaction in terms of matter-element model as follows For example, item-A in the first transaction in Table 1 can be expressed by The membership degree for item-A in the fuzzy subset M is determined by the membership functions defined in Fig 1 Similarly item8 in the first transaction can be expressed by It happens that two consecutive membership functions may include a given quantity and result in two different membership degrees To simplify the model we take the larger degree to be the membership degree for a given quantity From Table I the association rule from the first transaction can be derived as follows R  item  AB quantity pM A fls E Similarly, the association rule from the second transaction can he obtained as follows Having analyzed from the transaction records that when both item-A and itemB have been purchased customers may continue purchasing item-C We may derive the following fuzzy rules If item-A is FA and item-B is FE then itemC is FC  R=\(item name quantity, membership degree RA  item A quonriry pM A R item B,quantiry,ps\(B RA ifem-AB,quontiry,pM\(A B Note that FA FE and FC are fuzzy subsets defined for item-A item8 and item-C, respectively. Assume three labels small S medium M and large L are selected for hotb variables of item-A and itemB in our model We assign singleton values for FC  Depending on the distribution of the data different labels may be used in different cases Besides, the fuzzy rules may take the TSK or other types E in consequent parts The next step is to establish the fuzzy inference de base such that we can have an idea how many item-C should be recommended to prospective customers We use Table 1 and Fig 1 to illustrate the procedures From Fig 1 we have pM A  0.8 and ps\(B  0.4 for the fint transaction and pM A  0.6 and p,\(B  0.2 for the second transaction Thus the entry in the intersection of labels 223medium\224 and 223small\224 in the rule base should be given the value derived from the defuzzified method as follows 0.8x0.4 0.6x0.2   0.8x0.4+0.6x0.2 The rest of the enhies in Table 2 can be assigned in a similar way Fig 2 shows the framework of our model The procedures to derive our model can be summarized as follows I Use conventional method such as AprioriTid algorithm to obtain the large-item sets For example we can proceed from large I-itemset A to large 2-itemset AB and then to large 3-itemset ABC 2 Express the interesting items by matter-element models 3 Denote the interesting items in smaller large-item set Lk as the conditional part and the item joined to Lk to generate the larger L as the consequent part in the fuzzy rules Establish a fuzzy rule base from the derived association rules 4 Use the fuzzy inference model to infer the quantity of candidate item for the prospective customers 4 Simulation Results To illustrate how the proposed model works with the conventional methods we use 10,000 data from a large database including 143,114 transactions to run the simulations We first exploit the AprioriTid method to extract the association rules Assume the minimum support and confidence are 6 and 60 respectively Fig 3 is the designed interface for users to input the minimum suppolt and confidence Fig 4 shows the large 1-itemset From the transaction table there are 214 large item sets satisfying the requirement of minimum support and confidence. The large 2-itemset i.e two items appeared simultaneously in the same transaction is plotted in Fig 5 There are 73 large item sets passing the thresholds Based on the large 2-itemset we can derive 13 3-itemset satisfying the minimum support as shown in Fig 6 Since part of the generated 3-itemset did not pass the minimum confidence threshold only 7 association rules were derived from our system Fig 7 illustrates the final 7 association rules in our model Fig 8 plots the purchased quantities associated with the items in our database Note that the results demonstrated in Fig 3 to Fig 7 only consider whether an item or items appeared in the transactions or not 273 


The conventional methods did not consider from other aspects such as the purchased quantity for an item or the total expenditure in the store in a transaction We propose a new model to derive the fuzzy rule base from the final association rules By integrating the final association rules shown in Fig 7 the transaction records given in Fig 8 and the methods discussed in the third section we obtain the fuzzy rule base listed in Table 3 The purpose to establish such a fuzzy rule base is focused on providing personalized services to prospective customers. For example there are 73 large item sets in Fig 5 Pan of the 2-itemset joins another item to become the results given in Fig 7 By taking the 2-itemset as the two premise variables and the third item in the corresponding 3-itemset as the consequent variable in the fuzzy rules, we can apply our result in Table 3 to infening the suitable amount of quantity that can be recommended to the prospective customers to buy them By the way we can automatically forward any news or catalog closely related to the inferred item to the customers\222 electronic mails or wehsites to realize the personalized services and in turn to increase the company\222s profits This is why we emphasize that we dedicate to combine the proposed fuzzy model with the association rules to provide a better service to the prospective customers We further analyze the sales trend for each month. Fig 9 illustrates the number of large itemsets for each month under minimum support and confidence being 2 and 60 respectively The number of large itemsets is decreasing progressively at each month. However it is clear from Fig 9 that the total sales decline in the first half a year and gradually climb to the top in December From extracted information, we can promote some popular product itemsets to large I-itemset\222s customer and let larger I-itemsets to pass the minimum support threshold We can also put large 2-itemset into operation in the same manner to stimulate customer\222s purchasing interest Additionally managers can compare month\222s sales statistics in the past year via extracted data to promote some products for valuable customers 5 Conclusion In this paper we combined the fuzzy inference model with the association rules from the large database to fulfill the personalized service We created a new model that not only considered the association between interesting items but also took the factor of purchased quantity into account This proposed model is particularly suitable to the wholesale stores However the same technique can be easily applied to situations whenever different factors need to be considered The process to derive the large-item sets was illustrated by examples How to establish the fuzzy inference model was also discussed in detail. Finally, we explained how to use the fuzzy model to recommend the most suitable items to the prospective customers Our results verified that the proposed model is useful in different areas Acknowledgements This work was supponed by the National Science Council Taiwan R.O.C under Grant NSC89-2213-E-036-050 References l J Han and M Kamber Darn mining concepts and rechniques Morgan Kaufinann Publishers San Francisco CA 2001 2 S.Y Wur and Y H Leu 223An effective Boolean algorithm for mining rules in large database,\224 Proc 61h In Conf on Darnbase Sys:ens for Advanced Applications pp.179 186 1999 3 M.-S Chen J Han and P.S Yu 223Data mining an overview from a database perspective,\224 IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Dafa Engineering vol 8 no 6 pp.866-883, Dec. 1996 4 R Agrawal and R Srikant, \223Fast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases,\224 Proc 2fYk In Conf kfy Large Data Bases pp.478-499 Sept. 1994 SI W Cai 223The extension set and incompatible problem,\224 J of Scientific Exploration vol 1 pp.81-93 1983 6 L.A Zadeh 221\221Fuzzy sets,\224 Informarion and Control vol 8 pp.338-353 1965 7 K Nozaki H Ishibuchi and H Tanaka 223A simple but powerful heuristic method for generating fuzzy rules from numerical data,\224 Fuzzy Sets and Sysfems vol 86 pp.251-270 1997 8 M Sugeno and T Yasukawa 223A fuzzy-logic-based approach to qualitative modeling,\224 IEEE Trans Fuzzy Systems vol 1 no I pp.7-31 1993 9 Y.-P Huang and H.-J Chen 223Using the transformed data to construct an extension-based fuzzy inference model,\224 in Proc 9:h IEEE In Con on Fuzzy Sysrems San Antonio TX USA pp.823-828, May 2000 Table 1 Asimple transaction table Table 2 The fuzz rule base item-A Table 3 A fuzzy rule base derived from our association rules Each entw revresents the auantitv of item-C to he   recommended to customers Fig 1 The membership functions for the variable 223quantity.\224 274

too much time to get the execution results for the test databases In Figure 4 the number of transactions in the test databases is set from lO0K to 500K and the minimum support is 0.75 From Figure 4 we can see that both the execution time of HMFS and DHP increases when the number of transactions increases However the execution time of the DHP algorithm is near linear to the size of test databases The HMFS method is not so sensitive to the size of a database compared to the DHP algorithm Therefore our HMFS method performs much better when the database size is larger IWK XQK 3WK WOK SWK IWX iooY WOK IWX raor  I D.hCSE Drllv lur a TlO14 b T1.514 iuirs 4-0 I la  224 k_ we   Ll1*Da.sr c T2014 d T2016 Figure 4 The execution time of the HMFS method and the DHP algorithm on the test databases with various database sizes Minimum Support  0.75 5 Conclusions In this paper we have proposed an efficient hash-based method HMFS for discovering the maximal frequent itemsets The method combines the advantages of the DHP and the Pincer-Search algorithms The combination leads to two advantages First the HMFS method in general can reduce the number of database scans Second the HMFS method can filter infrequent itemsets and use the filtered itemsets to find the maximal frequent itemsets faster In addition an efficient mechanism to construct the maximal frequent candidate itemsets is provided To evaluate the performance of our method we have implemented the proposed method along with the DHP and the Pincer-Search algorithms on a Pentium I11 800 MHz PC The experiments were conducted on various benchmark databases The experimental results show that our method has better performance than the DHP and the Pincer-Search algorithms for most of test cases In particular our method has significant improvement over the DHP and the Pincer-Search algorithms when the size of a database is large and the length of the longest itemset is relatively long References I A Savasere E Omiecinski and S Navathe 223An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases\224 In Proceedings oj\2242lst VLDB pp 432-444 1995 2 D Lin and Z M Kedem 223Pincer-Search A New Algorithm for Discovering the Maximum Frequent Set\224 In Proceedings of VI Intl Conference on Extending Database Technology 1998 3 Eui-Hong Han George Karypis and Vipin Kumar 223Scalable Parallel Data Mining for Association Rules\224 IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol 12 No 3 MAYlJUNE 2000 4 H Toivonen 223Sampling Large Databases for Association Rules\224 VLDB pp 134-145 1996 5 IBM Quest Data Mining Project 223Quest Synthetic Data Generation Code\224 223http\224//www almaden ibm codcslquestlsyndata html\224 1996  J S Park M S Chen and P S Yu 223An Effective Hash Based Algorithm for Mining Association Rules\224 Proceedings of the ACMSIGMOD pp 175-186 1995 7 M Houtjma and A Swami 223Set-Oriented Mining of Association Rules in Relational Databases,\224 11th Int\222l Conference on Data Engineer 1995 8 M J Zak.i S Parthasarathy M Ogihara and W Li 223New Algorithms for Fast Discovery of Association Rules\224 3rd Int\222l Corference oi2 Knowledge Discovery 8i Data Mining KDD Newport CA August 1997 9 Mohammed J Zaki 223Scalable Algorithm for Association Mining\224 IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol 12, No 3 MAY/JUNE 2000 IO M S Chen J Han and P S Yu 223Data Mining An Overview froin a Database Perspective\224 IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol 8 No 6 December 1996 l I M S Chen J S Park and P S Yu 223Efficient Data Mining for Path Traversal Patterns\224 lEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol IO No 2 1998 pp 209-220 12 R Agrawal T Imilienski and A Swami 223Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases\224 In Proceedings of the ACM SlGMOD Intl Conference on Management of Data pp 207-216 May 1993 13 R Agrawal and R Srikant 223Fast Algorithm for Mining Association F.ules in Large Databases\224 In Proceedings of 1994 Int\222l Conference on VLDB pp 487-499 Santiago Chile Sep 1994 I41 R Agrawal H Mannila R Srikant H Toivonen and A lnkeri Verkamo 223Fast Discovery of Association Rules,\224 Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining U Fayyad and et al eds pp 307-328 Menlo Park Calif AAA1 Press 1996 I51 R Agrawal and J Shafer 221\221Parallel Mining of Association Rules,\224 IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol 8 No 6 pp 962-969, Dec 1996 16 R J Bayardo Jr 223Efficiently Mining Long Patterns from Databases\224 In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data pp 85-93 Seattle Washington June 1998 I71 S Brin R Motwani J D Ullman and S Tsur 223Dynamic Itemset Counting and Implication Rules for Market Basket Data\224 1997 ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data pp 255-264 1997 516
