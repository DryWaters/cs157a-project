in Table 1 have been developed arid they provide us informative URLs by slearch queries with boolean expressions 13 51 However without rich background knowledge about the web space, it is too hard to judge whether interest ing documents really include the combination of a few keywords especially in the cabe that those keywords may have different meanings in other domains There fore in order to describe adequate queries it is irnpor tant to grasp the suitable cornbination or association of keywords which exist in the database At present we 
have been developing the search en gine with applying techniques of text data rniriing to tlie web resource discoverv[7 The algorithms of data mining or KDD Knowledge Discovery in Databases 4 1060-3425198 10.00 0 1998 IEEE Proc 31st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 2 61 derive some constraints rules or patterns in var ious types of databases Our developing search engine provides association rule:j by the techniques of text data mining and it is possible to modify initial submitted query with boolean cxpressions including a few key

documents For example when we have to check a few web documents it is very useful to get the relation between the access page arid other popular web1 pages Actually me often make the list of cool web pages based on the voting of internet users Then we analyze web space as a typical structure of loosely connected hyper graph in Figure 1 and we try to evaluate the features of the interesting web pages by following two types of hyper links http www.kuamp kyot;o-u.ac jp/labs/infocom/mondou index-e  html 275

4 4.1 Our Mondou web search engine with mining algorithm Structure of M[ondou Mondou system consists of the following three  main modules agent database query server which are shown in Figure 4 CGI r--J--l I I i I Database I Figure 4 The structure of Mondou system The first module is often called as the robot program spider or uyent[9 and this prograni collects web pages in the internet and store them into the text database In addition to the norniall function of the robot our intelligent agent parses collected documents by sev eral methods including natural language processing[lO for Japanese documents Moreover in order to collect more interesting documents our agent often visits to special URLs as interesting web pages if they are re ferred many times from other web pages The detabuse stores data not only about keywords but also the number of links from other URLs U'e have to prepare the several tables for several different attributes keywords UR.I,s hyper links http servers stop words IP addresses and coiitrol/rriariagerrieIit data for Mondou system The q.uer.y ser-uer is the search program which is ex ecuted by CGI Common Gate Interface and it pro vides search results and mining association rules to the users The mining algorithm is described in the previ ous subsection 3.2 The input web page of hlondou system is shown in Figure 6 it is possible to eriter any suitable corribi nation of search keyword!j using AND NOT boolean expressions in each empty box For examle when he/she submitted initial keyword knowkdge Mondou provbded him/her several rules as associative keywords engineering systems knowl edge in Japanese acquisition and so on which is shown in Figure 7 Consequently even by applying our proposed algorithm without taxonomies concep tual trees or ontologies he/she can grasp the associ ation or relation among important keywords it1 those interesting web pages 4.2 Extension of Mondou in heteroge neous dat ab<ases At present we try to extend the implementation of Mondou as a full t.ext search system and also to derive much more effective rules from heterogeneous databases Firstly we use full t,ext retrieval systems as basic database systems in Figure 5 T$.'e conibine the pro grams of Mondou system arid the interface program which is the agents for t tie full text database and try to provide typical communication interface using KQnlL language Secondly we implement the CGI programs and the mining program to derive different set of association rules from heterogeneous databases Using the search res.ults and the association rules from heterogeneous dat,abases improved Mondou sys tem can provide more effective keywords to users In Figure 9 after selecting of electrical news "fj.rec.autos as one of databases we enter the keyword oil in Japanese\into improved hloridou system 111 the re sults improved nloiidoii system provide us mo:re inter estirig associative keywords which are tightly related to the domain of autos 4.3 Evaluation of Mondou lye are operating bIontlou system in the internet and we examine the quality of niariy search queries pat terns of combination of keywords arid other features Table 7 shows typical examples of derived kevmords the nurnber of URLs and associative keywords derived by mining algorithm By using associative keywords we can easily get in teresting combination of keywords that can be treated as several meanings in web documents It is helpful for many users to grasp the structure of web documents by associative keywords From February to October in 1996 Mondou executed 931,537 queries submitted from the users Surprisingly there are only 20,734 queries 2.23 with NOT expres sion it is too difficult for most of users to describe the querv with adequate NOT keywords 279

6 Conclusions We presented MAFIA an algorithm for finding maximal frequent itemsets Our experimental results demonstrate that MAFIA consistently outperforms Depthproject by a factor of three to five on average The breakdown of the algorithmic components showed parent-equivalence pruning and dynamic reordering were quite beneficial in reducing the search space while relative compressiodprojection of the vertical bitmaps dramatically cuts the cost of counting supports of itemsets and increases the vertical scalability of MAFIA Acknowledgements We thank Ramesh Agarwal and Charu Aggarwal for discussing Depthproject and giving us advise on its implementation We also thank Jayant R Haritsa for his insightful comments on the MAFIA algorithm and Jiawei Han for providing us the executable of the FP-Tree algorithm This research was partly supported by an IBM Faculty Development Award and by a grant from Microsoft Research References I R Agarwal C Aggarwal and V V V Prasad A Tree Projection Algorithm for Generation of Frequent Itemsets Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing special issue on high performance data mining to appear 2000 2 R Agrawal T Imielinski and R Srikant Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases SIGMOD May 1993  R Agrawal R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc of the 20th Int Conference on Very Large Databases Santiago Chile, Sept 1994  R Agrawal H Mannila R Srikant H Toivonen and A 1 Verkamo Fast Discovery of Association Rules Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Chapter 12 AAAVMIT Press 1995 5 C C Aggarwal P S Yu Mining Large Itemsets for Association Rules Data Engineering Bulletin 21 1 23-31 1 998 6 C C Aggarwal P S Yu Online Generation of Association Rules.
