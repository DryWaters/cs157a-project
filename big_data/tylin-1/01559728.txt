While r ecent events have refocused human space flight with the goal of sending humans to Mars, the effort to synthe size a new human space flight architecture has been ongoing for the past five years.  With 
a beginning as NASA’s “Space Transportation Architecture Study” \(STAS final Orbital Space Plane OSP\Program, the goals of human space flight have been evolving  The fast pace of the program required a system where evolving mission needs and current design detail could be reconciled in real time.  Human operations and mission requirements had to be the driving force behind the system design.  A systems engineering tool was needed to tie the requirements to the operations, functions, and design  
The OSP Systems Engineering team methodology was based on a modified C4ISR “system of systems engineering framework.  Th is framework places equal emphasis on operations, functi onality, and technology, in contrast to a more classical systems engineering approach which emphasizes system functions and hardware based on constraints.  This was coupled with architectures based on modular functionality rather th an point designs.  When the customer significantly ch anged the architecture 
requirements, the design re sponded by variations in functional allocation and performance.  These changes in the architecture may or may not have impacted the design of hardware elements.  However in most cases, the operations of the architecture did not change. By designing the architecture to be responsive to the operational needs, the hardware elements were robust and were only minimally impacted by changes in requirements  
The tool selected to tie this methodology together was a systems engineering database, CORE TM by ViTech Corporation, which allows for definition of system engineering elements by the user. Orbital defined, modified and enforced a C4ISR systems engineering framework available within the tool.  Operational and functional models were developed and tied to architecture requirements. The human operations and functions that an element had to perform were a 
ssociated within the database Requirements were derived primarily in consideration of functions and operations and then allocated to hardware and human elements. When customer mission requirements changed, a quick assessment of design impact could be performed.  When the allocated functionality of an element changed or its operational us e changed, the requirements associated with those aspects moved with the function or 
operation  Neither a systems engineering methodology nor a tool alone can succeed.  The right t ool needs to be present to enforce a consistent methodology.  This methodology and implementation presented is a novel approach to supporting evolving large-scale architect ures with a requirements management system and top level system performance analysis tool

This was primarily driven by the need for the U.S. to provide crew rescue capability for the International Space Station \(ISS\This forced a situation where mi ssion needs and system design were evolving in tandem.  It was necessary to provide consistency between the mission needs and design while allowing the mission needs to evolve  This objective was approached in a two-fold manner. The first challenge was to develop a methodology where system operations as well as mission requirements drive system design.  The second challenge was to implement the methodology in a systems engineering tool which tied together requirements management, functional modeling and operations modeling 2  O RBITAL S PACE P LANE P ROGRAM O VERVIEW  The OSP program was managed by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and was th e culmination of a six year effort to advance U.S. human spaceflight capability.  At its inception, the program was known as the Space Transportation Architecture Study \(STAS\Through several STAS phases, the re quirements evolved and were refined as both government and contractor communities studied the various technical challenges.  The scope of the effort ranged from space plat form servicing to human transportation to the Interna tional Space Station \(ISS logistics operations.  The goals of the program were defined by sets of Design Reference Missions \(DRMs\ch outlined the requirements for various architecture missions  In 2000, STAS evolved into the Space Launch Initiative SLI\to refine preliminary architecture concepts and to define key technologies that would be necessary to bring the next generation human spaceflight system to fruition At this point, it was envisioned that a reusable launch system would transport both humans and cargo, as well as perform servicing and other logistics operations in Low Earth Orbit \(LEO During the SLI program, it became clear that separation of crew and cargo was essential to th e safety of the crew and to reduction of cargo transportation costs In 2003 the goal of the program was refocused to only support the crew transfer and rescue needs of the ISS and the program was later renamed Orbital Space Plane \(OSP The reusable launch portion of the architecture was dropped, and OSP was slated to launch aboard an expendable launch vehicle.  During this phase, the importance of human safety was driven home by the Columbia accident and a hi ghly reliable abort system became imperative to the program In 2004, the OSP program was cancelled in favor of the presidential directive to design a Crew Exploration Vehicle CEV\ cha llenges the focused approach of the final OSP and promotes a “spiral” development that incrementally enhances capability until the goal of a human mission to Mars is realized The nature of the OSP program and its precursors demanded a robust systems engineering process and implementation that could keep up with the evolution of the requirements and the variations in programmatics.  The future CEV program will build upon knowledge gained during the STAS, SLI, and OSP programs 3  OSP  A RCHITECTURE O VERVIEW  The OSP Architecture evolved over the course of several years.  During the SLI and early OSP period, Orbital’s architecture included a space plane known as the Blended Lifting Body \(BLB\gure 1 below shows the BLB during launch.  This vehicle served as the crew transport and rescue vehicle for the ISS and had an integrated launch abort system Figure 1 OSP on a Delta IV Launch Vehicle 


 3 The BLB variant of the OSP vehicle was launched on an expendable launch vehicle \(ELV\nto an ISS transfer orbit From there, it was capable of performing phasing operations and proximity opera tions, as well as autonomous docking with ISS.  Upon completion of its mission, the BLB could de-orbit under its own power and perform a runway landing.  In the event of an emergency at ISS, the BLB served as a Crew Rescue Vehicle \(CRV supporting injured or ill crew members during de-orbit and landing As the program progressed, Orbital took on the role of ISS integration.  During this time a mating adapter \(MA\for the OSP vehicle to ISS was defined.  The need for and definition of the ISSMA was a direct result and use of the systems engineering process developed for the OSP program.  The modeling process that is described in this paper drove out the need for the ISSMA While design of the BLB was an interesting and challenging issue, it was the simpler part of the systems engineering process.  The OSP system had to be integrated with many existing systems.  These included, but were not limited to multiple ELV launch vehicles, the Air Force range, existing NASA processing facilities, and current and future communications networks.  A sample mission is outlined in Figure 2 A typical mission would begin at the bottom of the figure as the OSP vehicle rolls out from its processing facility.  Since the requirement was to launch on multiple launch vehicles the OSP vehicle could move to either the Delta or Atlas launch pads.  Continuing clockwise, after launch the OSP vehicle would maintain comm unication with both space and ground assets using direct and indirect links.  In the event of an aborted launch, the OSP vehicle could return to earth using emergency systems.  After nominal flight operations and re-entry, the OSP vehicle would return to its processing facility to be readied for its next mission The number of external interf aces to the OSP system drove the need for a rigorous and structured approach to meeting the mission needs while interface definition was still evolving.  The problem defined involved a “System of Systems” modeling approach 


 4 Figure 2 OSP Mission Overview As the OSP program evolved, the mission requirements evolved as well.  The evolu tion went beyond a refinement of existing requirements to the point of brand new requirements which drove the design of the entire system. In response to the new requirements, the OSP architecture changed to a capsule based OSP vehicle with an expendable launch abort system.  The systems engineering process allowed for a smooth change in the design process with minimal impacts to the operational and functional model of the system 4  S YSTEMS E NGINEERING P ROCESS  System of Systems The OSP system was driven by the external in terfaces to the program.  When these interfaces are complex and static the problem is difficult.  With complex dynamic interfaces the problem becomes even more difficult, and an operational framework becomes a crucial aspect of the design Traditional design approaches of less complex systems might be able to simply defi ne external interfaces and use them as design constraints.  However, the OSP system had to integrate with several large and operationally complex systems.  System interfaces changed throughout each mission and the entire lifetime of the OSP system Integrating the OSP operations into these systems with minimal disruption was essential.  The OSP mission operations also ran in parallel to ground processing due to the multiple, reusable airframes, adding further complexity.  The inte rfaces to the OSP system are shown in Figure 3 below.  This dynamic definition of interfaces drives the process to a “system of systems” view The challenge was to understand the operations of existing systems so that the OSP system would integrate and support continuing operations While there were many systems with which the OSP system interfaced, the primary systems that drove the OSP system were the ISS, the ELV, and human integration.  Human integration can be defined as interfacing with a human system.  In particular, the sp acecraft crew was defined as an external system.  The comple xity and dynamic nature of these particular interfaces drove almost every aspect of the system design.  As the operati ons of each external system varied, the OSP system operations and capabilities had to respond in kind.  Orbital chose to model the OSP vehicle interface dynamics using a states & modes approach.  A state was defined as a unique set of boundary conditions within which certain modes of functionality were required The complexity of operations modeling demanded a rigorous framework in which the systems engineering process could reside.  The framework would need to take into account external and internal operations, the functionality needed to perform various missions, and would have to respond to dy namic and volatile system requirements   0 OSP System 1 Spacecraft 2 Launch Vehicle 3 ISS Mating Adapter 4 Ground Segment

This framework defines the three views presented in Figure 4 of an architecture and their interrelationships:  Operational View, System View, and Technical Standards View  Figure 4 C4ISR Architecture Framework Views The Operational View is a description of the operational activities, operational elements, and information exchange within the architectur e.  The System View is a functional description of the architecture which defines the system elements and resources.  Th e Technical Standards View provides standards and guidelines for the system capabilities as well as addresses new technology development.  The three interre lated views are necessary to fully describe a “System of Systems C4ISR Systems Engineering Process Based on the C4ISR framework, a systems engineering process was established for the OSP program that allowed the system operations as well as the mission requirements to drive the system design.  The system operations were identified in terms of how the OSP system would be used and how it interfaced/integrated into the existing Human Space Flight Program.  The main emphasis was placed on the human interactions. The functionality of the system was then primarily driven by the identified operations.  How the system was being used defined the functions of the physical hardware elements.  Technologies and technology development influenced the system operations and functionality One of the unique challenges for the development was modeling the man-machine interf ace.  As presented earlier the OSP spacecraft crew were not in fact considered a part of the system.  They were the operators of one segment of the system.  Both human rating guidelines as well as human integration standards had to be considered.  Modeling the crew as an interface to the system allowed the dynamic operational aspects of human operations to be captured as a part of system operations 5  I MPLEMENTATION  This section describes the implementation of the C4ISR methodology in a systems engineering tool in order to tie together requirements management with operational modeling, functional modeling, and technologies CORE Overview The tool selected to tie this methodology together was a systems engineering database, CORE TM by Vitech Corporation.  The tool served as an integral part of the systems engineering process The C4ISR CORE methodology was developed for the OSP program to support specific products and viewpoints necessary to support the systems engineering process.  The products included Design Capture and Traceability Specification Generation, Operations and Simulation Analysis, and Technology Integration.  Figure 5 \(next page depicts the overall use of the CORE database.  The originating requirements, which included mission requirements, design requirements, environmental conditions, as well as guidelines and standards, served as inputs to the database.  These inputs captured the customers objectives.  The database was th en used to model the system through different views; the physical elements, a functional view, an operational view, an interface view, and a verification view.  The models were then used to generate outputs such as design documentation and to make system assessments C4ISR Schema Details A modified C4ISR schema was developed for this application, which allowed for the traditional functional views as well as the operational views of the system to be captured within the database.  Using the C4ISR framework as a guideline, an interpretation of the database elements was established in order to develop a schema which would allow for a “systems of syst ems” engineering approach The classes and relationships necessary to capture this information were defined to support this specific CORE application for the OSP program as shown in Figure 6.  The classes and relationships were primarily organized into three main categories consistent with the C4ISR framework System/Component Classes, Operational Classes, and 


 6 Derived Requirements Classes.  The System/Component Classes defined the physical hardware elements of the system, the physical interfaces of the system, and the functions performed by the physical 


 7 Figure 5 CORE Database Overview hardware elements.  The Operational Classes defined the operational elements of the system, the operational interfaces, and the operational activities including human interaction.  The Derived Requirements Classes defined the derived requirements based on th e originating requirements These derived requirements were then tied directly to the functional and operational models through either performance indices or constr aints.  Performance indices either indicated how well a function or an operational activity needed to be perfo rmed.  Constraints either constrained the physical hardware elements or operational elements Figure 6 CORE Element Classes CORE Models Using the previously discussed systems engineering process and CORE schema, the OSP system was defined and modeled within the CORE database.  This included the development and integration of an operational model system model, and technologies, as well as requirements management Operational Models Given the mission goal to support the crew transfer and rescue needs of ISS, heavy emphasis was placed on operations.  During the early phases of the program, the operational activities, both f light and ground, that the system needed to perform in order to meet the mission objectives were identified. These high-level operational activities were then further decomposed and addressed at a lower level.  For example, th e approach that was taken to further identify flight operations was to look closely at the operations the spacecraft would need to perform.  This was accomplished by identifying th e Spacecraft State & Mode along with the Transition Diagrams \(See Figure 7 and Figure 8 next page  Operational Classes  System / Component Classes  Derived Requirement Classes  Link  Fu nction  Compon ent System  Perf.

 8 Figure 7 Spacecraft State Transition Diagram The Spacecraft State Transition diagram depicts the unique states that exist, based on unique configurations and/or unique boundary conditions. Thes e states and transition activities were in essence the operational activities that needed to be performed by the system. Referring back to Figure 1, you can see a cartoon representation of the mission that parallels the states presented here.  Starting at the bottom of Figure 7, the spacecraft is in the “S/C Integrated LV State”.  This state exists during un-crewed joint operations with the launch vehicle, before the vehicle is on the pad. Once the joint stack is integrated to the pad the spacecraft moves to a new state.  The change in boundary conditions, specifically the addition of the pad as an interface source, forces a st ate change for the spacecraft Note that while a nominal mission would proceed clockwise through the state transition diagram opportunities exist to step back through the flow if conditions require.  The arrows indicate the only ways by which the spacecraft can change state.  Addition of crew members is a major state cha nge to the spacecraft.  Recall that the crew is modeled as an external interface to the system.  Therefore, with th e addition of crew, a major external interface is exercise d.  The conditions indicated along the state transition arrows dictate events that occur and define state transitions.  Of interest in the center of the state transition diagram is th e “S/C Crew Escape State This is the only state that is not part of a nominal mission During spacecraft operations, in itiation of the crew escape system creates a unique confi guration of the spacecraft, and therefore presents a new sp acecraft state.  Mission abort does not necessarily require crew escape, and may follow the nominal states, though at an expedited pace While states were defined by changes in boundary conditions of the spacecraft, modes are defined by a grouping of the functionality of the spacecraft. The operational modes within the “ISS Operations State” \(refer back to Figure 7\presente d in Figure 8.  Each mode within a state represents a set of functions that are enabled while further implying that certain functions are disabled 


 9 For instance, while in the “ISS Rendezvous Mode”, the function of actuating docking mechanisms might be disabled, and the firing of RCS thruster enabled. However in the “ISS Dock Mode”, the firing of RCS thrusters is inhibited, while docking actuation is available. On the left side of Figure 8 are the mode s from which entrance to the state is allowed.  Note that si nce there is more than one state from which you can enter the ISS Operations State”, the entrance modes called out may not all be in the same state Similarly, the exit modes on the right hand side of the diagram lead to modes in different states The spacecraft states and tran sition activities were then modeled as operational flows in CORE as shown in Figure 9 \(next page\e operational activities and their logical sequence are consistent with the Spacecraft State Transition Diagram shown above in Figure 7.  The operational model also identified the operational elements, which are tied to the physical hardware elements of the system that perform the operational activities Figure 8 Spacecraft Operational Modes  ISS Rendezvous Mode ISS Proximity Operations Mode ISS Dock Mode State Entrance State Exit S/C ISS Operations State From: Orbit Maneuver Mode To: Orbit Maneuver Mode From: ISS Checkout Mode To: ISS Checkout Mode ISS Undock Mode ISS Safe Haven Mode ISS Emergency Departure Mode From: S/C Powered Up Mode To: S/C Powered Up Mode 


 10 Figure 9 Spacecraft Operational Flow Functional Models After addressing the operational activities that the OSP system needed to perform, the functional models of the OSP system were developed consistent with the system engineering process discussed above.  The first step was to identify the physical hardware elements of the OSP system as prescribed by NASA.  The physical hardware elements of the OSP system were captured in CORE through component decomposition and represented as the product breakdown structure shown in Figure 10  Figure 10 Product Breakdown Structure of OSP System The OSP system functional models were developed by identifying the system functions based on the mission goals and operations that the system needed to perform.  These functions were then allocated to the prescribed physical hardware elements of the sy stem. As requirements and the system architecture evolved, the system functionality was re-allocated to different physi cal hardware elements.  In addition, the functional models also captured the physical interfaces between the OSP system, both internally and externally Interface Definition The CORE database also modeled and captured the interface complexity th at existed for the OSP system.  In the database a functional interface was represented as a collection of links that existed between physical hardware elements and an operational interface was represented as a collection of need-lines that existed between operational elements.  The links/need-lines were further defined by either  performance indices or constraints Internal and external functi onal interfaces were modeled within the CORE database by looking at different layers of the system physical hierarchy For example the interfaces between the OSP system and external systems were modeled as shown below in Figure 11, which depicts the interfaces that exist between the ISS Mating Adapter and ISS.

Therefore the OSP system had to meet the mission objectives using only existing technologies.  These existing technologies were introduced into the CORE modeling database as requirement constraints on the OSP system Requirements Management Requirements management was performed within the CORE database to track and perform requirements flowdown as well as tie the requirements together with the operational models, functional models, and technologies Requirements told either how well the system needed to perform, set constraints on the system, or defined the interfaces.  In the CORE database, all requirements appeared as either performance indices or constraints The customer objectives were introduced into the CORE database as originating requirements.  These originating requirements included mission requirements, design requirements, environmental conditions, guidelines, and standards.  Originating requi rements were then traced to OSP System Level requirements.  The OSP System Level requirements defined the performance indices and constraints at the system leve l.  These performance indices and constraints were then flowed down and decomposed into lower level performance i ndices and constraints at the segment level, element level, and component level.  This supported the development of the system and segment performance specifications and requirements traceability matrix All of the requirements captured in CORE were directly tied to either the operational model, functional model, or technologies.  If the requirement was a performance requirement, it was tied to either the operational or functional model through a performance index.  The performance index indicated how well the function or operation needed to be accomplished. The function or operation in turn was tied back to the hardware elements of the OSP system.  For example, the requirement for two days of contingency operations by the spacecraft while not mated to ISS was represented as a performance index exhibited by the “Spacecraft On-O rbit Operations” activity previously shown in Figure 9. The “Sp acecraft On-Orbit Operations activity was in turn performed by the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement set a constraint on the system, it was depicted as a constraint on either an operational element or hardware element in CORE.  For example, the requirement that the spacecraft shall have an operational service life of thirty years was captured in CORE as a constraint on the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement defined an interface, it appeared as either a performance index or constraint on a link.  For example, the requirement that the mechani cal interface between the ISS Mating Adapter and Spacecraft shall be the Low Impact Docking System \(LIDS constraint that was placed on 


 12 the “Mating Adapter to Sp acecraft Docking/Attachment Mechanism\(s\k previously identified in Figure 12 One of the challenges for the requirements management process was capturing the manmachine interfaces.  This specific challenge was to develop and implement a methodology that allowed operational requirements to drive the physical hardware design.  In CORE, this was accomplished by allowing performance indices tied to the operational model to decompose into performance indices related to the operational model as well as the functional model 6  C ONCLUSION  A robust systems engineering process is required for a large scale program with many interfaces.  The processes and implementation presented in this paper are ideal when faced with a rapidly changing requirements environment and dynamic interfaces.   Traditional acquisition of systems revolves around a rigid set of design-to requirements.   As recent history has shown, opera tionally based acquisition is on the rise.  This means that requirements are more likely to be in flux further into the program The C4ISR methodology and implementation presented in this paper provide a robust system engineering process for a large scale program with many interfaces.  In particular, the dynamic interfaces and the integration of human interfaces were handled through the development of segment states and modes.  The state transitions were driven by system operations.  This operations based systems engineering is necessary to understand large, complex systems The process was implemented using the CORE systems engineering tool.  A flexible tool such as CORE was required to build the custom schema required for this unique program.  The capability to rigorously define the dynamic interfaces as well as decompose those interfaces was required to capture the dynamics of operationally driven systems.  Functional and physical models responded to these operations. This implementation in CORE allowed for a “Systems of Systems” view to be modeled within the same database as requirements management The demise of the OSP and precursor programs cut short the full implementation of this process.  Given time, states modes, and then operational and functional models would have been built for all segments of the system.  In addition the end to end traceability from operational requirements to component design requirements would have provided a robust platform for system verification While human spaceflight is a unique problem, the issue of systems of systems” integration is present in many fields When this is coupled with human integration, the need for an operations approach is multiplied.  Determining how to operate a system after it is functionally and physically designed results in delays and cost escalation.  An approach that takes into account human interaction and operations at the outset is more likely to re sult in a system that succeeds throughout the program lifecycle 7  R EFERENCES    DoD Archi t ect ure Fram ework W o rki ng Group DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.0” August 30, 2003 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The primary development effort of the C4ISR CORE methodology as implemented on the OSP program was completed by Michael Wood, Orbital Sciences Corporation and Marge Dyer, Vitech Corporation 9  B IOGRAPHY  Staci N.

4 Data mining 4.1 Association rule mining Data mining which is a recent hot research topic in the database field is a method of discovering useful information such as rules and previously unknown patterns existing behind data items It enables more effective utilization of transaction log data which have been just archived and abandoned Among the major applications of data mining is association rule mining so called 217\217basket analysis.\220\220 Each of the transaction data typically consists of a set of items bought in a transaction By analyzing them one can derive some association rule such as 217\21790 of the customers who buy both A and B also buy C.\220\220 In order to improve the quality of obtained rules a very large amount of transaction data have to be examined requiring quite a long time to complete First we introduce some basic concepts of association rule Let 000 000 001 000 1 001\000 2 001\002\002\002\001\000 000 002 be a set of items and 003 000 001 003 1 001\003 2 001\002\002\002\001\003 001 002 be a set of transactions where each transaction 003 002 is a set of items such that 003 002 004\000  n itemset 004 has support 005 in the transaction set 003 if 005  f transactions in 003 contain 004  here we denote 005 000 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 An association rule is an implication of the form 004 005 n  where 004\001 n 004 000  and 004 006 n 000 007  Each rule has two measures of value support and confidence  The support of the rule 004 005 n is 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002  The confidence 013 of the rule 004 005 n in the transaction set 003 means 013 of transactions in 003 that contain 004 also contain n  which can be written as 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002  For example let r 1 000 001 1 001 3 001 4 002  r 2 000 001 1 001 2 001 3 001 5 002  r 3 000 001 2 001 4 002  r 4 000 001 1 001 2 002  r 5 000 001 1 001 3 001 5 002 be the transaction database Let minimum  support and minimum confidence be 60 and 70 respectively First all itemsets that have support above the minimum support called large itemsets  are generated In this case the large itemsets are 001 1 002 001 001 2 002 001 001 3 002 001 001 1 001 3 002  Then for each large itemset 004  n association rule 004 t n 005 n 001 n 004 004 002 is derived if 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 t n 002 n minimum confidence  The results are 1 005 3 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 75 002 and 3 005 1 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 013\b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 100 002  The most well known algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm[1 We have studied several parallel algorithms for mining association based on Apriori One of these algorithms called HPA Hash Partitioned Apriori is discussed here Apriori first generates candidate itemsets and then scans the transaction database to determine whether each of the candidates satisfies the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence Using these results the next candidate itemsets are generated This continues until no itemset satisfies the minimum support and confidence The most naive parallelization of Apriori would copy the candidates over all the processing node and make each processing node scan the transaction database in parallel Although this works fine when the number of candidates is small enough to fit in the local memory of a single processing node memory space utilization efficiency of this method is very poor For large scale data mining the storage required for the candidates exceeds the available memory space of a processing node This causes memory overflow which results in significant performance degradation due to an excessive amount of extra I/Os HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among the processing nodes using a hash function as in the parallel hash join which eliminates broadcasting of all the transaction data and can reduce the comparison workload significantly Hence HPA works much better than the naive parallelization for large scale data mining The 022 th iteration pass 022  f the algorithm is as follows 1 Generate the candidate itemsets Each processing node generates new candidate itemsets from the large itemsets of the last  001 022 t 1 002 th iteration Each of the former itemsets contains 022 items while each of the latter itemsets contains 001 022 t 1 002 items They are called 022 itemsets and 001 022 t 1 002 itemsets respectively The processing node applies the hash function to each of the candidates to determine the destination node ID If the candidate is for the processing node itself it is inserted into the hash table otherwise it is discarded 13 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
