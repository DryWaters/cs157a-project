FUZZY SPATIAL DATA MINING George Brannon Smith Susan M Bridges Department of Computer Science Box 9637 Mississippi State University Mississippi State MS 39762 e-mail: brannonsmith yahoo.com bridges@cs.mssstate.edu Abstract A fuzzy spatial data mining technique has been developed to extract relationships describing relative position of classes of objects from raster images Several different rule forms are described which represent different types of directional relationships between classes of objects 
The method has been tested with hand-generated synthetic and sonar imagery Keywords data mining, spatial relations fuzzy data mining association rules, spatial data mining 1.0 Introduction Rapid advances in computing power storage capacity and collection techniques have caused dramatic increases in the rates at which data are being collected 221Ihe research areas of data mining and knowledge discovery in databases have developed in response to the need for methods to automatically analyze this data and extract useful new knowledge implicit in the data Remote sensing technologies 
have accounted for an explosive growth in the quantity of spatial data collected including satellite images or sonar images Many data mining techniques that were originally developed for transaction data have been adapted for spatial data mining Koperski Han and Adhikary 5 define spatial data mining as 223the extraction of implicit knowledge spatial relations or other patterns not explicitly stored in spatial databases.\224 This definition assumes that the spatial data will be stored in a spatial 
database However much spatial data remains in raster form in flat files We extend the previous definition to cover all collections of spatial data not just spatial data bases One aspect of data mining is the extraction of relationships among objects that are typical in certain data sets We describe a method for extracting rules that describe relative position relationships typically found among classes of objects in images Relative position is a prototypical vague concept A statement such as 223X is north of Y\224 may be 
true to a degree and 0-7803-74614/02/$17.00 0 2002 IEEE 184 is conveniently represented using fuzzy logic Likewise as statement such as 223objects of type A are typically north of objects of class B\224 is also vague and amenable to fuzzy logic representation We have developed a fuzzy adaptation of association rule mining for mining descriptions of directional relationships between classes of objects in image data sets 2.0 Related Work In 1993 Agrawal Imielinski and Swami presented 
their theory of association rule mining for finding generalizations in a database I The traditional form of such an association rule is the implication antecedent consequent c confidence s SUPPOfi where the antecedent consists of one or more items in the transaction base being mined and the consequent consists of an item not in the antecedent Later interpretations allow for logical forms beyond implication The support metric is the percentage of all transactions in the database containing 
both the antecedent and the consequent and it measures the significance of the rule in the database The confidence is the percentage of those transactions containing the antecedent that also contain the consequent  the strength of the rule Subsequent research has extended the technique to categorical attributes and quantitative attributes Kuok Fu and Wong were one of the first groups to adapt the techniques to extract fuzzy association rules from quantitative data 6 Their method allows the items in both the 
antecedent and the consequent to be fuzzy sets An example might be capacity high a margin low c=90 21 Spatial data mining presents additional challenges not encountered in transaction data mining Shekhar et al lo state that 223extracting interesting and useful patterns from spatial datasets is more difficult than extracting corresponding patterns from traditional numeric and categorical data due to the complexity of spatial data types spatial relationships and spatial 


autocorrelation.\224 There is a large body of research in the area of spatial data mining The previous research efforts most relevant to ours deal with extraction of rules containing spatial predicates from spatial data and with generation of linguistic descriptions of relative position In the research area of rule extraction from spatial data Ordonez and Omiecinski  transform image data into traditional Boolean transactions thus enabling the application of retail-style association rule-mining They focus on simple object co occurrence and do not deal with other spatial relationships Koperski and Han 5 describe methods for spatial association rule discovery from spatial databases They define a spatial association rule as association which contains at least one spatial predicate Their rules have the restriction of always using a reference feature The Co-location Miner of Shekhar et al lo mines co-location relationships from Boolean spatial features without the use of a reference feature Our research differs from previous work because rather than using Boolean spatial features as a starting point for the mining process we use fuzzy relations-in particular fuzzy relations that describe the relative position of objects There is a long history of research in the area of generating descriptions of relative position of objects in images beginning with the seminal work of Winston in 1975[12 Many families of fuzzy directional relations have been defined and methods for computing these developed For example a number of these methods depend on the computation of a histogram of angles 8 Matsakis et al  a family of directional relations that rely on the computation of a histogram of forces Bloch 2 combines a morphological approach with fuzzy pattern matching to compute the fuzzy relative positions of two objects-the computation is done directly in image space We have used Bloch\222s method of computing fuzzy relative position in our work 3.0 Mining Fuzzy Spatial Association Rules The problem we are addressing is the following Given a segmented classified raster image generate rules that describe commonly found directional relationships that exist between classes of objects Because of the inherent imprecision in directional relationships, due in part to morphology the resulting rules will be fuzzy We have combined the fuzzy association rule approach of Kuok Fu and Wong 6 with the methods of Bloch for finding fuzzy spatial relationships 2 to develop a method for extracting fuzzy spatial rules from an image We restrict our attention to raster data operating in image space as opposed to object space The use of Bloch\222s approach allows implicit consideration of spatial object morphology When used in conjunction with techniques for fuzzy association rule mining information can be mined that describes the certainty of the extracted rules in terms of a fuzzy membership interval In the following sections we describe the fuzzy relations that are used as the starting point for our mining process the fuzzy rule forms that we have developed, and the mining algorithm 3.1 Fuzzy Spatial Relations We apply Bloch\222s 2 fuzzy spatial techniques for 2D space applied to segmented and classified image data to produce fuzzy spatial relations between pairs of objects Given an image space S containing reference object R and another object A and a direction a the evaluation of the relative position of A with respect to R is given by a function of p&\(x and pA\(x for all x in S The possibility distribution p&x defines the 223fuzzy landscape\224 of R in direction a Figure 1 illustrates the fuzzy landscape of an object Figure 1 Fuzzy landscape of an object in direction 0 radians The possibility distribution p defines the membership of each pixel in an object A for all x in S In our current work we have used only crisp objects but the concepts extend naturally to accommodate fuzzy objects Fuzzy pattern matching between the two possibility distributions p&x and pA\(x results in three numbers, a necessity degree N a possibility 185 


degree I7 and an average measure M These three measures are defined by Bloch as follows R A  sup t[pU PA lES aP2 Given 0  01 o is an object in S C   cl c is a class label isa\(o ci where o E 0 A ci E C The relation is a crisp relation associating an object ox with a class label ci The relation 0  Or 9 09 1 N2 09  09  fl 09 1 I Or 09 E ox 0 A 09 is defined for all pairs of objects in S and has three associated membership values 1 M$2 A xpA\(x R x IAl where t is a fuzzy t-norm s is a fuzzy t-conorm suprenum is the least upper bound and infinum is the greatest lower bound The possibility is an optimistic result necessity is a pessimistic result and mean is the average membership degree over all the points Together they express the value and interval We use Bloch\222s definitions of fuzzy relative positon to define binary relations between objects of different classes Given the classes of all objects in an image we can form descriptive relations Da for pairs of objects as shown in Figure 2 This yields a transaction database of I 0 I I 0 I 1 I D I tuples for each image These fuzzy relations are used to form fuzzy spatial association rules M c[n!nl 3.2 Fuzzy Spatial Association Rules We have developed a number of rule forms that can express different types of relative position associations between objects of different classes One variation aggregates all objects of each class into large 223pseudo-objects\222\222 and mines associations between these pseudeobjects This approach supports a very efficient mining algorithm but in general we have found that it yields less information than rule forms that treat objects individually We describe two of these rule forms in the following section 3.2.1 Universally Quantified Rule Form The first rule form describes situations in which all objects in one class tend to be located in the same direction relative to all objects in a second class Rule Form 1 VxVy cZass\(a A object\(x A inCZass\(x A A cZass\(B A object\(y A inCZass\(y B  inDirection\(a x y S C or Given any class A object and any class B object it follows that the class B object will be located in direction a of the class A object with a certain confidence and support in the database We generally restrict a to the values 0 d2 n and 3d2 radians  We have investigated different methods for computing the support and confidence One method for computing support is in terms of pixels S  Sum\(NPA NP NPobj where NPA and NPB are the number of pixels in objects of classes A and B respectively and NPob is the number of pixels in all objects A second method computes support in terms of objects So  Sum\(NO NO NO The first method seems most applicable when objects differ significantly in morphology The second method works well for those cases in which the number of objects for which the relationship holds is more important than the size of those objects We have adapted Bloch\222s method for computing necessity mean and possibility of directional relationships between individual objects to the computation of similar metrics for association rule confidence e typically consider the four primitive directions D  Figure 2 Fuzy Relations Describing Relative Position of CWied Objects I 186

Figure 6 Objects from Figure 5 with High Scoring Rules In Figure 6 the objects in the two light shades of gray are those involved in the highest scoring rule derived This rule states that for every object of class K lightest gray there is an object of class L medium gray in the direction 3n/2 with support 63.4 and confidence in the interval 94.5 1001 This rule was judged to be both valid and interesting 5.0 Summary and Conclusion We have developed a method for mining fuzzy spatial association rules that express typical relative position relationships for classes of objects  We have developed several different rule forms involving both existential and universal quantifiers to capture these rules The method of Bloch for describing fuzzy relative position has been combined with methods for fuzzy association rule mining Experimental results demonstrate that we generate interesting often non  obvious rules using these methods Although we have restricted our attention to crisp objects, this approach is also easily extended to fuzzy objects Likewise the method could easily be modified to use other families of relations for relative position other than that defined by Bloch and additional spatial predicates Acknowledgement This work was partially funded by a grant from the Naval Oceanographic Office NAS1398033 D092 6.0 References  11 Agrawal R T Imielinski and A Swami 1993 Mining associations between sets of items in massive databases Proc I993 SIGMOD 222 Intentational Con on Management of Data Washington DC May 26-28 1993 NY pp 207 216 Bloch, Isabelle 1999 Fuzzy relative position between objects in image processing A morphological approach IEEE Transactions on Pattem Analysis and Machine Intelligence vol 21 no 7 pp 657-664 Bridges S M J Hodges B Wooley D Karpovich and G B Smith 223Knowledge discovery in an oceanographic database,\224 Applied Intelligence No 11 pp 135-48 1998 Keller J M and X Wang, \223Comparison of Spatial Relation Definitions in Computer Vision,\224 Proc ISUMA-NAFIPS 22295 pp 679-684 Koperski K and J Han 1995. \223Discovery of spatial association rules in geographic information databases.\224 In Adv in Spatial Databases Proc of the 41h Intemational Symp on Large Spatial Databases Portland Maine August 6-9 1995 pp 47-66, Springer Kuok C A Fu and M Wong 1998.

Figure 7 Correlations between query con straints and new indexed constraint the index attribute may have different ranges We iden tify all possible constraint introduction solutions as follows Algorithm For each constraint on the index attribute CO.Roj Step 1 find the least expensive association from a query constraint to i.e find the incoming link C~.R  CO.Roj with the fewest exceptions For exam ple if the cardinalities of El     E5 are nl   n5 and n4 5 nz _ n3 then the least expensive association for CO.R is c6.b  CO.R~,\(E  E4 Step 2 filter out all the exceptions that do not satisfy at least one of the query constraints C1.Rl    C12 We do not need to test the exceptions for the antecedent of the corresponding rule since they satisfy it by definition The constraint introduction solutions identified in our example are the following  Introduced Constraints Exceptions ele t El Cz.n,\(e    C12.nl2\(e el  E4 C1.h e    C5.nS e C~.R e     C12.nll e ele  E5 C1.nl e     C5.nS e C~.R e    C12.n12 e CO.Rol CO.RO2 CO.RO3 5 Optimizing OQL queries In the previous sections a series of algorithms were given to find a collection of constraint elimination or con straint introduction solutions In this section we show how the original query is transformed to its optimized form using the optimal solution. Consider the OQL query select x fromExtentX as x where C~.R and   and Cn 5.1 Heuristic H1 Let  Cil   Ci,},Ei  be the maintained con straints and the exceptions of a solution i Only the main tained constraints of the optimization solution should be tested on the objects of the whole extent however all the constraints should be tested on the exception cases and the objects that satisfy the maintained constraints but not the ones omitted should be removed from the result Hence the original query should be converted to the following one select x from Extent2 as x where Cil and   and Ci except Ei If we assume that tests on the query constraints take roughly the same time, the optimal solution is the one with fewest exceptions Ei 5.2 Heuristic H2 Let  Co.Roi Ei  be the index constraint and the corre sponding exceptions of a constraint introduction solution Instead of testing the query constraints C1.~l    C,.R on the entire extent Extent X we apply them only on the re sults of the subquery select x from Extent2 as x 40 where CO.R Since Co.Roi is a constraint on a cluster index attribute, the select operation is expected to be quite fast The original query is transformed to its more efficient form select x from 90 as x where Cl and    and C union Ei The exceptions Ei are merged to the result because they satisfy the query constraints but not the new index con straint Co.Roi Since the union operation is relatively cheap the optimal solution is the one that introduces the index con straint with the highest selectivity 6 Discussion We now look at two different scenarios and estimate the extent to which heuristics H1 and H2 speed up query exe cution The Jirst scenario concerns frequently executed queries Assume that the association rules which are used by algo rithm 3 are not modified We may optimize a query once at compilation time then execute its optimized form It is worth optimizing provided that the execution time of the optimized query is less than the execution time of the orig inal query For heuristic H1 this happens only if the time 132 


saved by omitting some constraints is greater than the time needed to remove the exceptions from the result except operation The more the eliminated constraints and the fewer the exceptions the better the optimization As one of the referees pointed out, the time saved by the elimina tion of constraints is CPU-related Since query execution is dominated by data access time this optimization is not expected to alter performance significantly It would help only in contexts rich in associations with few exceptions in which users express many constraints in their queries Heuristic H2 is expected to bring more significant ben efits Firstly, this optimization involves a union operation which is much cheaper than the except operation used in H1 Secondly instead of retrieving all the objects of an extent from the database we need only look at the subset retrieved through an indexed constraint Hence we save a considerable amount of data access time, spending a negli gible amount of CPU time in evaluating the additional con straint The second scenario concerns queries which are exe cuted only once In this case the time required for opti mization is significant. This time depends on the algorithm that finds associations between relaxed constraints and tight constraints \(see section 3 since this is the most expensive step in the optimization process This algorithm finds paths in a directed graph, and combines the exceptions associated with each edge of the path to derive the total exceptions for the path. Therefore its complexity is a function of i the av erage number of exceptions in the existing association rules and ii the number of different constraints found in the an tecedents and the consequents of the rules We have already implemented the algorithms for apply ing H1 the next step is to implement the corresponding al gorithms for H2 This should not be difficult since the main algorithm  finding associations between rule constraints  is common to the two heuristics We intend to set up an experimental model in order to evaluate H1 and H2 in the scenarios discussed above 7 Conclusion The use of association rules for query optimization is rel evant to both relational and object-oriented database sys tems There has been a lot of research on generating asso ciation rules and maintaining them in the presence of up dates Research has also focused on finding heuristics that take advantage of rules in order to optimize a query Most of this work 2 31 has considered integrity rules rather than association rules with exceptions Semantic optimiza tion heuristics were also applied without considering indi rect associations In this paper we implement algorithms that apply two optimization heuristics presented by Siegel et al taking account of both exceptions and indirect asso ciations We show how to use these heuristics to optimize an OQL query The complexity of the optimization process is closely related to the complexity of the constraint graph which represents the set of association rules in the data It also depends on the number of exceptions associated with each rule We have designed an experimental framework to evaluate the two optimization techniques both in the con text of queries repeated frequently over a period of time, and in the context of ad-hoc queries executed once only The re sults of this experimental work will be presented in a later paper 8 Acknowledgements We are grateful to the anonymous referees who read the paper carefully and critically and made many helpful suggestions Agathoniki Trigoni is supported by a scholar ship from the Greek Scholarships Foundation and is deeply obliged to the National Bank of Greece References I R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining asso ciation rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD Intl Conference on Management oj data pages 207-2 16 1993 2 U Chakravarthy J Grant and J Minker Logic-based ap proach to semantic query optimization ACM Transactions on Database Systems 15\(2 162-207 1990 3 J Grant, J.Gryz J Minker and L Raschid.
