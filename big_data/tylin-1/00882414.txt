Mining Term Association Rules for Automatic Global Query Expansion Methodology and Preliminary Results Jie Wei StCphane Bressan Beng Chin Ooi School of Computing National University of Singapore  weijie,steph,ooibc} @comp.nus.edu.sg Abstract In this paper we are looking at the mining of association between terms for the automatic expansion of queries The technique we use for the discovery of the associalions is association rules mining 9 The technique 
we propose is more flexible than previous techniques based on term co-occurrence since it takes into account not only the co-occurrence frequency but also the confidence and direction of the association rules We have been able to consistently improve the effectiveness of the retrieval over the set of 48 test queries on the Associated Press I990 news wires corpus of the l\222REC4 benchmark by query expansion using term association rules 1 Introduction Most user 
queries to search engines and information retrieval systems are short and incomplete attempts to describe or characterize the possible documents relevant to the queries It seems then natural to try and expand the queries with additional terms which are semantically and/or statistically associated with the original query terms To a query such as 223What are the predictions concerning the economic effects of the U.K.-Continent underwater tunnel?\222 documents mentioning the Chunnel or the cities of Calais and Folkestone may have some relevance since the trans-Manche tunnel is called 223Chunnel\224 and it links Calais 
to Folkestone These documents could be missed by a search restricted to the original query words Why not add these words to the query if we know they could be related to the relevant documents Such knowledge could be found in a thesaurus or a domain ontology but it could also be the result of the observation that documents in the collection the corpus which mention the word 223tunnel often mention the word 223Chunnel\224 or vice-versa for instance Since the manual construction of a thesaurus or of an ontology 
is an expensive task requiring several linguists 0-7695-0577-5100 10.00 0 2000 IEEE and domain experts menhonth the effectiveness of an automatic method based on the statistical analysis of the co-occurrence of words in the corpus is very attractive In this paper we are looking at the mining of association between terms for the automatic expansion of queries The technique we use for the discovery of the associations is association rules mining 9 The technique we propose is 
more flexible than previous techniques based on term co-occurrence since it takes into account not only the co-occurrence frequency but also the confidence and direction of the association rules We use the corpus of Associated Press news wires from TREC4 The corpus is composed of 78,321 documents and 50 topics queries are available together with the list of relevant documents In section 2 we introduce and summarize our position by presenting an example In section 3 we present the 
background techniques and tools association rule mining WordNet thesauri and discuss the relevant related work local and global query expansion relevance feedback or automatic thesaurus construction In section 4 we give the details of our methodology for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the query expansion method we are studying In section 5 we review the preliminary results of our empirical evaluation Finally we conclude and outline the next steps of our research 2 An example This example is 
the summary of the described results presented in  141 2.1 Query and Relevant Documents The corpus we are using for our evaluation is composed of news wires of the year 1990 Let us consider a query looking for news about the 223Status of nuclear proliferation treaties  violations and monitoring\224 There are 52 documents which are relevant to this query Here is one such document we chose a short document 366 


223The government said Wednesday that Portugal had sold Iraq uranium concentrate a material that could be used to produce nuclear weapons The Ministry for Industry and Energy said the government sold 252 tons of the concentrate to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission from 1980 to 1982 It said no sales were made a$er 1983 Under the contract Iraq agreed to use the uranium for purely peaceful ends and abide by the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty the ministry said in a statement A ministry spokesman said the concentrate sold to Iraq was not the enriched variety that can be used directly in nuclear weapons The government was responding to a report in a Spanish newspaper that said Portugal had exported 1,189 tons of uranium from 1980 to 1988 The report said much of the uranium was purchased by Iraq It suggested Iraq could have used the material to produce nuclear weapons.\224 2.2 Query Expansion Figure I shows the hypernyms/hyponyms and synoniyms in the WordNet 2,1 I thesaurus for the word 223treaty\224 The term 223treaty\224 is a hypernym of the terms 223alliance\224 223peace treaty\224 223peace\224 and 223convention\224 A convention is some kind of treaty WordNet also indicates 223SALT I\224 and 223SALT 11\224 which are the acronyms for the first and second treaties between the US and USSR resulting from the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks The term 223treaty\224 is a synonym of the respective terms 223pact\224 and 223accord\224 A treaty is an accord It is an hyponym of 223written agreement\224 A treaty is some kind of written agreement written greement  pact f accord  treaty  ___  Hypernym Synonym 4 Figure 1 Figure 2 shows the network of associated terms with the corresponding coefficients as obtained from the mining of association rules in the entire corpus as described in section 3.2 war union  U 219 01462 55474 56298 4 269 00545 33835 treaty unification   o/54 P 687 4 574 0020 verification Ural 27902 Vienna   Rule A  B support=S,confidence=C S,C Figure 2 Now we can try and improve the system precision and recall by expanding the initial query using the associated terms from the thesaurus or from the mined rules The expansion resulting from the use of one or more type of associations in the thesaurus suffers from the generality of this one Indeed many terms are not used in the corpus despite their semantic relevance For example although very relevant to the query term 223treaty\224 223SALT-I\224 and 223SALT-11\224 are never mentioned in the large corpus we use them for the expansion The mined rules on the contrary by constructer only consider terms from the corpus However the question of the performance improvement leads to the problem of choosing the type of rules and selecting and tuning the various parameters For instance which of the following rules should be chosen to expand the query treaty  U.S support=.01484 confidence=.56298 treaty  war support=.01219 confidence=.46269 treaty  union support=.01462, confidence=.55474 treaty  unification support=.00545, confidence=.20687 unification  treaty support=.00545 confidence=.33835 367

For this research we have opted for the vector space model In the vector space model the documents and queries are seen as vectors in a highly multidimensional space The orthogonal basis of this vector space is the set of unit vectors corresponding to individual terms A document is expressed as a vector whose coefficients are calculated from the occurrence and the frequency of the different terms inside one document called the term-frequency Such vectors are sparse relatively to the high number of terms from the entire corpus kept for indexing i.e the number of dimensions In other words a document is a vector with kth coefficients d or 0 depending whether the krh term appears d times in the documents or not Similarly a query is seen as a document and represented as a vector Documents are retrieved according to their similarity to the query Among the many metrics available for formally defining the notion of similarity we use a variant of the cosine similarity The cosine similarity computes the cosine of the angle between the query vector and the document vector Given a document vector d  d I=1 and a query q  q  I to  the cosine similarity value s  If q is co-linear to d i.e if the query contains the same terms as the document possibly with different but proportional frequencies then the document is absolutely similar to the query and the cosine value is 1 As the cosine value decreases towards 0 the angle between the two vectors increases and the document is said to be less similar to the query The number of occurrences of a term t in different documents is called the document frequency of the term The ratio of the total number of documents by the document frequency of a term t is called the support of the term and is written as s\(t\The variant we use tries to balance the importance of the roles played by the different terms in the query according to their selectivity in the corpus The coefficients or weights of the respective terms in the query vector are functions of their support As a result, terms appearing in many documents play a lesser role in the direction of the query vector The weighting function must be a monotonous function decreasing as the frequency increases. In  121 the authors discuss and study several term weighting functions We adopted the commonly use weighting function In l/s\(t We confirmed empirically for our corpus the superiority of the weighted cosine similarity to the plain cosine similarity Figure 3 shows the respective average precision of the two similarities for 10 recall levels over 48 queries 02 015 01 0 05 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 1 Recall Figure 3 The recall is defined as the number of relevant documents retrieved over the total number of relevant documents The precision is defined as the number of relevant document retrieved over the total number of documents retrieved 3.2 Term Associations Rules A term association rule is a rule of the form tl  t2 where tl and t2 are terms A rule is the product of the statistical analysis of a set of documents It is characterized by both the confidence and the support The support of a term or a set of terms is the ratio of the number of documents in which the term or each term of the set appears to the total number of documents The support of a term t is denoted s\(t The support of a set of terms ti  tn is denoted s\(tl  tn The support of a rule ti  t2 is the support of set  ti t2  s\(tl t2 It indicates the amount of positive examples that suggested the association The confidence of a rule tl  t2 is the ratio of the support of the rule to the support of ti 368 


c  s\(t t  s\(tJ A rule with a high confidence indicates that term t2 often occurs in a document where term t occurs A rule with high support indicates that many examples were found to suggest the rule 3.3 WordNet The WordNet thesaurus is the product of a research project at Princeton University It is an electronic lexical reference system for the English language whose design is inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory 2,11 Its relative comprehensiveness its free of charge distribution and the numerous tools and associated data sets accompanying it have made it a popular tool among text and natural language processing researchers It has the potential to become a standard and has already inspired compatible developments in other languages IO paving the road to multi and cross lingual applications In WordNet English nouns verbs adjectives and adverbs are organised into synonym sets called synsets Each synset consists of a list of synonymous word forms representing one underlying lexical concept Semantic pointers describe relationships between the synsets For instance the synset No. 0059280 1 represent the synonym set  221industry\222 221manufacture\222 221manufacturing\222 WordNet contains approximately 122,000 terms grouped into approximately 99,000 synsets and it is constantly being updated and extended The synset represents the synonym equivalence relation The main relations between synsets are the hyponym and hypemym  and meronym and holonym reciprocal relations For nouns only, there are 78,000 Hyponym/Hypemym pairs 12,000 MeronymslHolonyms pairs in WordNet An 223oak\224 synset 07925865 is a kind of 223tree\224 synset 09396070 This is an example of hyper/hyponym relation Synset 07925865 is a hyponym of synset 09396070 and synset 09396070 is a hypernym of 07925865 These relations are anti-symmetrical The depth of this hierarchy is less than 12 synsets A 223pitcher\224\(synset 004642 13 is a part of a\224basebal1 team\224 synset 06022036 This is an example of mero/holonym relation Synset 00464213 is a meronym of synset 06022036 and synset 06022036 is a holonym of synset 004642 13 3.4.Query Expansion and Thesauri Whether they are well-formed affirmations or questions or ungrammatical lists of words, queries in the information retrieval models we consider boil down to often short and incomplete sets of terms Query expansion hypothesizes that the addition of terms to the query has the potential to overcome these weaknesses and improve the effectiveness of the retrieval The empirical results from various authors show unfortunately that improvement is difficult to achieve Several authors seem to suggest from their experience that improvements of 5 to 10 are very significant achievements  151 Let us classify the expansion methods according to two criteria into four categories An expansion method may be using local or global knowledge i.e look at the answers to a query or at the entire corpus An expansion method may be using human input or be fully automatic Global methods use the entire corpus or external knowledge to expand the query The knowledge used comes in the form of a thesaurus A thesaurus is a data structure recording associations between terms Man made Thesaurus such as WordNet whether they are general purpose of domain specific records linguistic or conceptual associations between the terms as identified by human experts In 5 and the authors report various experiments with the WordNet thesaurus In 5 they manually expand the queries using all relations in the thesaurus hyper/hyponyms and synonyms After tuning of parameters and weights, they report up to 1.7  improvement of the average precision over several levels of recall The experiments use a TREC3 corpus In  they only use the synonym relations The expansion is automatic but applies to both the query and the documents Several authors have attempted to automatically mine the associations for query expansion from the corpus Most approaches are based on clustering of terms in the document space Intuitively clustering captures synonymous associations In  the authors present a global analysis approach based on association rules mining However their objective is not to find associations for query expansion but rather to construct a classification of the documents The local set of documents is the small set retrieved with the initial unexpanded query. Local methods use the local set to discover the additional candidate terms to be added to the query The user may indicate which documents are relevant in the local set This is called relevance feedback In that case the frequent words in the relevant documents can be used to expand the initial query and/or re-weight the query terms The first positive result with such a technique was obtained by Salton as early as 1971in the SMART system Alternatively 369 


associations of terms within the local set can be mined and chosen automatically by methods similar to the one we are studying in this paper Like the global methods most of the proposed techniques are based on clustering In 8 the authors use the confidence of the association between terms they call the conditional probability to construct a term hierarchy from the local set They do not take the support of the terms and of the association into account Although they indicate that such a hierarchy can be used for manual or automatic query expansion they do not further study the issue For a more exhaustive overview of earlier work on local and global query expansion as well as thesauri construction see 12 The method we are studying is a global automatic query expansion method There are few available studies on such methods for significantly large corpus as the experiments are lengthy and greedy in memory utilization 4 Methodology 4.1 The Corpus and the Topics For this experiment we chose one of the TREC4 corpus namely AP90 a collection of news wires from 1990 by the Associated Press The corpus contains more than 78,000 documents. After stemming and the filtering of stop words see below we found more than 133,000 different terms The average number of different terms in a document is 217 The largest documents contain approximately 900 terms and the smallest 5 terms Figure 4 shows the distribution and the cumulative distribution of the ration of the number of documents over the document frequency of the terms There are many terms, which appear in very few documents Term dstribution \(freq from 1 to 50 0 5101523253035404550 Term irecyency Figure 4 From this graph we can see most terms are very infrequent More than 70 of them appear in less than 6 documents and only 10 appear in more than 50 documents There are 50 queries called topics in the TREC terminology associated with AP90 which consist of natural language propositions and questions For each of these topics a list of relevant documents has been constructed manually and endorsed by human experts This list is provided together with the topic. On average a topic for AP90 calls for 32 documents The largest topic calls for 145 documents Two topics call no relevant document at all Our measure being the relative recaWprecision performance we eliminated these two topics from our statistics at recall loo i.e an empty answer any method results in a maximum precision of 100 4.2 Summary Architecture and System Implementation We use the Oracle 8 database as a repository for the documents and indices we build The application programs for the processing of documents and queries are written in Java and use SQL through JDBC to query the database The system is composed of four main modules the indexing module the association rule miner the query expander and the query processor The indexing module constructs an inverted index of the corpus after tokenizing and stemming of the words in each document The tokenizer identifies the terms on the basis of a set of simple rules \(essentially white space and punctuation separation as well as eliminates the stop words The stop words list we use is the one provided with the WordNet thesaurus It contains some 600 words Although we could have later used the term frequency to eliminate stop words on a statistical criterion we felt that the filtering of a stop word list would be practical The tokens or words are then stemmed using the standard Porter stemming algorithm which we extended using the stemming rules included into the WordNet distribution These rules essentially govern the declension of irregular nouns and adjectives and the conjugation of irregular verbs We call terms the stemmed tokens Finally the inverted index simply consists of a table recording in which document a term appears It is clear to us that although very simple and convenient, this data-structure is not the most appropriate for efficient query processing The query processor computes a weighted-cosine similarity The query is processed in the same way 370 


documents are processed Each term in the query is weighted according to a function of its actual frequency in the corpus. Both the query and the documents are seen as vectors and the cosine of the two vectors is computed The query expansion module uses alternatively one of the term relation either constructed by the association rule miner or from WordNet we translated the main WordNet relations into terms and stored them into Oracle 5 Experimental results In the experiments each query and document is treated as a vector in the space of terms We compute the cosine value of the query and each document to measure the similarity between them See the formula in section 3.1 The query terms are weighted using the method mentioned in the same section After the cosine value of each document computed they are ranked by their value in descend order Using this ranked list we compute precision value at recall point from 0.1 to 1 O Take query 202 for example it has 52 relevant documents So the recall point 0.1 means the point of the first 5 relevant documents are retrieved say it\222s the nth document Then the precision is 5111 The graphs below show the average precision of each recall point among the 48 topics The higher the corresponding plots the more effective the retrieval 5.1 Query Expansion using WordNet Average precision using expansion methOd\(W0rdrlet Noexpansim  Expansion with Wordhlet\(H pernym x  Expansion wim Wmme*\(Jynmym   Expanson wlthWordNet\(Hypmym  U I 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 1 Recall Figure 5 If we use the WordNet associations to expand the query we do not observe consistent improvement Figure 5 shows the effectiveness of the expanded query in comparison to the initial query The random performance has numerous causes one important one being the fact that the general thesaurus although semantically ideal may not reflect the vocabulary jargon and usage within the corpus The 223SALT-I\224 and 223SALT-11\224 are examples of this kind Expansion with Hypernym or Synonym changes the performance little But expansion with Hyponym hurts the performance much It\222s because Hyponyms are narrower meaning words of the query terms A query term might be expanded with many of it\222s specific meaning words which are not related to the query An example is term \223status\224 in topic 202, which is \223Status of nuclear proliferation treaties  violations and monitoring\224 There are 146 kinds of 223status\224 such as 223safe\224 223danger\224 etc Many of them are not relevant to the topic 5.2 Query Expansion using Association Rules Q=>X No expansron t g 0.2  0.15 0.1 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Recall Figure 6 Figure 6 shows the performance of expansion with terms implied by the query terms When using the association rules we need set a low-bound of support Rules with support below this bound are thought appear by casual We select rules whose support is bigger than 0.001 That means the query word and expanded words co-occurred in at least 0.1 of the documents Since the AP90 is topic diverse, this support is not low The parameters are chosen by hand, but it\222s applied to all 48 queries This method improves the first 4 recall points and degrades a little in the rest In real retrieval system users focus on the former ones They wish a good quality in high ranked documents rather than the overall performance We have eliminated the stop words when created the inverted index. But there are still some words appear in too many documents in the corpus. A typical example is the word 221report\222 It\222s often in the news but not a common stop word In AP90 it appeared in30,302 out of 78,321 documents These words are noise and will hurt the retrieval so we tried to set a high-bound for the support of expanded words The performance is shown in Figure 7 371

However the tuning of the main parameters for the selection of the rules the ranges of the support and the confidence was done in a non-systematic way due to the duration of each experiment Such a running is possible with association rules since they add more control parameters confidence and direction to the previously proposed methods based on the sole term co-occurrence Encouraged by these preliminary results yielding a rare performance increase of up to 5 we are now embarking on the systematic evaluation of the influence of the parameters 6.2 Polysemy and Disambiguation An important property of words and terms is their ability to have several concurrent meaning This maybe undesirable feature is called polysemy The term 223Java\224 for instance can refer to the popular programming language the popular coffee, which gave its name to the programming language or the popular tourist destination, which gave its name to the coffee In a query 223Development programs in the island of java\224 only the co-occurrence of the terms 223island\224 and 223java\224 which happen to have a direct hypernym relation in this case can help resolve the ambiguity which is unfortunately reinforced by the terms 223program\224 and 223development\224 We would like to study the opportunity for such disambiguation using direct or indirect relations from mined term associations This could potentially help prevent the expansion to words like 223soyabean\224 in queries of the form 223nuclear plant\224 Indeed the general form of association rules can be t   tk  tL    t 6.3 Multi Lingual Applications Finally a next objective of this research is to mine term associations for corpus written in languages for which Thesaurus such as WordNet are not readily available or too expensive We wish to study text information retrieval and query expansion for languages such as Malay/Indonesian and Mandarin with respectively two hundred and twenty million and one billion native speakers joining the information society References 131 Ellen M Voorhees and Yuan-Wane Hou 223Vector Expansion in a Large Collection First Text REtrieval Conference TREC-I 1993 4 R.Richardson A.F.Smeaton and J.Murphy 223Using WordNet as a Knowledge Base for Measuring Semantic Similarity between Words 222\222 5 E.M.Voorhees 223Query Expansion using Lexical-Semantic Relations 224 ACM-SIGIR 1994 6 W.R.Greiff 223A Theory of Term Weighting Based on Exploratory Data Analysis\224 ACM SIGIR. 1998 7 S.H Lin C.S Shih M.C Chen J.M Ho M.T KO and Y.M Huang 223Extracting Classification Knowledge of Internet Documents with Mining Term Associations A Semantic Approach 224 ACM SIGIR 1998 8 M.Sanderson and B.Crofi 223Deriving Concept Hierarcbies from Text 224 ACM SIGIR, 1999 9 Agrawal R Imielinski T and Swami A 223Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases 224 Procedings ofthe ACM SIGMOD, 1996 IO EuroWordnet 223Building a Multilingual Database with Wordnets for several European Languages 223 littp:/l~~.wM;.lium.u\\;a.nl/-cwn I I Wordnet 223 WordNet  a Lexical Database for English 222 httn:iiM:\\y\\v.cogsci princeton.ed ti-wn I21 W Greif 223A Theory of Term Weighting Based on Exploratory Data Analysis 224 ACM SIGIR 1998  131 R Baeza-Yates B Ribeiro-Neto 223Modem Information Retrieval.\224 1999 I41 J.Wei Z.Qin S.Bressan and BC.Ooi 223Mining Term Association Rules for Global Query Expansion A Case Study with Topic 202 from TREC4\224 Information Systems 2000 Americas Conference 2000  I51 S.Jones K and Bates 223Research on automatic indexing 1974-1976.\224 Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge 1977 I A.F Smeaton and I.Quigley 223Experiments on Using Semantic Distances Between Words in Image Caption Retrieval 224 Intemational Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval 1996 2 G.A.Miller R.Beckwith C.Felbaum D.Gross and K.Miller 223lntroduction to WordNet An On-line Lexical Database 224 Revised Version 1993 373

All requirements of this section apply in the vicinity of uninsulated but covered wires e.g weatherproof wires Requires employees to treat ungrounded metal parts of equipment transformer cases and breaker housing as energized unless known by test to be free from voltage Comments I APPA comments that it is impossible to enforce paragraph l\(3 which addresses the working position Situations arise where it is impossible to prevent contact APPA recommends that l\(3 be reworded to add where practicable and comments that work should generally be done from below rather than above energized parts APPA also recommends inclusion of reference to Tables 422-2 and 427-2 from the 1987 NESC which allows reduced clearances if switching surges are known The comparable tables in the current 1993 NESC are 441-3 and 441-4 EEI has expressed particular concern about the Clearance Section 1 with reference to maintenance of transmission facilities EEI has attached an extensive proposed revision to this section which includes clearance tables which are different than the ones included in the proposed Rules Their tables also include reduced clearances for situations where known transient overvoltage factors are present for transmission voltages 121 kV and greater Their attachment also includes calculations and backup material from which their proposed tables were derived This proposed attachment is in the form of a working agreement of EEI/lBEW Portions of the attachments which do not agree with IBEWs recommendations are indicated In a departure from the proposed Rules and the current 1993 NESC EEI proposes that facilities 300 volts and less not require the use of insulated equipment rubber gloves IBEW was not in concurrence with this proposal at the time it was submitted  1 Deenergizing Lines and Equipment for Emvlovee Protection m This section is analogous to section d which is included for power generation plants It applies to the deenergization of transmission and distribution lines and equipment for the purpose of protecting employees Included is a detailed procedure for deenergizing facilities if an employee must depend on others to operate switching to deenergize lines on which the employee is to work including transfer of responsibility, tagging and grounding Comments ml Both EEI and APPA recommend that this section be revised to cover only systems 600 volts and greater Additionally APPA and EEI comment that lockout procedures which are included in this section and the preceding section d should have a provision that the utility may use its own procedures if developed documented and implemented prior to the promulgation of these regulations EEI proposes a fairly extensive revision to Section m\which includes the following major changes from the OSHA version Places greater emphasis on the system operator in the lockout/tagout procedures Provides for record keeping of the operations by the system operator Places reduced emphasis on the original person requesting the clearance on the applicable lines Groriiidina for the Protection of Emvlovees n This section includes requirements for the protective grounding of transmission and distribution lines and equipment for the purpose of protecting employees For employees to work on lines which are treated as deenergized these lines must be deenergized A2-9 


according to section m and grounded Under certain unusual conditions the facilities need not to be grounded in accordance with these requirements There must be 1 no possibility of contact with another energized source and 2 no hazard of induced voltage This section Requires temporary protective grounds at each work location or on either side of the location if one location is not feasible Requires grounding equipment to have proper ampacity No 2 AWG copper minimum and low enough impedance to permit operation of protective devices in case of accidental energization Requires testing before grounding to determine absence of voltage Requires the ground end of the protective ground to be connected first, then the line end, using an insulated device Requires removal first from the line end using an insulated device Prohibits grounding cables at a remote location if a hazardous transfer of potential could occur under fault conditions Allows grounds to be temporarily removed for tests but requires previously grounded line to be considered energized during to test Comments n APPA comments that this section on grounding should apply to systems greater than 600 volts only Additionally both EEI and APPA submitted similar comments regarding flexibility which should be included to allow either single or dual point grounding or a combination of the two methods to allow employers to choose the method best for the particular situation APPA recommends that grounding should be allowed on lines where nominal voltage is not found In many cases facilities may be grounded when induced or static voltages are present APPA also comments that removal of grounds for cables being tested with low voltage should not require treatment of these cables as energized EEI believes that OSHA's requirement to require work location grounding where feasible is not workable, objecting to the word feasible as all encompassing Testing and Test Facilities 0 This section covers the proposed safe work practices for high-voltage and high-power testing performed in laboratories in shops and in substations under the exclusive control of an electric utility It does not cover routine functions for metering, relaying and normal line work Requirements addressed include the following Guarding of test areas  walls fences and barriers Grounding practices  similar to grounding requirements of other sections but requires isolated ground-return conductor system for high current testing Control and measuring circuits Safety check of test areas at beginning of each group of continuous tests Comments 0 APPA provided the following comments on this section Recommends clarification of the wording so that there is a clear distinction between this specialized testing and routine operations such as phasing and low voltage testing Recommends deletion of the requirement for an isolated ground return during high current testing citing that staged fault tests often involve large areas which would not allow this requirement to be met  asks that A2-10

is that this requirement is sufficiently performance oriented to meet the requirements for old installations according to the 1987 NEW Requires draw-out circuit breakers to be inserted and removed while in the open position and that if the design permits the control circuits be rendered inoperative while breakers are being inserted and removed stated in the Rules and requests that existing installations not be required to be modified to meet NESC APPA recommends that Section u 4 i which includes requirements for enclosing electric conductors and equipment to minimize unauthorized access to such equipment be modified to refer to only those areas which are accessible to the public Requires conductive fences around substations to be grounded Power Generation v Addresses guarding of energized parts  Fences screens, partitions or walls This section provides additional requirements and related work practices for power generating plants  Entrances locked or attended Special Conditions w  Warning signs posted  Live parts greater than 150 volts to be guarded or isolated by location or be insulated  Enclosures are to be according to the 1987 NESC Sections llOA and 124A1 and in 1993 NESC  Requires guarding of live parts except during an operation and maintenance function when guards are removed barriers must be installed to prevent employees in the area from contacting exposed live parts Requires employees who do not work regularly at the substation to report their presence Requires information to be communicated to employees during job briefings in accordance with Section \(c of the Rules Comments U APPA and EEI provide comments as follows Both believe that some older substations \(and power plants would not meet NESC as This paragraph proposes special conditions that are encountered during electric power generation, transmission and distribution work including the following Capacitors  Requires individual units in a rack to be short circuited and the rack grounded  Require lines with capacitors connected to be short circuited before being considered deenergized Current transformer secondaries may not be opened while energized and must be bridged if the CT circuit is opened Series street lighting circuits with open circuit voltages greater than 600 volts must be worked in accordance with Section q\or t and the series loop may be opened only after the source transformer is deenergized and isolated or after the loop is bridged to avoid open circuit condition Sufficient artificial light must be provided where insufficient naturals illumination is present to enable employee to work safely A2-17 


US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
