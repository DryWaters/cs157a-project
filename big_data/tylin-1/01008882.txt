Clusterwise Data Mining Within a Fuzzy Querying Interface Janusz Kacprzyk Jan W Owsinski and Slawomir Zadroiny''2  Systems Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences ul Newelska 6,01447 Warsaw Poland  University of Information Technology and Management ul Newelska 6,0147 Warsaw Poland E-mail Janusz.Kacprzyk@ibspan.waw.pl AbstrmL This paper is a further development of a combined fuzzy querying and data mining paradigm The point of departure is the FQUERY for Access Kacpnyk and Zadroiny 8-121 Its earlier version e.g It 121 offered 
the generation of fuzzy association rules within the fuzzy querying interface We report on extensions to a wider range of available data mining tools mainly from cluster analysis and more specifically, a clustering algorithm by Owsinski and Zadroiny 20,21,22 The data to be clustered is first fuzzified using a dictionary of linguistic terms Additionally, the resulting clusters are helpful in running other data mining tools notably the generation of association rules INTRODUCTION Data mining provides tools for discovering regularities in data. No single tool may take into account all possible types of such regularities Thus the construction of an interface combining several tools seems to be worthwhile In our previous works 
we developed the FQUERY for Access a fuzzy querying interface based on Microsoft Access This tool itself provides interesting data mining capabilities making it possible to formulate and execute intelligent queries using linguistic terms and non conventional aggregation \(connectives of atomic conditions Obviously it is primarily a querying interface, thus its data analysis capability is user-driven The user has still to conceive a query The fuzzy interface makes it is much easier to construct such a query Our next step was to implement a support for so-called database summaries within that fuzzy querying interface We proposed algorithms for deriving various types of summaries  11,12,13,14 More 
sophisticated ones require complex computations. The most general correspond to fuzzy IF-THEN rules Their generation faces combinatorial explosion To circumvent computational complexity we experimented with two approaches The first not directly related to the fuzzy querying interface, consists in application of genetic algorithms. Starting with a general idea of George and Srikant 4 very promising results with a genetic algorithm based system for generation of database summaries were obtained by Kacprzyk and Strykowski 6,7 The second approach boils down to a simplification of an IF-THEN rule to an association rule that can be mined by some efficient algorithms  1,24,18 Thus FQUERY for Access offered both a limited data mining functionality 
via intelligent fuzzy querying and a full fledged data mining feature provided by linguistic database summaries generation, including association rules mining. A motivation for a further extension of this interface was to implement a support for more sophisticated fuzzy association rules and another data mining technology i.e cluster analysis within the same integrated fuzzy querying interface We employ a clustering tool by Owsihski implemented by Owsinski and Zadroiny 22 Another reason was that the previous implementation of the association rules mining was not efficient enough. We redesigned in the sense of software engineering\a part of our interface, too Section 2 contains a brief description of the FQUERY for Access fuzzy querying interface Section 3 shows the implementation of database summaries within that package Section 4 presents the clustering analysis algorithm 
employed Finally in Section 5 we present the position and role of clustering within the FQUERY for Access FUZZY QUERYING IN FQUERY FOR ACCESS The fuzzy querying implemented in the FQUERY for Access provides for a direct use of linguistic terms in queries Our point of departure is the standard syntax of the SQL query the SELECT instruction Then we offer a more flexible syntax of the condition in the WHERE clause For example, instead of age<20 it may be age is young The meaning of linguistic terms is vague and we have to use special means to deal with them Moreover, we assume that instead of listing a crisp set of matching database rows a fuzzy query against precise 
data yields a fuzzy set of such rows each accompanied by its matching degree The linguistic terms used may be numerical fuzzy values exemplified by low in profitability is low scalar fuzzy values exemplified by Central Europe in country is in Central Europe fuzzy relations exemplified by much greater than in income is much greater than spending and 
linguistic quantifiers exemplified by most in most conditions have to be met and they he building blocks of fuzzy queries Similarly to linguistic quantifiers, they are all are represented as fuzzy sets fuzzy trapezoidal numbers Often a separate repertoire of linguistic terms may be required for each attribute. However it also possible to define universal numerical fuzzy values applicable for any numerical attribute They are defined as fuzzy sets on a universal interval IO lo and are converted to the ranges of particular attributes as needed 0-7803-7293-X/01/$17.00 0 2001 IEEE 1239 2001 lEEE lnternational Fuzzy Systems Conference 


Usually a query consists of a number of simple conditions combined by the classical AND and OR Linguistic quantifiers provide a more flexible aggregation as e.g instead of requiring all simple conditions to be are met we may require most of them to be met FQUERY for Access maintains a dictionary of linguistic terms defined by users as well as predefmed ones This feature supports both fuzzy querying and data mining FQUERY for Access was implemented as an add-in to Microsoft Access providing the user of this popular desktop DBMS with fuzzy querying cf 8-141 DATA MINING VIA THE GENERATION OF ASSOCIATION RULES IN FQUERY FOR ACCESS Yager 25 proposed to use linguistically quantified propositions in the sense of Zadeh 28,29 to summarize the content of a database We followed and extended this idea in the context of the FQUERY for Access The calculus of linguistically quantified propositions provides the semantics for such propositions being essentially different than in the classical logic Consider e.g the proposition Most transactions were profitable First the property of objects transactions is described imprecisely Second the objects are quantified using a linguistic quantifiers most instead of the classical Ifor each or there exists The calculus of linguistically quantified propositions makes possible to calculate the truth values of this type of propositions Additionally a counterpart of the scope of a quantifier, considered in the classical logic is here taken into account making it possible to deal also with the propositions exemplified by Most recent transactions are profitable The linguistically quantified propositions are well suited to summarize the content of a database For example, having a database on transactions in a company, one may be interested to know if most of them are profitable There are two issues related to the processing of such summaries How to evaluate the corresponding linguistically How to come up guess conceive with such The former may easily be solved via the FQUERY for Access The fuzzy querying interface alone does not directly handle for now linguistic quantifiers so that we may treat a summary as a fuzzy query \(the syntax of queries accepted by the FQUERY for Access will soon be extended to accommodate this However the FQUERY for Access supports not only fuzzy querying but also data mining so that it is possible to request practically any summary The latter problem is much more complex The examples of summaries linguistically quantified propositions discussed so far were fairly simple but other summaries of a richer structure should be taken into account too Similarly to the queries, summaries may also employ various connectives as e.g Most young employees are well-educated and poorly paid Thus the evaluation of all possible summaries quickly becomes a computationally hard problem quantified propositions  and even more basic summaries We proposed a typology of the summaries For simpler ones we proposed direct derivation schemes For more complex ones we proposed simplifications and then studied how to generate them This typology may be briefly described as follows Most e young employees F are well-educated and where Q is a linguistic quantifier F is its scope may be interpreted as a fuzzy filter in the context of a database and S is the main body of a summary may be interpreted as a WHERE clause of the FQUERY for Access fuzzy query Thus the generation of a linguistic summary consists in finding propositions of type 1 that have a high truth-value Two extreme strategies, indicated previously are possible either the user proposes a candidate summary and the system just evaluates its truth degree or the very summary is not only evaluated but also automatically generated by the system In-between these two extremes there are different types of summaries with various assumptions on what is automatically generated \(sought\and what is provided by the user In case of Q the situation is simple it may be given or sought In case of F and S more possibilities exist. Basically both F and S consist of simple conditions, each stating what value an attribute should take on connected using logical connectives. Then we distinguished five types of summaries cf 12 For the most complex ones of Type 5 the whole structure and all components is to be automatically generated From now on we deal only with the summaries of Type 5 that are a counterpart of a fuzzy rule describing dependencies between specific values of attributes. Their meaning is that if a row meets the filter's condition then it also meets the query's conditions For a general form of such a summary it is difficult to devise an effective and efficient generation algorithm Thus we investigated the similarity of Type 5 summaries to association rules  13 Originally, the association rules were defined for binary valued attributes as AIAA~A AA A 2 poorly paid S 1 Thus, an association rule states that if in a database row all attributes from the set Al A2 A take on value 1 then also attribute A,,+I is expected to take on value 1 Algorithms proposed for mining the association rules are based on the following A row in a database table supports a set of attributes Ai}i if attributes from this set take on in this row value 1 The support of rule 2 is the fraction of the number of rows supporting the set Ai i\200  l,..,n+l in a database table The confidence of a rule in a database table is the fraction of the number of rows supporting the set Az ie  1  n+l among all rows supporting the set A iE  1  n The algorithms 11,181 search for rules having values of support above some minimal threshold and a high value of confidence. These algorithms may easily be adopted for non binary valued data and more sophisticated rules than 2  In particular we can considerfuzzy association rules 3 AI IS SI A A2 IS Sl A...A A IS S 3 A,+I IS Sn+l 1240 


where Si is a fuzzy set defmed in the domain of attribute Ai i.e a fuzzy value; this is just an example of a fuzzy IF-THEN rule. Thus a fuzzy association rule may be treated as a special case of a Type 5 summary where the structure of filter F and query S is rather limited but this simplicity secures the existence of efficient generation algorithms A benefit of data mining via a fuzzy querying interface is also implied by that a part of software modules may be used for both tasks In fact the simplest summaries may be produced as a by-product of running a query A CLUSTER ANALYSIS ALGORITHM A cluster analysis method based on a global objective function was first presented by Owsinski 20 and then extended in  Then it was applied by the present authors to a number of real-life data from a variety of domains Assume that a set of indices I of objects analyzed i ic I  1  n is to be partitioned into subsets clusters A forming the partition P  A that reflects in the best possible most faithful way geometrical properties of the entire set of objects with special emphasis on densities This means that in the partitions objects assigned to the same clusters A should be possibly close while objects assigned to different clusters  possibly far away from each other Following this verbal formulation the method employs an explicit objective function reflecting the quality of partitions denoted Qf P  which is composed of two parts QSD\(O  Q~\(P P 4 D where Q P is a function of distance between objects assigned to various clusters, defined over the whole space of partitions while Qs\(P is its intra-cluster similarity analogue Function Qf\(P is to be maximized and this allows  at least in principle  to determine both the composition of an optimal A and an optimum p the number of clusters This unique feature is the consequence of a global nature of 4 The generality of 4 is reflected through the possibility of accommodating a broad variety of formulations First instead of maximizing 4 we can minimize its 223dual\224 in which QD\(P is a function of distances between objects within the same clusters while P is the function of similarities between objects in different clusters Then, the function formulation is subject to choice driven by the problem and numerical capabilities In particular fuzzy elements may also be accommodated especially at lower levels values of variables distances/proximities  Yet according to the method proposed which includes also the respective algorithm of the search for a solution the formulations of 4 or its 223dual\224 are subject to a condition of algorithmic nature Namely for virtually all reasonable forms of 4 there are no effective exact optimization algorithms various metaheuristics are commonly employed Thus a compromise is to be found: while losing as little as possible out on optimality gain as much as possible in computational effectiveness. Hence 4 is transformed into in which rc 0,1 Then the function is suboptimized through a simple classical progressive merger procedure The procedure starts with r=l when the parametric function is equivalent to P whose maximization yields the optimum partition P*\(1  I i.e each object forms a separate cluster As r decreases consecutive partitions P*\(r are formed through mergers of clusters created at earlier stages To lead to a sub solution the condition of opposite monotonicity with respect to aggregation disaggregation of clusters is applied to the components of Qf P  It means that when we obtain from a given partition P another partition through a merger of arbitrary clusters then the resulting changes in the values of P and QdP should go in the opposite directions and with each possible aggregation these directions will for a given component always be the same It turns out that there exists a broad class of such  P and QS\(P cf Zl By employing functions that satisfy the 223opposite monotonicity\224 the applied progressive merger scheme comparable to those described with the Lance-Williams Jambu formula may yield suboptimum solutions This scheme is in general as effective as the latter ones and suboptimizes both the contents of clusters and their number The actual effectiveness of the algorithm will depend upon the form of P and QdP Additionally the algorithm is equipped with a natural index r of hierarchy whose values obtained during the functioning of the algorithm may serve to assess the robustness of individual partitions forming the hierarchical structure The ultimate suboptimal solution is obtained for the lowest value of r not smaller than 0.5 CLUSTER ANALYSIS WITHIN FQUERY FOR ACCESS The above cluster analysis algorithm was implemented within our combined fuzzy queryindmining interface for two reasons First to simply extend the range of tools. Second we follow the idea of Miller and Yang  191 by looking for a more sophisticated forms of summaries fuzzy association rules Now we will discuss both modes of application of cluster analysis in FQUERY for Access Our cluster analysis module implemented using BorlandInprise Delphi is integrated with the fuzzy querying interface but may be used in several modes It offers its own interface for setting all parameters needed \(distance functions selection for all relevant attributes type of parametrization etc and running cluster analysis on data taken from the host Access database It may also be controlled fiom the main interface of the FQUERY for Access and executed in the background This mode genuinely exploits the integration of the tools as the data to be clustered may be automatically prepared using a dictionary of linguistic terms from the fuzzy querying interface For example if we have three fuzzy values 223low\223 223medium\224 and 223high\223 represented by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers then if the attribute is 1241 


selected for the use in the clustering phase the user may request an automatic fuzzification of values of this attribute using the above fuzzy values Thus in the data set read by the clustering module instead of the actual values of salary there will be put fuzzy values The appropriate fuzzy values will be determined as those maximizing the membership degree of the actual value of salary in the fuzzy sets defining particular fuzzy values The user may also decide if the fuzzified attribute is to be treated by the clustering module as nominal ordinal or regular numerical one because the clustering module supports various distance functions also for qualitative data The second role of the clustering module within the queryingmining interface is to enhance the execution of other mining tool available This mainly deals with the discretizatiodpartition of domains of the attributes to be used by the association rules discovery module The use of numerical fiuzy values itself alleviates to some extent the problem of a proper partition of attribute domains A domain may be covered by a number of overlapping fuzzy values making the partitioning more flexible However sometimes such a coverage may be improper e.g due to data skewness An experienced user may even then defme appropriate fuzzy values However sometimes it may be useful to rely on an automatic partition of the feature space offered by the clustering module We implemented both one-dimensional clustering along the domain of each attribute separately as well as multi-dimensional clustering and the partition of the domains in the spirit of Fu et al 5 Finally we also adopted an approach in the spirit of Miller and Yang 19 They advocate the use bf cluster analysis to determine a proper partition of the attributes domain In fact they go even further by proposing an extension of the association rule concept Namely they suggest that it may be advantageous to group attributes provided the distance in corresponding multi dimensional spaces may be meaningfully defmed. Then in a simple condition of a rule  instead of requiring that a numerical attribute lies in a given interval  we may require that values of a group of attributes lie in a cluster We additionally propose to use the very clustering process for the association rules generation We start with the observation that a the rows gathered in the clusters of the size exceeding some threshold corresponding to the support threshold may be treated as revealing some fiequent patterns of data corresponding to the frequent/large itemsets REFERENCES R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules in Proceedings of the 20 International Conference on Very Large Databases, Santiago, Chile, 1994 T.M Anwar H.W Beck and S.B Navathe Knowledge mining by imprecise querying: A classification based system in Proceedings of the lnternational Conference on Data Engineering, Tampa USA 1992 P Bosc and J Kacprzyk, Eds Fuzziness in Database Management Systems.

major work is to find peculiar data in multiple relations for a given discovery task while foreign link relationships ex ist In other words our task is to select n relations which contain the peculiar data among m relations m 2 n with foreign links The method for selecting n relations among m relations can be divided into the following steps Step 1 Focus on a relation as the main table and find the peculiar data from this table Then elicit the peculiar ity rules from the peculiar data by using the methods stated in Section 4 Step 2 Find the value\(s of the focused key correspond ing to the mined peculiarity rule or peculiar data in Step 1 and change its granularity of the value\(s of the focused key if the background knowledge on informa tion granularity is available Step 3 Find the peculiar data in the other relations or databases\corresponding to the value or its granule of the focused key Step 4 Select n relations that contain the peculiar data among m relations m 2 n In other words we just select the relations that contain peculiar data relevant to the peculiarity rule mined from the main table A peculiarity rule can be discovered from peculiar data hidden in multiple relations by searching the relevance among the peculiar data If the peculiar data X\(x and Y\(y are found in two different relations we need to use a value or its granule in a key or foreign key/link as the relevance factor K\(lc to find the relevance between X\(z and Y\(y Thus the relevance between X\(z and Y\(y is evaluated by R2  Pl\(K\(lc z K\(lc Y 13 Region Yamaguchi    Furthermore, the above-stated methodology can be ex tended for mining from multiple databases A chal lenge in multi-database mining is a semantic heterogene ity among multiple databases because usually no explicit foreign key/link relationships exists among them Hence the key issue of the extension is how to findkreate the rel evance among different databases In our methodology we use granular computing techniques based on semantics, ap proximation and abstraction for solving the issue 8 201 We again use the illustrative example mentioned at Sec tion 2 If a manager of the supermarket found that the turnover was a marked drop in one day from a supermarket sale database he/she may not understand the deeper rea son Although rule1 as a peculiarity rule \(see Section 2 can be discovered from the supermarket-sales database, the deeper reason why the turnover was a marked drop is not explained well However if we search several related in formation sources such as a weather database as shown in Date   I Weather July-I   sunny July-2    cloud Table 5 Weather 1 t  1 July:30 1 t   I typhinino 2 I July-31 cloud     Table 5 we can find that there was a violent typhoon that day Hence we can understand the deeper reason why the turnover was a marked drop For this case, the granule of aa'dx  Ube in Table 1 needs to be changed into region  yamaguchi for creating explicit foreign link between the supermarket-sales database and the weather database. This example will be further described in the next section 5.2 Representation and Re-learning We use the RVER Reverse Variant Entity-Relationship model to represent the peculiar data and the conceptual re lationships among the peculiar data discovered from mul tiple relations databases 23 Figure l as an example shows the results mined from two databases on supermar ket sales at Yamaguchi prefecture and the weather of Japan The point of which the RVER model is different from an ordinary ER model is that we just represent the attributes that are relevant to the peculiar data and the related pecu liar data \(or their granules in the RVER model Thus, the RVER model provides all interesting information that is rel evant to some focusing e.g turnover  very-low region  yamaguchi and date  July-30 in the supermarket-sale database\for learning more interesting rules among multi ple relations \(databases Re-learning means learning more interesting rules from the RVER model For example, the following rule can be learned from the RVER model shown in Figure 1  rule2  weather\(typhoon  turnover very-low We can see that a manager of the supermarket may be more interested in rule2 rather than rulel because rule2 shows a deeper reason why the turnover was a marked drop 6 Concluding Remarks We presented a method of mining peculiarity rules from multiple databases and a formal interpretation and compar ison of three classes of rules association rules exception rules and peculiarity rules We showed that such peculiar ity rules represent a typically unexpected, interesting regu larity hidden in databases Here we should mention that Liu's group systemati cally investigated how to analyze the subjective interesting 572

The results have been partly discussed in our papers 23 241 Currently we are also working on the third level of the multi-database mining task that is mining from multiple mixed-media databases  171 Our fcture work includes developing a systematic method to nine the rules from multiple databases where there are no explicitly foreign key link\relationships and to induce more interesting rules from the RVER model dis covered from multiple databases by cooperatively using in ductive and abductive reasoning References I Agnwal R et al 221.Fast Discoveryof Association Rules\224 Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  1996\307-328 2 Bhattacharyya G.K and Johnson R.A Statistical Concepts and Methods John Wiley  Sons 1977 3 Freitas A.A 223On Objective Measures of Rule Surprisingness\224 J Zytkow and M Quafafou eds Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery LNAl 1510 Springer 1998 1-9 4 Goodman I.R Nguyen H.T and Walker E.A Conditional Inference and Logic,for Intelligent Systems North-Holland 1991 5 Hilderman R.J Mining Summaries from Databases using Domain Generalizativn Graphs and Objective Measures of Interestingness Ph.D. thesis, University of Regina 2000 Hilderman R.J and Hamilton H.J 223Evaluation of Interestingness Measures for Ranking Discovered Knowledge\224 D Cheung G.J Williams Q.

6 Conclusions We presented MAFIA an algorithm for finding maximal frequent itemsets Our experimental results demonstrate that MAFIA consistently outperforms Depthproject by a factor of three to five on average The breakdown of the algorithmic components showed parent-equivalence pruning and dynamic reordering were quite beneficial in reducing the search space while relative compressiodprojection of the vertical bitmaps dramatically cuts the cost of counting supports of itemsets and increases the vertical scalability of MAFIA Acknowledgements We thank Ramesh Agarwal and Charu Aggarwal for discussing Depthproject and giving us advise on its implementation We also thank Jayant R Haritsa for his insightful comments on the MAFIA algorithm and Jiawei Han for providing us the executable of the FP-Tree algorithm This research was partly supported by an IBM Faculty Development Award and by a grant from Microsoft Research References I R Agarwal C Aggarwal and V V V Prasad A Tree Projection Algorithm for Generation of Frequent Itemsets Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing special issue on high performance data mining to appear 2000 2 R Agrawal T Imielinski and R Srikant Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases SIGMOD May 1993  R Agrawal R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc of the 20th Int Conference on Very Large Databases Santiago Chile, Sept 1994  R Agrawal H Mannila R Srikant H Toivonen and A 1 Verkamo Fast Discovery of Association Rules Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Chapter 12 AAAVMIT Press 1995 5 C C Aggarwal P S Yu Mining Large Itemsets for Association Rules Data Engineering Bulletin 21 1 23-31 1 998 6 C C Aggarwal P S Yu Online Generation of Association Rules.
