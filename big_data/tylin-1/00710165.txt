Statistical Approach to Track-to-Track Association Problem ABSTRACT A Pinsky Avionic Systems Engineering Lahav Division Israel Ahrafi Industries Ltd arrinsh  hotmail.com We have applied techniques developed in I to samples of track measurements slnd have obtained decision rule that ahe asymptotidly close to decision rule characteristics probWty of false objects generation is not greater than any given significance level and possibdity to omit exist ing 
objects daasa with increase of observation time The recursive computatian algorithm that implmm ttEe above decision rnIe is developed and objects location ex timates are also obtained at every time step I INTRODUCTION In 111 Sensor Fusion SF problem of instantaneous measuremeam received from multiple independent sensors is developed This decision de assures that the probabi1 ity of fake object generation is not higher 
than any given significance level, while possibility to omit existing objects decreases when mort precise measurements are available More precise instantaneous measurements can be obtained only when sensor-to-object distance decreases However when tracks are avaiblble similar effect can be achieved by statistical average of measurements of their non-variable parameters In this paper invariability of track sources is regarded as such parameter The purpose of this research is to propose an algo 
rithm that extends decision rule for instantaneous meas urements to sequences of track measurements and to ob tain their consistency conditions. This algorithm has been developed in recursive form namely every current deci sion is based on the previous one In the second section the general track-to-track asso ciation problem is formulated as the classic statistid analysis problem In the third section an example of two track associa tion is presented In the forth section the main statement 
of the desired decision rule and object location estimates are given The algorithm implementing this decision de is pre sented in section 5 2 SF PROBLEM FORMULATION Tracks received from II independent sensors can be represented as independent sequences of measumnents af some mving object locations These independent se quences of measurements are denoted by 2 k i=Z  n Every measurement received at the k time k

The most significant subset of rules is finally selected by applying the database coverage The algorithm for building this set of rules is described below Algorithm Pruning the set of association rules Input The set of association rules that were found in the association rule mining phase S and the training text col lection D Output A set of rules used in the classification process Method sort the rules according to Definition 1 foreach rule in the set S find all those rules that are more specific according to Definition 2 prune those that have lower confidence a new set of rules S\222 is generated foreach rule R in the set S\222 go over D and find those transactions that are covered by the rule R if R classifies correctly at least one transaction remove those cases that were covered by R select R 3.4 Prediction of Classes Associated with New Documents The set of rules that were selected after the pruning phase represent the actual classifier This categorizer will be used to predict to which classes new documents are attached Given a new document, the classification process searches in this set of rules for finding those classes that are the clos est to be attached with the document presented for cate gorization This subsection discusses the approach for la belling new documents based on the set of association rules that forms the classifier A trivial solution would be to attach to the new document the class that has the most rules matching this new docu ment or the class associated with the first rule that apply to the new object. However in the text categorization domain multi-class categorization is an important and challenging problem that needs to be solved. In our approach we give a solution to this problem by introducing the dominance fac tor By employing this variable we allow our system to as sign more than one category The dominance factor 6 is the proportion of rules of the most dominant category in the applicable rules for a document to classify Given a docu ment to classify, the terms in the document would yield a list of applicable rules If the applicable rules are grouped by category in their consequent part and the groups are or dered by the sum of rules\222 confidences the ordered groups would indicate the most significant categories that should be attached to the document to be classified We call this order category dominance hence the dominance factor 6 The dominance factor allows us to select among the candi date categories only the most significant When 6 is set to a certain percentage a threshold is computed as the sum of rules\222 confidences for the most domina1 category times the value of the dominance facrnr Then only those categories that exceed this threshold are selected TakeKClasses\(S.6 function selects the most k significant classes in the classi fication algorithm The next algorithm describes the classification of a new document Algorithm Classification of a new object Input A new object to be classified 0 The associative classifier ARC The dominance factor 6 The confidence threshold r Output Categories attached to the new object Method 1 2 3 4 if count  1 5 6 S-Sur 7 9 elseexit 10 divide S in subsets by category 4 Sz  S 11 foreachsubset S1,S  S 12 sum the confidences of rules and divide by the number of rules in S 13 if it is single class classification 14 put the new document in the class that has the highest confidence sum 15 else multi-class classification 16 TakeKClasses\(S.6 17 s  0 set of rules that match o foreach rule r in ARC \(the sorted set of rules if T c o  count  fr.conf  r.conf keep the first rule confidence else if r.conf  fr.conf-r 8 scsur assign these k classes to the new document 23 


4 Experimental Results and Performance Study 4.1 Text Corpora In order to be able to objectively evaluate our algorithm vis-a-vis other approaches like other researchers in the field of automatic text categorization we used the Reuters-21578 text collection  151 as benchmarks. This text database is de scribed below Text collections for experiments are usually split into two parts one part for training or building the classifier and a second part for testing the effectiveness of the system There are many splits of the Reuters collection we chose to use the ModApte version This split leads to a corpus of 12,202 documents consisting of 9,603 training documents and 3,299 testing documents. There are 135 topics to which documents are assigned However, only 93 of them have more than one document in the training set and 82 of the categories have less than 100 documents 22 Obviously the performances in the categories with just a few docu ments would be very low especially for those that do not even have a document in the training set Among the doc uments there are some that have no topic assigned to them We chose to ignore such documents since no knowledge can be derived from them Finally we decided to test our clas sifiers on the ten most populated categories with the largest number of documents assigned to them in the training set Other researchers have used the same strategy  171 which constrained us to do the same for the sake of comparison By retaining only the ten most populated categories we have 6488 training documents and 2545 testing documents On these documents we performed stopword elimination but no stemming 4.2 Experimental Results On this data set we tested our classification system ARC BC on a Pentium 111 700MHz dual processor machine run ning Linux Several measurements have been used in previ ous studies for evaluation. Some measures as well as those used in our evaluation, can be defined in terms of precision and recall The formulae for precision and recall are given below R   and P  5 The terms used to express precision and recall are given in the contingency table Table 2 For evaluating the effectiveness of our system we used the breakeven points The breakeven point is the point at which precision equals recall and it is obtained as reported in 4 When dealing with multiple classes there are two pos sible ways of averaging these measures namely macro average and micro-average In the macro-averaging one Category col classifier Yes assignments No human assignments Yes I NO a I b c 1 d Table 2 Contingency table for category car HEY Xlthl pN"1"I rn m d*.L upli"i WW px I h=l,l is VI 111 U I O U I Xlh xn XI Xl I XI e Xlll i  70J hX1 so 7"s nl 781 VI I i I 111  72 in 114 U Table 4 the results for the other classification systems are reported as given in 9 shows a comparison between our ARC-BC classifier and other well-known methods The measures used are precisiodrecall-breakeven point, micro average and macro-average on ten most populated Reuters categories. Our system proves to perform well as compared to the other methods It outperforms most of the conven tional methods but it does not perform better than SVM In addition to these results our system has two more features First it is very fast in both training and testing phases see Table 6 The times reported are for all training and testing documents Second it produces readable and understand able rules that can be easily modified by humans \(see Table I Table 5 reports the improvements in the response of the system when human tuning was applied The support wds set to 20 which made corn and wheat categories to per form very poor By reading the rules we noticed that by adding 4 more rules for each of these categories the perfor 24

One major ad vantage of the association rule-based classifier is its rela tively fast training time Moreover the rules generated are understandable and can easily be manually updated or ad justed if necessary The maintenance of the classifier is straight forward In the case of ARC-BC when new doc uments are presented for retraining only the concerned cat egories are adjusted and the rules could be incrementally updated The introduction of the dominance factor 6 allowed multi-class categorization However other feature selection techniques such as latent semantic analysis could improve the results by giving an insight on the discriminative fea ture among classes We are working on reducing the num ber of features thus better discrimination among classes is expected Currently the discovered rules consider the pres ence of terms in documents to categorize We are studying possibilities to take into account the absence of terms in the classification rules as well Table 4 PrecisionlRecall-breakeven point on ten most populated Reuters categories for ARC-BC and 25

8.2  Effects of minimum confidence The next experiment \(Figure 6\ws the effect of varying minconf while fixing minimp and minsup to very low values. With connect-4, we used a minimum coverage of 1%, and with pums, a minimum coverage of 5%. Minimp was set to .0002 with both data-sets. As can be extrapolated from the previous figures, the number of rules meeting these weak minimp and minsup constraints would be enormous As a result, with these constraints alone, Dense-Miner exceeds the available memory of our machine The efficiency of Dense-Miner when minimum confidence is specified shows that it is effectively exploiting the confidence constraint to prune the set of rules explored. We were unable to use lower settings of minconf than those plotted because of the large number of rules. As minconf is increased beyond the point at which fewer than 100,000 rules are returned, the run-time of Dense-Miner rapidly falls to around 500 seconds on both data-sets 8.3  Summary of experimental findings These experiments demonstrate that Dense-Miner, in contrast to approaches based on finding frequent itemsets achieves good performance on highly dense data even when the input constraints are set conservatively. Minsup can be set low \(which is necessary to find high confidence rules as can minimp and minconf \(if it is set at all\This characteristic of our algorithm is important for the end-user who may not know how to set these parameters properly. Low default values can be automatically specified by the system so that all potentially useful rules are produced. Refinements of the default settings can then be made by the user to tailor this result. In general, the execution time required by Dense-Miner correlates strongly with the number of rules that satisfy all of the specified constraints 9.     Conclusions We have shown how Dense-Miner exploits rule constraints to efficiently mine consequent-constrained rules from large and dense data-sets, even at low supports. Unlike previous approaches, Dense-Miner exploits constraints such as minimum confidence \(or alternatively, minimum lift or conviction\ and a new constraint called minimum improvement during the mining phase. The minimum improvement constraint prunes any rule that does not offer a significant predictive advantage over its proper sub-rules. This increases efficiency of the algorithm, but more importantly it presents the user with a concise set of predictive rules that are easy to comprehend because every condition of each rule strongly contributes to its predictive ability The primary contribution of Dense-Miner with respect to its implementation is its search-space pruning strategy which consists of the three critical components: \(1\functions that allow the algorithm to flexibly compute bounds on confidence, improvement, and support of any rule derivable from a given node in the search tree; \(2\proaches for reusing support information gathered during previous database passes within these functions to allow pruning of nodes before they are processed; and \(3\ item-ordering heuristic that ensures there are plenty of pruning opportunities. In principle, these ideas can be retargeted to exploit other constraints in place of or in addition to those already described We lastly described a rule post-processor that DenseMiner uses to fully enforce the minimum improvement constraint. This post-processor is useful on its own for determining the improvement value of every rule in an arbitrary set of rules, as well as associating with each rule its proper sub-rule with the highest confidence. Improvement can then be used to rank the rules, and the sub-rules used to potentially simplify, generalize, and improve the predictive ability of the original rule set References 1 w a l  R.; Im ie lin ski  T   a n d S w a m i, A. 1 9 9 3   M i n i ng As so ciations between Sets of Items in Massive Databases.

The data flows in continuously and is processed daily Mining association rules dynamically has the following benefits 267  223Real-time\224 data mining, that is, the rules are drawn from the latest transactions for reflecting the current commercial trends 267  Multilevel knowledge abstraction, which requires summarizing multiple partial results. For example association rules on the month or year basis cannot be concluded from daily mining results. In fact multilevel mining is incremental in nature 267  For scalability, incremental and distributed mining has become a practical choice Figure 3: Distributed rule mining Incremental association rule mining requires combining partial results. It is easy to see that the confidence and support of multiple rules may not be combined directly. This is why we treat them as \223views\224 and only maintain the association cube, the population cube and the base cube that can be updated from each new copy of volume cube. Below, we discuss several cases to show how a GDOS can mine association rules by incorporating the partial results computed at LDOSs 267  The first case is to sum up volume-cubes generated at multiple LDOSs. Let C v,i be the volume-cube generated at LDOS i The volume-cube generated at the GDOS by combining the volume-cubes fed from these LDOSs is 345   n i i v v C C 1  The association rules are then generated at the GDOS from the centralized C v  214  The second case is to mine local rules with distinct bases at participating LDOSs, resulting in a local association cube C a,I a local population cube C p,I  and a local base cube C b,i at each LDOS. At the GDOS, multiple association cubes, population cubes and base cubes sent from the LDOSs are simply combined, resulting in a summarized association cube and a summarized population cube, as 345   n i i a a C C 1   345   n i i p p C C 1  and 345   n i i b b C C 1  The corresponding confidence cube and support cube can then be derived as described earlier. Cross-sale association rules generated from distinct customers belong to this case In general, it is inappropriate to directly combine association cubes that cover areas a 1 205, a k to cover a larger area a In the given example, this is because association cubes record counts of customers that satisfy   customer product merchant time area Doe TV Dept Store 98Q1 California Doe VCR Dept Store 98Q1 California customer product merchant time area Doe VCR Sears 5-Feb-98 San Francisco Joe PC OfficeMax 7-Feb-98 San Francisco customer product merchant time area Doe TV Fry's 3-Jan-98 San Jose Smith Radio Kmart 14-Jan-98 San Jose Association   population      base          confidence      support cube               cube                cube         cube                cube LDOS LDOS GDOS 


the association condition, and the sets of customers contained in a 1 205, a k are not mutually disjoint. This can be seen in the following examples 214  A customer who bought A and B in both San Jose and San Francisco which are covered by different LDOSs , contributes a count to the rule covering each city, but has only one count, not two, for the rule A  336  B covering California 214  A customer \(e.g. Doe in Figure 3\who bought a TV in San Jose, but a VCR in San Francisco, is not countable for the cross-sale association rule TV  336 VCR covering any of these cities, but countable for the rule covering California. This is illustrated in Figure 3 6  Conclusions In order to scale-up association rule mining in ecommerce, we have developed a distributed and cooperative data-warehouse/OLAP infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to generate association rules with enhanced expressive power, by combining information of discrete commercial activities from different geographic areas, different merchants and over different time periods. In this paper we have introduced scoped association rules  association rules with conjoint items and functional association rules as useful extensions to association rules The proposed infrastructure has been designed and prototyped at HP Labs to support business intelligence applications in e-commerce. Our preliminary results validate the scalability and maintainability of this infrastructure, and the power of the enhanced multilevel and multidimensional association rules. In this paper we did not discuss privacy control in customer profiling However, we did address this issue in our design by incorporating support for the P3P protocol [1 i n  ou r data warehouse. We plan to integrate this framework with a commercial e-commerce system References 1  Sameet Agarwal, Rakesh Agrawal, Prasad Deshpande Ashish Gupta, Jeffrey F.
