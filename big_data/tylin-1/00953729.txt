Mining Association Algorithm with Improved Threshold Based on ROC Analysis Minoru Kawahara Data Processing Center Kyoto University Kyoto 6068501 Japan kawahara@ kudpckyoto-u.ac.jp Abstract The mining association algorithm is one of the most popular data mining algorithms to derive association rules at high speed from huge databases We have been developing navigation sys tems for semi-structured data like as Web data and bibliographic data To navigate beginners our systems give the association rules derived by the algorithm However the algorithm tends to derive those rules that contain noises such as stopwords then many systems use noise 
filters to remove such noises In order to remove the noises automatically and derive more effective rules we proposed an algorithm using the true positive rate and the false positive rate of derived rules in a database based on the ROC analysis In this paper we make corrections in the parameters to improve the extended mining association algorithm Moreover we evaluate the pe~ormance of our proposed algorithm using a experimental database and show how our proposed algorithm can derive eflective association rules We also show that our proposed algorithms can remove stopwords automatically 
from raw data 1 Introduction In the research fields of data mining and text mining, various algorithms have been proposed to discover interesting patterns rules, trends and representations in various databases Many algo rithms can derive just quite simple patterns or rules as knowledge so it is very hard to derive meaningful rules or knowledge in the viewpoints of human experts However even these simple pat terns or rules may be helpful for beginners who don\222t have much background or domain knowledge of the interesting topics Focusing on the basic algorithm of association rules[l we have been developing navigation systems for semi-structured data like as Web data 
and bibliography data Our navigation system provides associative keywords with a query to users and provides helpful functions to  However it is rather difficult for the administrator to determine system parameters such as the minimum support threshold Minsup and the minimum confi dence threshold Minconf which are used in the mining associa tion algorithm. Therefore, we proposed a method which evaluates the performance of derived rules based on the ROC Receiver Op erating Characteristic analysis[2,6 and we became to be able to specifies the optimal 0-7803-7080-5/01/$10.00 02001 IEEE 703 Hiroyuki Kawano Department of Systems Science Kyoto University Kyoto 6068501, Japan kawano 
 i.kyoto-u.ac.jp While the mining association algorithm tends to derive those rules that contain noises such as stopwords then many systems use noise filters to remove such noises We focused on the seman tic relationship between the true positive rate and the false posi tive rate based on the ROC analysis in a database, and imported the parameters into the algorithm as thresholds. As the results, our extended algorithm could remove the noises automatically and de rive more effective rules 5 In this paper we make corrections in the parameters to im prove the extended algorithms. Moreover we evaluate the perfor mance of our improved algorithm using a experimental database and show how our proposed algorithm can derive effective asso ciation rules We also show that our proposed algorithms 
can re move stopwords automatically from raw data In Section 2 we summarize the mining association algorithm In Section 3 we summarize the ROC analysis and the extended algorithms In Section 4 we propose a improved mining association algorithm by making corrections in the parameters In Section 5 we evalu ate the performance of our algorithm based on the experimental results from INSPEC database Finally, we make concluding re marks in Section 6 2 Mining Association Algorithm The mining association algorithm well known as 223Apriori\224 11 is one of the most popular data mining algorithms. The algorithm requires two parameters support and confidence 
to derive asso ciation rules Given a set of transactions, where each transaction is a set of items an association rule is represented by an expression X Y where X and Y are sets of items and X n Y  8 The intuitive meaning of such a rule is that transactions in the database which contain the items in X tend to also contain the items in Y The support of the rule X  Y is the percentage of transactions that contain both X and Y hence p\(XU Y And the confidence of the rule 
X  Y is the percentage of transactions that contain Y in transactions which contain X hencep\(Y I X Adapting this algorithm to a database which contains semi structured data we adjust keyword to item and adjust tuple to transaction in the database And we adjust a set of keywords Q given in a query to X a set of keywords IC derived from Q to Y And it is assumed that B is a set of tuples which contain  U is the set of all tuples in the database and C is a set of tuples which 


contain both Q and K in the database Then the support and the con f itience of K are given by IC1 IC1 IUI 1131 SuppoTt\(K   confidence\(K   1 If X holds both support\(K not less than Minsup and con f idence\(K not less than Mincon f then K is stored into a set of keyword sets R as an association rule enough to cause de mands Where Minsup is the minimum threshold of support to judge whether K holds enough retrieval needs, and Mincon f is the minimum threshold of confidence to judge whether K holds enough confidence. Hence R  XI IC2  Ki  IC 3 Extended Mining Association Algorithm In the ROC analysis it is assumed that a instance can be classi fied into two instance classes of the positive P or the negative N and positive y or negative n are assigned by a classifier. Then the true positive rate TP and the false positive rate FP of a classifier are represented by 2  3 Plotting FP on the X axis and TP on the Y axis on a graph for several instances, we can draw monotone curves, which is called as ROC graph And the ROC curve near the area of higher TP and lower FP that is the most upper left point, must be better In order to apply the ROC analysis on semi-structured data, it is assumed that R is the set of tuples which contain ICi in the database and we defined the following in a retrieval, the posi tive instance is those 17 that decreases the number of contained tuples and the negative instance is those B that increases the num ber of them Thus the true positive instance can be defined as  17 fl U R and the false positive instance can be defined as Z n LJY=l 7G  where U is the set operator of union and 11 is the set operator to count the number of items Then TP and FP can be given by positive correctly classified TP  P\(Y I P positives  FP  p I 2 totalnegatives negative incorrectly classified And ROC curves can be illustrated by plots of points FP TP using different Minsup or Mincon f values as the classifier Focusing on TP and FP for each rule ICi where they are provicled by the equations it is found that TP is equivalent parameter to confidence used in the mining association algorithm thus the rules must be plotted on the upper area of the threshold line TP  Minconf on the ROC graph While FP is never used in the mining association algorithm, even though FP is effective parameter in the ROC i FPThreshold I I 0 0.5 1 False Positive rate Figure 1 Association rules cutoff by F P and ROC distance threshold analysis If some thresholds are given to make use of FP in the mining association algorithm it is thought that there is some pos sibility of deriving more effective rules Therefore we proposed two parameters for FP as the One is a maximum threshold of FP A rule which holds higher value of FP has stronger heterogeneousness and then it is rarely associative with the query even when the rule holds high value of TP Because those rules that appear frequently in the re trieval space tend to become  Hence the rules which hold value of FP more than the maximum threshold MazFP should be removed as shown in Figure 1 and the algorithm based on FP is summarized by the following steps FP Algorithm 1 Derive rules by the mining association algorithm 2 Select rules which hold values of FP not more than Another parameter is a minimum threshold of ROC distance which is represented by dhoc in this paper dk is the dis tance between a point FP TP and the point 1,O on the ROC graph and given by d  JTPI2 I 1.0  FP 6 Since d can evaluate the performance of derived the rule which holds the higher value of dkOc is expected to keep the higher performance Hence the rules which hold value of d less than the minimum threshold MinROC should be removed as shown in Figure 1 and the algorithm based on d is sum marized by the following steps ROC Algorithm MaxFP from the rules 1 Derive rules by the mining association algorithm 2 Select rules which hold values of dk not less than MinROC from the rules 704 


Table 1 Association rules derived from a keyword U 0 0.5 1 False Positive rate Figure 2 Association rules cutoff by improved ROC distance threshold 4 Improved Mining Association Algorithm Focusing on the semantic property of a position FP\221 TP\221 on the ROC graph, a rule positioned nearer to the upper line TP  1 covers the same space as the query for instance they may appear in an idiom. While a rule positioned nearer to the most right line FP  1 covers the different space from the query in the retrieval for instance it may be used in a domain different from that of the query. Then it is needed to make corrections in the parameters in order to make the influence of them stronger Thus we make corrections in TP\222 and FP\221 for the ROC Algo rithm as shown in Figure 2 by the following equations in order to make the influence of FP\221 stronger because FP\221 tends to become too small in a huge database ROC distance d is calculated by the equation 6 using TP\223 and FP\224 instead of TP\222 and FP\222 respectively And our Improved ROC Algorithm can be given by applying d\222 on the ROC Algorithm instead of dk 5 Performance Evaluation In order to evaluate the performance of the Improved ROC Al gorithm we have used INSPEC database, which contains 33 1,504 bibliographic titles published by INSPEC in 1998 for many queries In the database keywords are represented by the regu lar expression a-zA-ZO-9 and all of uppercase letters are mapped into lowercase letters in the index searches so that case sensitivity is ignored 223knowledae\224 fc   Order I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 IO   Then w 223 T P\222 of for and a based the in system systems to derived each alaorithm 223 1,IFP\222 I d\222 I dgnp imaee I based I based  information mode Is modeling process neural development algorithm network as image development models process process image neural models ssociation rules from sufficient number of those keywords which appeared in the attribute Title on the database Table 1 shows an example of association rules, which are associative keywords derived from a keyword 223knowledge\223 and each column is sorted in order of TP\221\(cor1 f idence 1/FP\221 dkOc and dgoc As shown in Table 1 the original algorithm FP\222 tends to de rive those meaningless words which are prepositions or have little semantic content, for example 223of\224 223for\224 and \223and\224 Such word is called as stopword[7 Since stopwords appear in many doc uments and are thus not helpful for retrieval it is required that these terms are removed from the internal model of a document or query Some systems have a predetermined list of stopwords SMART[7 system which is one of the first and still best IR sys tems available, has a list of 570 stopwords However stopwords could depend on context For example the word 223system\224 would probably be a stopword in a collection of computer science journal articles but not in a collection of articles from the Web Using the stopwords list we would evaluate how our algo rithms are effective to derive association rules In Table I key words in italics are stopwords listed in SMART system and it is found that all of our algorithms suppress to derive stopwords Hence if appropriate thresholds are given for our algorithms and lower ranked keywords are removed, stopwords will be removed automatically and the derived rules will contain little stopwords The difference between the ROC Algorithm and the Im proved ROC Algorithm in Table 1 is only that the former de rives \223network\224 which has FP\222 TP\221  0.014236,0.019164 while the latter derives 223approach\224 which has FP\222,TP\221  0.016906,0.060105 Generally speaking if keywords hold about the same values of FP\222 the keyword which holds larger value of TP\221 should be selected Therefore the latter algorithm can derive more effective rules than the former algorithm In order to evaluate properties of the Improved ROC Algo rithm we examined results derived from sufficient number of queries which contain keywords appeared in attribute Title We sampled randomly about 1 of keywords which appear not less than IO times in Title except for stopwords and selected 197 key words as queries Minsup and Mincon f are given by Minsup  0.000001 Mincon f  0.01 8 But stopwords in the derived keywords are not removed and the derived keywords are just sorted in order for each parameter then  705

The main advantage of using both Rescher-Gaines implication and the universal quantifier is that the cardinality of the set of rules remains limited a rule is discarded as soon as it is violated by a tuple In the case of a multivalued implication there is no such notion of violation unless a satisfaction threshold attached to the validity degrees of the rules is used The situation is even worse when a fuzzy quantifier is used instead of the universal one because then a threshold cannot be applied to the rules before the scan of the relation is complete. As a matter of fact, no rule can be discarded before all the tuples have been accessed, unless it is possible to find some heuristics allowing to conclude that the truth degree of a proposition such as Q X B are A where Q denotes a fuzzy quantifier X denotes a set of tuples and A and B denote fuzzy predicates cannot be greater than a given threshold as soon as a sufficient number of sufficiently bad tuples have been accessed This question should be studied in future works Let us also notice that as for the rules based on cardinalities, an altemative solution would be to build a matrix of satisfaction degrees one row for each tuple and to compute first the frequent set of labels as it is done in the nonfuzzy case but this would necessitate to i introduce a threshold on the cardinalities attached to the antecedent parts of the rules, ii find some efficient pruning criteria analogous to those used in a nonfuzzy context 4.2 Informativeness of the Rules A difficulty stems from the definition of an implica tion which is true even if the antecedent is false In other words, a rule can be valid only because no tuple of the relation fulfills its condition Two criteria seem particularly important to evaluate the informativeness of a rule The first one concerns the amount of tuples which support this rule i.e the tuples which more or less fulfill the condition part of this rule Rules which are supported by only a very small amount of tuples can be considered as rules modeling exceptional or unusual situations  The second criterion concems the level of support as sociated to a given rule. Actually, the number of tuples which support each rule is not a sufficient information Indeed, a rule can be supported by a large amount of tuples but their membership degrees to the condition part of this rule can be rather low which means that there is no ypicaf tuple for this rule in the database In conclusion the informativeness of a rule can be measured by both the number of tuples which support the rule and their degree of support This twofold information can be encoded by means of i a fuzzy cardinality or ii a histogram representing the number of tuples included in each a-cut of the condition part of the rule. Then, an expert can use this histogram or the corresponding fuzzy cardinality to determine the interest of each of the produced rules This can be done as an interactive post-processing added to the mining algorithm Further studies of the notion of informativeness could lead to an automated processing The selection of interesting rules could then be included in the mining algorithm itself 5 Conclusion In this paper, two hzzy extensions of the notion of an association rule have been investigated. Both are based on the use of fuzzy partitions meaninghl for the user defined on the attribute domains The first approach corresponds to a straightforward extension of the usual definition: the validity of a rule depends on the fuzzy number of tuples which support its antecedent part on the one hand, and on the fuzzy number of tuples which support both its parts on the other hand The general form of such an extended as sociation rule is a fuzzy quantified statement of the form most of the tuples which are A are also B An algorithm including two steps is described the first step performs a kind of information compression and computes the fuzzy cardinalities corresponding to the different combinations of fuzzy labels The second step uses these cardinalities in order to evaluate the validity of the different possible rules involving the considered attributes Two definitions of the validity are suggested In the second approach an extended association rule is based on a fuzzy implication and its result may be either truelfalse or in 0 I The semantics of such rules allows to represent gradual properties of the form the more X is A the more Y is B In other words they allow to express constraints on the values taken by the attribute in the conclusion part of the rule depending on the values taken by the attributes in the antecedent part The principle of a discovery algorithm is outlined in the special case where the implication used is Rescher-Gaines one Future works should address the issue of designing efficient algorithms for the discovery of rules based on multivalued implications It would also be of interest to study the extent to which the usual techniques 0-7803-7U78-3/0U$10.00 C IEEE Page 1108 


illustrated for instance by the Apriori algorithm 3 can be adapted in order to discover hzzy association rules such as those described here 6 References Press 1988 I61 D Dubois and H Prade 223Fuzzy cardinality and the modeling of imprecise quantification\224 Fuzzy Sets and Systems 16 1985 pp 199-230 D.

W ew ould lik e to highligh t here that the three observ ations w e ha v e made early in this section w ere critical in dev eloping a mo del theoretic and declarativ ec haracterization of the large item set computing pro cess as it did not dep end on pro cedural concepts suc h as candidate generation The observ ation that w e only need to generate and test the intersection no des help ed us visualize the pro cess as a sort of Cartesian pro duct of the kno wledge base with itself and compare eac h transaction tuple with the other tuples in the kno wledge base and see if they w ere unrelated b y subsetsup erset relationships Recall that suc h pairs are p oten tial con tributors to an in tersection no de The least xp oin tof the in tersection pro cess help ed b ecause w e kno w that w e ha v e computed all the meet irreducible elemen ts b y no w and no other in tersection no des exists There are sev eral w orks that ha v ein v estigated the issue of declarativ e asso ciation rule mining using SQL 7  23  19  16  11 Most of these w orks sp ecially 23  19 attempt to sim ulate apriori in SQL giving rise to a complicated and a wkw ard metho d They do not exploit the inheren t declarativ e prop erties of transaction databases as w eha v e iden tied in this pap er The inheren t pro ceduralit yoftheir prop osed expressions app ears to be a ma jor b ottlenec k While it is ob viously p ossible to dev elop op erators that hide the complexit y of these expressions the system nonetheless is a wkw ard unnatural and pro cedural whic h ma y ha v e eciency related dra wbac ks F urthermore b y sp ecifying the seman tics in pro cedural terms they compromise the query optimization asp ects of the system The reason for this loss of opp ortunit y is the fact that the pro cess has already b een co ded in to the declarativit y of SQL and th us database system m ust no w consider only lo cal optimization 8 


of the query expression without ha ving the global view of the in ten tion There is a big c hance that the enco ded pro cedure ma y not b e the b est w a y to compute the rules dep ending on the database instance F urthermore as w e understand it their prop osals require p oten tially large n um ber of name generation for relations and attributes The names that are needed are usually database dep enden t and th us p ossibly cannot b e gathered at query time An additional pro cess needs to b e completed to gather those v ariables b efore actual computations can b egin 5  9 Optimization Issues While it w as in tellectually c hallenging to dev elop a declarativ e expression for asso ciation rule mining from deductiv e databases there are sev eral op en issues with great promises for resolution In the w orst case the least xp oin tneedsto generate n 2 tuples in the rst pass alone when the database size is n  Theoretically  this can happ en only when eac h transaction in the database pro duces an in tersection no de and when they are not related b y subset-sup erset relationship In the second pass w e need to do n 4 computations and so on The question no w is can w e a v oid generating and p erhaps scanning some of these com binations as they will not lead to useful in tersections F or example the no de b 0 3 in gure 11 is redundan t A signican t dierence with apriori lik e systems is that our system generates all the item sets top do wn in the lattice without taking their candidacy as a large item set in to consideration Apriori on the other hand do es not generate an y no de if their subsets are not large item sets themselv es and thereb y prunes a large set of no des Optimization tec hniques that exploit this so called an ti-monotonicit y prop ert y of item set lattices similar to apriori could mak e all the dierence in our setup The k ey issue w ould b e ho ww e push the selection threshold minim um supp ort inside the top do wn computation of the no des in the lattice in our metho d F or the momen t and for the sak e of this discussion let us consider a higher supp ort threshold of 60 for the database T of gure 9 No w the l-en v elop e will b e the one sho wn in ligh ter dashed lines in gure 11 and the no des under this line will b e the large item sets Notice that no ww eha v eto discard no des ad 2 0 and d 0 2 to o This raises the question is it p ossible to utilize the supp ort and condence thresholds pro vided in the query and prune candidates for in tersection an y further Ideas similar to magic sets transformation 3  24 ma y be b orro w ed to address this issue The only problem is that pruning of an y no de dep ends on its supp ort coun t whic h ma y come at a later stage By then all no des ma y already ha v e b een computed and th us pushing selection conditions inside aggregate op erator ma y b ecome non-trivial Sp ecial data structures and indexes ma y also aid in dev eloping faster metho ds to compute ecien t interse ction joins that w e ha v e utilized in this pap er W e lea v e these questions as op en issues that should be tak en up in the future F ortunately though there has been a v ast b o dy of researc h in optimizing Datalog programs including recursiv e programs suc h as the one w e ha v e used in this pap er and hence the new questions and researc h 5 Recall that their prop osal requires one to express the mining problem to the system using sev eral queries and up date statemen ts that utilizes information ab out the database con ten ts to ac hiev e its functionalit y  c hallenges that this prop osal raises for declarativ e mining ma y exploit some of these adv ances Needless to emphasize a declarativ e metho d preferably a formal one is desirable b ecause once w e understand the functioning of the system w e will then be able to select appropriate pro cedures dep ending on the instances to compute the seman tics of the program whic hw e kno wis in tended once w e establish the equiv alence of declarativ e and pro cedural seman tics of the system F ortunately  w e ha v e n umerous pro cedural metho ds for computing asso ciation rules whic h complemen t eac h other in terms of sp eed and database instances In fact that is what declarativ e systems or declarativit y buy us  a c hoice for the most ecien t and accurate pro cessing p ossible 10 Conclusion Our primary goal for this pap er has b een to demonstrate that mining asso ciation rules from an y rst-order kno wledge base is p ossible in a declarativ ew a y  without help from an y sp ecial to ols or mac hinery  and that w e can no wha v ea v ery in tuitiv e and simple program to do so W eha v esho wn that it is indeed p ossible to mine declarativ ekno wledge b y exploiting the existing mac hinery supp orted b ycon temp orary inference engines in programming languages e.g Prolog or kno wledge base systems e.g RelationLog XSB LD L  CORAL All w e require is that the engine b e able to supp ort set v alued terms grouping aggregate functions and set relational op erators for comparison functionalities whic hmostofthesesystemscurren tly supp ort W e ha v e also demonstrated that our formalism is grounded on a more mathematical foundation with formal prop erties on whic h the seman tics of the R ULES system rely  W e ha v e also raised sev eral op en issues related to eciency and query optimization whic h should b e our next order of business As future researc h w e plan to dev elop optimization tec hniques for mining queries that require non-trivial lo ok ahead and pruning tec hniques in aggregate functions The dev elopmen ts presen ted here also ha v e other signican t implications F or example it is no w p ossible to compute c hi square rules 4 using the building blo c ks pro vided b y our system Declarativ e computation of c hi square rules to our kno wledge has nev er b een attempted for the man y pro cedural concepts the computation of c hi square metho d relies on In a separate w ork 2 w e sho w that the coun ting metho d prop osed in this pap er can be eectiv ely utilized to generate the exp ectations needed in order to compute suc h rules rather easily  These are some of the issues w e plan to address in the near future The motiv ation imp ortance and the need for in tegrating data mining tec hnology with relational databases has b een addressed in sev eral articles suc h as 12  13 They con vincingly argue that without suc h in tegration data mining tec hnology ma y not nd itself in a viable p osition in the y ears to come T o b e a successful and feasible to ol for the analysis of business data in relational databases suc htec hnology m ust b e made a v ailable as part of database engines and as part of its declarativ e query language Our prop osal for declarativ e mining bears merit since it sheds ligh t on ho w rst order databases can be mined in a declarativ e and pro cedure indep enden t w a y so that the optimization issues can b e delegated to the underlying database engine Once suc h argumen ts are accepted sev eral systems 9 


related issues b ecome prime candidates for immediate atten tion F or example traditionally database systems supp orted declarativ e querying without the necessit y to care ab out the pro ceduralit y of the queries In this pap er w eha v e actually demonstrated that asso ciation rule mining can b e view ed as a Datalog query  It is immediate that a direct mapping from the Datalog expressions presen ted in this pap er to SQL can be dev elop ed with no problem at all W e can then rely on ecien t database pro cessing of the query in an optimized fashion Hence w ecomeclose to the essence of the visions expressed b y the leading database researc hers and practioners 12  References 1 Rak esh Agra w al and Ramakrishnan Srik an t F ast algorithms for mining asso ciation rules in large databases In VLDB  pages 487{499 1994 2 Anon ymous A declarativ e metho d for mining c hisquare rules from deductiv e databases T ec hnical rep ort Departmen t of Computer Science Anon ymous Univ ersit y USA F ebruary 2001 3 C Beeri and R Ramakrishnan On the po w er of magic In Pr o c e e dings of the 6th A CM Symp osium on Principles of Datab ase Systems  pages 269{283 1987 4 Sergey Brin Ra jeev Mot w ani and Craig Silv erstein Bey ond mark et bask ets Generalizing asso ciation rules to correlations In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 265 276 1997 5 D Chimen ti et al The LD L system protot yp e IEEE Journal on Data and Know le dge Engine ering  2\(1 90 1990 6 Jia w ei Han Jian P ei and Yiw en Yin Mining frequen t patterns without candidate generation In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 1{12 2000 7 Marcel Holsheimer Martin L Kersten Heikki Mannila and Hann uT oiv onen A p ersp ectiv e on databases and data mining In Pr o c of the sixth A CM SIGKDD Intl Conf  pages 150{155 Mon treal Queb ec 1995 8 Flip Korn Alexandros Labrinidis Y annis Kotidis and Christos F aloutsos Ratio rules A new paradigm for fast quan tiable data mining In Pr o c of 24th VLDB  pages 582{593 1998 9 Brian Len t Arun N Sw ami and Jennifer Widom Clustering asso ciation rules In Pr o c of the 3th ICDE  pages 220{231 1997 10 Mengc hi Liu Relationlog At yp ed extension to datalog with sets and tuples In John Llo yd editor Pr oc e e dings of the 12th International L o gic Pr o gr amming Symp osium  pages 83{97 P ortland Oregon Decem ber 1995 MIT Press 11 Rosa Meo Giusepp e Psaila and Stefano Ceri An extension to SQL for mining asso ciation rules Data Mining and Know le dge Disc overy  2\(2 1998 12 Amir Netz Sura jit Chaudh uri Je Bernhardt and Usama M F a yy ad In tegration of data mining with database tec hnology  In Pr o c e e dings of 26th VLDB  pages 719{722 2000 13 Amir Netz Sura jit Chaudh uri Usama M F a yy ad and Je Bernhardt In tegrating data mining with SQL databases In IEEE ICDE  2001 14 Ra ymond T Ng Laks V S Lakshmanan Jia w ei Han and Alex P ang Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained asso ciation rules In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 13{24 1998 15 Jong So o P ark Ming-Sy an Chen and Philip S Y u An eectiv e hash based algorithm for mining asso ciation rules In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 175{186 1995 16 Karthic k Ra jamani Alan Co x Bala Iy er and A tul Chadha Ecien t mining for asso ciation rules with relational database systems In Pr o c e e dings of the International Datab ase Engine ering and Applic ations Symp osium  pages 148{155 1999 17 R Ramakrishnan D Sriv asta v a and S Sudarshan CORAL  Con trol Relations and Logic In Pr o c of 18th VLDB Confer enc e  pages 238{250 1992 18 Konstan tinos F Sagonas T errance Swift and Da vid Scott W arren XSB as an ecien t deductiv e database engine In Pr o c of the A CM SIGMOD Intl Conf  pages 442{453 1994 19 Sunita Sara w agi Shib y Thomas and Rak esh Agra w al In tegrating mining with relational database systems Alternativ es and implications In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 343{354 1998 20 Ashok a Sa v asere Edw ard Omiecinski and Shamk an tB Nav athe An ecien t algorithm for mining asso ciation rules in large databases In Pr o c of 21th VLDB  pages 432{444 1995 21 Pradeep Sheno y  Ja y an t R Haritsa S Sudarshan Gaura v Bhalotia Ma y ank Ba w a and Dev a vrat Shah T urb o-c harging v ertical mining of large databases In A CM SIGMOD  pages 22{33 2000 22 Abraham Silb ersc hatz Henry F Korth and S Sudarshan Datab ase System Conc epts  McGra w-Hill third edition 1996 23 Shib y Thomas and Sunita Sara w agi Mining generalized asso ciation rules and sequen tial patterns using SQL queries In KDD  pages 344{348 1998 24 J D Ullman Principles of Datab ase and Know le dgeb ase Systems Part I II  Computer Science Press 1988 25 Mohammed J Zaki Generating non-redundan t association rules In Pr o c of the 6th A CM SIGKDD Intl Conf  Boston MA August 2000 1 0
