FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES FOR HANDLING CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES Hisao Ishibuchi, Tomoharu Nakashima and Takashi Yamamoto Department of Industrial Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Japan  hisaoi nakashi, yama} @ie.osakafu-u.ac.jp ABSTRACT Association rules are frequently used for describing association i.e co-occurrence among attribute values in the field of data mining When an attribute is continuous i.e real-valued such as height length and weight its domain is usually discretized into several intervals. Fuzzy rules are recognized as a convenient tool for handling continuous attributes in a human understandable manner When we use fuzzy rules 
the domain of each continuous attribute is discretized into several fuzzy sets. A linguistic label is usually associated with each fuzzy set especially when linguistic interpretations of fuzzy rules are required In this paper we first fuzzify the concept of association rules That is we show fuzzy versions of two measures i.e confidence and support that are used for evaluating each association rule in the field of data mining. Then we illustrate these two measures of fuzzy rules for function approximation and pattem classification problems Finally we examine the relation between the classification performance 
of fuzzy rules and the definition of their certainty grades through computer simulations. Simulation results show that the direct use of confidence as a certainty grade is not always appropriate from the viewpoint of classification performance 1 INTRODUCTION In the use of association rules l the domain of a continuous attribute is usually discretized into several intervals As a result such an attribute is handled as a discrete attribute Fuzzy rules which can be viewed as a kind of association rules are recognized as a convenient tool for handling continuous 
attributes in a human understandable manner When we use fuzzy rules the domain of a continuous attribute is discretized into several fuzzy sets A linguistic label e.g small medium and large is usually associated with each fuzzy set especially when linguistic interpretations of fuzzy rules are required 0-7803-7090-2/01/$10.00 0 2001 IEEE  118 In this paper we first fuzzify the concept of association rules by extending the definitions of two measures i.e confidence and support to the case of fuzzy rules The 
number of samples i.e cases in the original definitions is replaced with the sum of compatibility grades in the case of fuzzy rules Our definitions are reduced to the original definitions when compatibility grades are non fuzzy i.e 0 or 1 Then we illustrate these two measures of fuzzy rules for function approximation and pattem classification problems Finally we examine the relation between the classification performance of fuzzy rules and the definition of their certainty grades through computer simulations on a real-world pattem classification problem Simulation results show that the direct 
use of confidence as a certainty grade is not always appropriate from the viewpoint of classification performance of fuzzy rules 2 FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES 2.1 Basic Definitions Let us assume that we have m cases XI x2  x each of which is described by n continuous attributes a1  a2   a as xp  xpl,xp2  xpn where xpi is an attribute value

intervals given for each attribute Let D\(Iik be the set of cases whose i-th attribute values are included in the k-th interval Iik for the i-th attribute ai  D\(Iik  xp  xpi E I p  1,2  m  1 When the domain of the i-th attribute ai is completely covered by the K disjoint intervals the following relation holds ISIE 2001 Pusan KOREA 


where 1.1 denotes the cardinality i.e the number of elements in the set Let us consider a simple association rule xi E lik a xj E IJ where x and xi are attribute values of the i-th and j-th attributes, respectively The confidence c and the support s of this rule are defined as follows  11 3 4 When the domain of each attribute is discretized into several fuzzy sets we can extend the above definitions to the case of fuzzy association rules Let us assume that K fuzzy sets Fil  42   are given for each attribute ai In this case, fuzzy subsets of D can be defined based on the K fuzzy sets given for each attribute Let D\(4k be the fuzzy set of cases whose i-th attribute values are included in the k-th fuzzy set k for the i-th attribute ai  where p  is the membership function of Ck  As a natural extension of 3 and 4 the confidence c and the support s of the fuzzy associahon rule x E F x E FJh are defined as 7 In these definitions the cardinality of a fuzzy set is defined by the sum of membership values as and the intersection of two fuzzy sets is defined by the minimum operator A as D\(Fik n D\(F~h 9 l\(jl~,~\(~pi xpi P=U It is also possible to define the intersechon of two fuzzy sets by the product operator as 2.2 Function Approximation Problems Conventional fuzzy rules for approximation problems of n-input and single-output functions are written as Rule R  If x is A and  and x is A then y is B 1 1 where q is a rule index A is an antecedent fuzzy set and B is a consequent fuzzy set This fuzzy rule shows the association between the fuzzy input subspace A  A x  x A and the fuzzy output subspace B  Let us assume that we have m input-output pairs x y  p=1,2  m where x is an n-dimensional input vector i.e x xpl  x  and y is the corresponding output value In this case the data set D consists of the m input-output pairs In the same manner as in the previous subsection the confidence c and the support s of the fuzzy rule in 1 1 are defined as ID\(AqI n  n D\(Aqn n D\(B  ID\(AqI I n  n D\(Aqn  ID\(A  n  n D\(Aqn n w  ID1 C\(A  B   12 s\(Aq 2 B  9 13 where D\(A and D\(B are defined in the same manner as 9 and the intersection of multiple fuzzy sets is defined by the minimum operator or the product operator as in 9  10 2.3 Pattern Classification Problems Conventional fuzzy rules for n-dimensional pattern classification problems can be written as Rule R  If x1 is A,1 and  and x is A then Class C  14 where C is a non-fuzzy class label This fuzzy rule shows the association between the fuzzy input subspace A x  x A and the class C  Let us assume that we have m labeled pattems x  xpl  x p  1,2  m  That is, a class label is associated with each of the m patterns The data set D consists of the m labeled pattems In the same manner as 119 ISIE 2001 Pusan KOREA

Besides we observed that the GST algorithm is less sensitive to the variance of the minimum support under the environments of more data, such as C10.T10.D6000 and C10.T5.D6000. Finally, we also found that the curves of all three algorithms become smooth for the lower minimum support under the environments of less data, such as C10.T2.D6000 and C5.T5.D6000. The reason is that the number of generated candidate sequences is always not beyond some threshold  0 2000 4000 6000 8000 15 12.5 0 5 5 minimum support ex ecu t i o n t i m e   s ec o n d  Apriori DSG GST Figure 7.\(a\ The environment C10.T10.D6000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 15 12.5 10 7.5 5 minimum support ex ec u t i o n t i m e  s e c o n d  Apriori DSG GST Figure 7.\(b\ The environment C10.T5.D6000 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 15 12.5 0 7.5 5 minimum support execution time \(second Apriori DSG GST Figure 7.\(c\ The environment C10.T2.D6000 0 500 1000 1500 2000 15 12.5 10 7.5 5 minimum support ex ecu t i o n t i m e   s e c o n d  Apriori DSG GST Figure 7.\(d\ The environment C5.T5.D6000 Experiment 2 In the experiment, we explore the scalability of the GST algorithm under different simulation environments as shown in Figure 8.

Conclusions and future works In the paper, we propose the GST algorithm to find sequential patterns from a transaction database. Through the experiments, we find that the GST algorithm is superior to the Apriori-like algorithms. The advantage of the GST algorithm over the Apriori-like algorithms is th at it can 1\generate large sequences without constructing candidate sequences and 2 generate large k sequences without following from large  k-1 quences step-by-step. Besides, we consider time constraints as well when finding sequential patterns, and this makes the found sequence patterns more useful. Finally, we also propose the method to fi nd new sequential patterns by scanning only new transactions since the database was increased, and compare it with the rough method of scanning the entire database In the GST algorithm, we search the IRG to find the large sequences rooted from each node. Since some redundant paths might be generated, the GST algorithm can be tried to avoid the sub-path generation when a path is found. Besides, in the future, we shall extend our algorithm to Web usage mining to mine the Web access logs [4 ich can b e  u s ed t o  pred ict user visit patterns and then help in targeting the advertisements at groups of users based on these patterns 6.

correlations among the underlying data In its most general form an asso ciation rule can b e view ed as b eing de\014ned o v er attributes of a relation and has the form C 1  C 2  where C 1 and C 2 are conjunctions of conditions and eac h condition is either A i  v i or A i 2  l i u i  v i  l i and u i are v alues from the domain of the attribute A i  Eac h rule has an asso ciated supp ort and c

The data flows in continuously and is processed daily Mining association rules dynamically has the following benefits 267  223Real-time\224 data mining, that is, the rules are drawn from the latest transactions for reflecting the current commercial trends 267  Multilevel knowledge abstraction, which requires summarizing multiple partial results. For example association rules on the month or year basis cannot be concluded from daily mining results. In fact multilevel mining is incremental in nature 267  For scalability, incremental and distributed mining has become a practical choice Figure 3: Distributed rule mining Incremental association rule mining requires combining partial results. It is easy to see that the confidence and support of multiple rules may not be combined directly. This is why we treat them as \223views\224 and only maintain the association cube, the population cube and the base cube that can be updated from each new copy of volume cube. Below, we discuss several cases to show how a GDOS can mine association rules by incorporating the partial results computed at LDOSs 267  The first case is to sum up volume-cubes generated at multiple LDOSs. Let C v,i be the volume-cube generated at LDOS i The volume-cube generated at the GDOS by combining the volume-cubes fed from these LDOSs is 345   n i i v v C C 1  The association rules are then generated at the GDOS from the centralized C v  214  The second case is to mine local rules with distinct bases at participating LDOSs, resulting in a local association cube C a,I a local population cube C p,I  and a local base cube C b,i at each LDOS. At the GDOS, multiple association cubes, population cubes and base cubes sent from the LDOSs are simply combined, resulting in a summarized association cube and a summarized population cube, as 345   n i i a a C C 1   345   n i i p p C C 1  and 345   n i i b b C C 1  The corresponding confidence cube and support cube can then be derived as described earlier. Cross-sale association rules generated from distinct customers belong to this case In general, it is inappropriate to directly combine association cubes that cover areas a 1 205, a k to cover a larger area a In the given example, this is because association cubes record counts of customers that satisfy   customer product merchant time area Doe TV Dept Store 98Q1 California Doe VCR Dept Store 98Q1 California customer product merchant time area Doe VCR Sears 5-Feb-98 San Francisco Joe PC OfficeMax 7-Feb-98 San Francisco customer product merchant time area Doe TV Fry's 3-Jan-98 San Jose Smith Radio Kmart 14-Jan-98 San Jose Association   population      base          confidence      support cube               cube                cube         cube                cube LDOS LDOS GDOS 


the association condition, and the sets of customers contained in a 1 205, a k are not mutually disjoint. This can be seen in the following examples 214  A customer who bought A and B in both San Jose and San Francisco which are covered by different LDOSs , contributes a count to the rule covering each city, but has only one count, not two, for the rule A  336  B covering California 214  A customer \(e.g. Doe in Figure 3\who bought a TV in San Jose, but a VCR in San Francisco, is not countable for the cross-sale association rule TV  336 VCR covering any of these cities, but countable for the rule covering California. This is illustrated in Figure 3 6  Conclusions In order to scale-up association rule mining in ecommerce, we have developed a distributed and cooperative data-warehouse/OLAP infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to generate association rules with enhanced expressive power, by combining information of discrete commercial activities from different geographic areas, different merchants and over different time periods. In this paper we have introduced scoped association rules  association rules with conjoint items and functional association rules as useful extensions to association rules The proposed infrastructure has been designed and prototyped at HP Labs to support business intelligence applications in e-commerce. Our preliminary results validate the scalability and maintainability of this infrastructure, and the power of the enhanced multilevel and multidimensional association rules. In this paper we did not discuss privacy control in customer profiling However, we did address this issue in our design by incorporating support for the P3P protocol [1 i n  ou r data warehouse.

optimization for larger transaction sizes and in cases where there are large number of candidate k itemsets 6 Conclusions In this paper e presented a parallel implementation of the Apriori algorithm on the SGI Power Challenge shared memory multi-processor We also discussed a set of optimizations which include optimized join and pruning computation balancing for candidate generation hash tree balancing and short-circuited subset checking We then presented experimental results on each of these Improvements of more than 40 were obtained for the computation and hash tree balancing The short-circuiting optimization was found to be extremely effective for databases with large transaction sizes Finally we reported the parallel performance of the algorithm While we d good speed-up we observed a need for parallel I/O techniques for further performance gains References  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Database mining A performance perspecti v e  I n IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engg  pages 5\(6 1993  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in lar ge databases In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1993  R Agra wal H Mannila R Srikant H T o i v onen and A I V erkamo F ast disco v ery of association rules In U F et al editor Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  MIT Press 1996  R Agra wal and J Shafer  P arallel mining of association rules design implementation and e xperience Technical Report RJ10004 IBM Almaden Research Center San Jose CA 95120 Jan 1996  R Agra wal and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Proc 20th VLDB Conf  Sept 1994  M Cierniak W  Li and M J Zaki Loop scheduling for heterogeneity  I n 4th IEEE Intl Symposium on High-Performance Distributed Computing also as URCS-TR 540 CS Dept Univ f Rochester  Aug 1995  M Holsheimer  M  K ersten H Mannila and H T o i v onen A perspecti v e on databases and data mining In 1st Intl Conf Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  Aug 1995  M Houtsma and A Swami Set-oriented mining of association rules In RJ 9567  IBM Almaden Oct 1993  H Mannila H T o i v onen and I V erkamo Ef 336cient algorithms for disco v ering association rules In AAAI Wkshp Knowledge Discovery in Databases  July 1994  J S P ark M Chen and P  S Y u  A n e f fecti v e hash based algorithm for mining association rules In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1995 17 Proceedings of the 1996 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing \(SC\22296 0-89791-854-1/96 $ 10.00 ACM
