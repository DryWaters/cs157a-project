Proceedings of 1993 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks On some new associative properties of neural networks with an asymmetric Hebbian rule Toshinao Ishii Kazuo Kyuma Mitsubishi Electric Corp Central Research Lab Abstract Recurrent associative neural networks with a new model of connection weights which we call an asymmetric Hebbian rule are discussed By using this model we extend associative functions of neural networks Networks with the model has associative functions such as 
conditional association robustness to unmemorized patterns and cooperative association are discussed We also propose a model of multiple association modes realized by using the properties of the same model Multiple levels of hidden memories can be embedded and they are activated or deactivated by controlling threshold values I Introduction The memory fmctions of our brain which we can feel every day are surprisingly subtle and complicated Associative neural networks I are important mod els to investigate these biological memory systems however we think 
that only a small part of associa tive functions of biological memory systems has been implemented with neural network models Some of the main characteristics of recurrent as sociative neural networks we focus in this article are 1 the dynamical properties 2 distributed repre sentation of information The motivations of our report in this article are the following Concerning l we think that it is not easy for those models which have fixed point attractors as memorized pat tern to have 
dynamical properties of biological mem ory systems and concerning 2 cooperations of neu rons have been investigated and applied in most of reported researches but coooperations between mem orized patterns which can be resources of associative functions do not seem to be discussed enough We propose a new model of connection weights of recurrent neural networks One of its properties cooperative association is applied to new associa tive functions such as conditional association or pat tern sequence association are realized 
The networks with this model also have multiple association modes With their properties multiple levels of hidden mem ory configurations are embedded and their activation and inhibition are controlled which configure wan dering associative dynamics between embedded at tractors 2 Model In this section we first describe a requirement of con nection weights which is the basic assumption for the construction of our model Then we derive from it an asymmetric Hebbian rule and discuss its proper ties especially new functions such as 
embedding pat terns of various activities and cooperative associa tion 2.1 An asymmetric Hebbian rule The rule 2 is roughly described in table 1 The synaptic modulation occurs only when post-synaptic neuron fires Whether the weights are increased or descreased depends on coming signal from post synaptic neurons and the magnitudes of modulation are generally different between increase and decrease Table 1 Rough description of our Hebbian rule This model, which we call an asymmetric Hebbian 
rule is derived from the requirement that output sig nals of neurons do not depend in average on activi ties of network states If activities of network states which is one dimensional quantity is dominant to network dynamics distributed representation of in formation is no longer necessary This is the reason we have this requirement Mathematical description of it is that j holds for all a where w  wij is connection weights s  sj E 
0 l is network state a  E sj is activity of state s N is number of neurons  3 is average K is a constant and 6 is a small fluctuation Concerning the K in eq l the following calculation proves that it is equals to 0 where E is summation over patterns whose activity is a Because this average is required to be constant 413 


over various activities of s and because E  does not depend on j but on the activity of s it holds that cj wij N 0 so that K  0 It is also easily verified that the requirement of eq.\(l is equivalent to aN 3 We apply this requirement to a general form of connection weights of recurrent neural network The general form is where pk  pt,p    p is a pattern to embed and cy fi and y are constants One of the sufficient conditions for a fi and y to satisfy eq.\(3 is the fol lowing 5 cya\(pfi  p  0  Y=o With new constants T     and R  p eq 4 becomes 1 When network dynamics is defined as s\(t  1  O ws  h  where O\(x is Heaviside step function which is 1 if x 2 0 and 0 otherwise and where h is threshold it is verified that pk are fixed points of this dynamics[2 In general pattern transition from p to q is embedded by adding the following to w 7 2.2 Characteristics of the asymmetric Hebbian rule The asymmetric Hebbian rule realizes embedding patterns and retrieving them which is one of the ba sic properties of the associative memory[2 Further more there are new properties which can be applied to extend associative functions of the networks First when pattern s has small correlations to all the em bedded patterns it holds that cwijsj N 0 8 j This means that weighted sum of the receiving sig nals of all the neurons are very small In other words the dynamics of networks with this rule are robust to unmemorized patterns Second a state whose activity is large in general cannot be stable When all the neuron fires which is the extreme case of large activity the weighted sum of receiving signals become E wij Because of the requirement of eq.\(3 this value is very small and the neurons do not fire at the next time The actual up per limit of the activity depends on conditions such as threshold value which is principal or memory con figurations or normalization constants Third when p and q are memorized as fixed points of the dynamics p U q is also a fixed point where U represents boolean OR operation This was verified by calculating cj wtj pj U qj and numerical simulation There are some applications of this inter esting property of superposed patterns For example suppose fixed point p and transition p U q  r are embedded In this case the transition from q to T occurs only when p is activated because embedded transition is not p t q but from p U q This mecha nism realized a conditional association Figure 1 shows a behavior of network dynamics discussed above In this network five transition paths of patterns were embedded, among which there were three transitions that started with 2U8,4U9 and 6U10 respectively See caption for detail All of these elementary patterns were included in the other two paths The graph shows that the paths which starts with the superpositions are activated when these su perpositions were generated but not activated when only a part of the superpositions are activated These associative properties are cooperations of embedded patterns There are more possible applications such as association of sequences of patterns 2 These facts means that not only memorized patterns but also their combinations are resources of information processing in these networks 3 Multiple association modes For the study of neural network and biological mem ory the dynamical properties of networks are one of the most important subjects In human memory for example it seems that very complicated associations are executed Starting with a word or a scene or a melody we can recall various related things which is very different from memory systems in digital com puters For models of such wandering associative behavior of memory systems we propose multiple association modes of neural networks A mode of associative dy namics is a qualitative state of networks and accord 414
