algorithm is frequent itemset discovery In this paper a frequent itemset discovery algorithm based on the Hopfield model is presented 1 Introduction Data mining has recently attracted tremendous amount of attention in database research because of its applicability in many areas including decision support marketing strategy and financial forecast Data mining algorithms can be classified into three categories Association rule mining ARM clustering and classification In this paper we will concentrate on ARM The ARM problem was introduced in AIS931 and can be 
formalized as follows. Let I  h1,i2  in}be the set of n distinct items and D a set of sales transactions, where each transaction Tis a subset of I A subset of I containing k items is called a k-itemset An itemset X is said to have a support s if s of the transactions in D contain X as a subset i.e the ratio of the number of transactions 
in D containing X to the total number of transactions in D An itemset is afrequent itemset if it occurs in the database with a certain user-specified frequency, called minimum support In addition, an itemset X is maximal or large if it is not a subset of any other itemset An association rule is an expression of the form X  Y  where X and Y are 
subsets of Z and XnY  0 An association rule X  Y is said to have confidence c if c of the transactions that contain X also contain Y i.e c=support X U Y support X  An association rule X  Y has a support s if s of the transactions in D contain both X and 
Y The task of mining association rules is to find all the association rules which satisfy both the user-defined minimum support and minimum confidence The process of mining association rules can be decomposed into two steps. First, all the frequent itemsets are identified Then the association rules satisfying both the minimum support and the minimum confidence are identified based on the frequent itemsets computed in the first step In this paper we only deal with the computationally intensive first step A lot of  have pointed out that the process of generating frequent itemsets turns out 
to be the bottleneck in ARM Therefore researchers have focused on developing algorithms for the generation of frequent itemsets Finding frequent itemsets is a nontrivial problem First the number of transactions can be very large Second, the potential number of frequent itemsets is exponential in the number of different items, although the actual number of frequent itemsets can be much smaller In addition, the frequent itemset search problem can be reduced to the task of enumerating only the maximal frequent itemsets since all the other frequent itemsets are subsets of these maximal frequent itemsets Once the 
maximal frequent itemset have been identified the support of all uncounted subsets can be computed by making an additional database pass Having the support of all frequent itemsets the association rules are then generated 2 Sequential mining of association rules Given n items there are 2n subsets that might potentially be frequent An extensive search over this exponential space is infeasible except for very small values of n 90 1082-3409/00 10.00 0 2000 EEEi 


Many algorithms for finding\222 frequent itemsets have been proposed in the literature The most popular is the Apriori  and its extensions the and PARTITION Apriori is an iterative algorithm that counts itemsets of a specific length is a given database pass In the first iteration, the size-1 large itemsets are computed by scanning the database once Subsequently in the kth iteration the candidates k itemsets are generated from the set of frequent k-1 itemsets found in iteration k 1 The support counts of the candidates k-itemsets are then computed by scanning the database once The algorithm after the scan discards candidates with support lower than the user-specified minimum and retains only the frequent k-itemsets The process is repeated until all frequent itemsets have been enumerated Several refinements have been proposed in literature that focus on reducing the number of database scans, the number of candidate itemsets counted in each scan, or both Zaki presented in a survey on some of the work done in building sequential ARM algorithms with a summary of the major differences among them 3 Parallel mining of association rules Since mining frequent itemsets requires lots of computation power memory and disk YO parallel algorithms are needed Many parallel ARM have been proposed in literature for frequent itemset discovery and most of them are based on their sequential counterparts[Z99 On distributed system all the algorithm assume that the database is evenly distributed on the disks attached to the processors The different algorithms presented in the literature propose different techniques in order to optimize the synchronization and the communication costs between processors andlor to use the aggregate memory efficiently On shared memory systems, the database is logically divided into partitions and the main issue of ARM algorithms is to avoidreduce false sharing and to achieve good data locality[Z99 Zaki presented in an up-to-date survey on some of the work done in building parallel and distributed ARM algorithms for distributed or shared memory platform Techniques inspired from human being such as neural networks and genetic algorithms has been applied to mine classification rules from databases Classification which involves finding rules that partition a given data set into disjoint groups is one class of data mining problems An algorithm that extract classification rules from a trained neural network is presented in Another algorithm proposed in combines neural network genetic algorithm and symbolic learning approach to mine classification rules In this paper a frequent itemset discovery algorithm that uses a Hopfield network is presented As far as we know Hopfield model has not been used to solve the ARM problem The Hopfield network is often used in literature in modeling a neural network for combinatorial optimization problems[GTFOO The rest of the paper is organized as follows In the next section we present a brief review of the Hopfield type neural network We present then a frequent itemset discovery algorithm that uses a Hopfield network 4 Hopfield type neural network A neural network NN is a computational structure inspired by the study of biological neural processing A NN can be viewed as a directed graph wherein nodes are the artificial neurons Neurons are processing elements seen as units that are similar to the neurons in a human brain. Edges of the directed graph represent the synapses i.e connections between the neurons The neurons can be connected in arbitrary way The Hopfield type neural network is a fully interconnected system of N neurons Each neuron is modeled as a nonlinear devise \(operational amplifier with a sigmoid monotonic increasing function relating the output Vi of the ith neuron to its input state ui The frequent choice of the sigmoid function is Vi  gi \(ui   1 tanh\(hiui   Each neuron receives resistive connections to model synaptic connections, from other neurons These synaptic connections are described through a matrix T  Tij This matrix is symmetric Tv=qi Each neuron receives also an external current known also as bias Zi which could represent actual data provided by the user to the NN The evolution of the neurons is defined by the differential equation 1 2 dui N    ui  C T..V Ii dt j=1 1J J The energy function of the Hopfield analog neural network is defined by Energy function, also known as the Lyapunov function, in a neural network is a function of outputs and weights which determines the state of the system The term 223energy function\224 stems from an analogy between the network behavior and that of certain physical systems. A network of neurons will always evolve towards a minimum of the energy function like physical systems evolve toward an equilibrium state. A stable state of NN corresponds to a local minima of the energy function In terms of the energy function given by 2 the dynamics of the ith neuron are described by 


3 To map a problem onto a neural network we have to perform the following steps Choose a neuralarchitecture i.e the number of nodes which depends on the coding chosen for the solution problem Choose an energy function whose minimum value corresponds to 223best\224 solutions to the problem to be mapped Derive connectivities Tu and input bias currents Z from the energy function Set up initial values for the input voltages ui that completely determine the stable output voltages of the network neurons 5 Frequent itemset discovery with a Hopfield network Hopfield and Tank HTSS showed that if a combinatorial optimization problem can be expressed in terms of a quadratic energy function of the general form given by 2 a Hopfield network can be used to find locally optimal solutions of the energy function These may translate to local minimum solutions of the optimization problem The network energy function is made equivalent to the objective function to be minimized The constraints of the optimization problem are included in the energy function as penalty terms Let us consider the ARM formulated as follows Given a set of n transactions and p items The main computation step in an ARM algorithm is to discover frequent items It consists of enumerating the frequently occurring item sets that appear together in many transactions and satisfy the user-specified minimum support. Let bTi be a 0-1 variable to denote the fact that item i is present in transaction T bn has value 1 if the 7th transaction contains the item i and value 0 otherwise This suggests that a p-tuple is associated with each transaction with some element equal to 1 and the rest elements equal to 0 In a neural network presentation this requires p neurons for each transaction Since there are n transactions, the total of N  np neurons is needed where n is the number of transactions and p is the number of items. These neurons can be all arranged in a two-dimensional array of p neurons per row and n neurons per column Let Vn denotes the output of the ith neuron in the array of neurons corresponding to the 7th transaction The energy function that maps the maximal frequent itemsets discovery problem to the Hopfield network is  AnP P nP 2 T=li=lj=l,i#j E C C C VTiVTj B C CvTi\(1-bTi T=l i=l P min bKibK  CnP c P vTivTj\(min P bkibkj k=\222 J 2 T=l i=lj=l ,i#j k=l where A B and C are positive constants whose values decide the relation importance of the constraints to be satisfied Summations range from 1 to n or from 1 to p Some summands appear twice with only the factors interchanged in their order of occurrence in the summand such as V12V13 also as V13V12 like in the first term since indices i and j have the same range from 1 to p For this reason, a factor of 221/z is added The first term in the expression for E corresponds to the constraint of finding maximal frequent itemset In other words this term enforces the constraint that a valid solution contains a maximum number of items Note that the third summation in the first term is over the indexj from 1 to p but excluding whatever the value i has This prevents redundancies from same factors like Vl2VI2 The second term in the expression for E prevents from errors by ensuring that if a neuron v produces a value 1 then the item i is effectively present in the Tth transaction i.e bTi  1 When combined together, the first and the second terms ensure that each row will produce a valid solution with maximal size itemset from the transaction represented by that row The last term aims to satisfy the criterion that a solution must be a frequent itemset i.e its support is more than the user-specified minimum support min In this term the exponential function is used so as if a chosen itemset has its support less than min it is\222penalized heavily In other words let I  min  c bkibkj the term will have a positive value and hence increase the energy if I  0 The term will have a minimum value when the itemset is frequent i.e when I IO Note also that P k=l limI-Ie I  oo and limC-Iee  0 Now, rewriting 1 to take into account the representation of the neurons with double indices we get GTFOO 92 


we rewrite also the expression given by 2 and 3 we obtain Determination of weights and Biases Let us consider 5a and the dynamics of the neural model To obtain the weights TAi,Bj and biases IAi  we substitute 4 in 5c and we compare the obtained expression with 5a The connection strengths i.e the weights\and the biases are derived as follows n min-E bKibK TAi,Bj  c.\(min-fb~b KJ On setting values of the initial input voltages of the neurons the time evolution of the network will result in a steady output of the neurons i.e solution to the ARM problem We implement the Hopfield network in C and the parameters used in our experiments were A=5,50, B=100 C=200 Z  1 and  3 It should be noted that there is not very much guidance as to how to choose the parameters in general for the use of the Hopfield network 6 Conclusion In this paper we have presented an algorithm for frequent itemset discovery using the Hopfield analog neural network We have showed how to map the constraints of the problem into an energy function i.e an objective function\for solution via the neural network Hopfield network is often used by researchers to solve various combinatorial optimization problems Our future work in this area include the use of Hopfield type neural network to solve other data mining problems such as clustering and classification References AS941 R.Agrawa1 and RSrikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules ROC 20 Int.Conf Very Large Databases, Santiago, Chile, September 1994 AIS931 R.Agrawa1 T.Imielinski and A.Swami Mining association between sets of items in massive databases hoc of the ACM SIGMOD 1nt.Conf on management of data pp.207-216, Washington D.C May 1993 CNFF96 David W.Chung Vincent T.Ng, Ada W.Fu and Yongjian Fu Efficient mining of association rules in distributed databases IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering vo1.8 no.6, December 1996 GGR99 V.Ganti J.Gehrke and R.Ramakrishman Mining very large databases.

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
