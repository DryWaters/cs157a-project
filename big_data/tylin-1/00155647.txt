The Anchored Node BackPropagation Network Joseph A Spizuoco Department of Physics S hippensburg University Shippensburg, PA 17257 Abstract Simple modifications to a standard Backpropagation \(BP\network are described that result in a 
90 decrease in training times for an eight input, one hidden layer feedforward network Compared to a similar BP network the modified network is equally good at generalization and is not as sensitive to initial weight settings as measured by its 
likelihood of becoming trapped in a local minimum A NEURAL NETWORK IMPLEMENTATION OF ADAPTIVE BAM Francisco J LOPEZ-ALIGUE Ma Isabel ACEVEDO-SOTOCA and Miguel A JAR AMILLO-MOR AN Departamento 
de Electronica Universidad de Extremadura Avda Elvas s/n 06071  BADAJOZ SPAIN ABSTRACT The general formulation of bidirectional associative memories presents certain difficulties when the associations of pairs of patterns do 
not suppose a local energy minimum To avoid these problems the present work describes an adaptive scheme which allows the correlation matrix to be modified so as to reach the energy minimum while at the 
same time identifying the input patterns The strategy described here allows the adaptation of the matrix to be performed for each external input so that it can henceforth be described as a 
supervised type of training scheme A consequence is its synthesis by means of neural networks with both the RAM and the adaptive mechanism itself integrated in distinct layers, allowing either of 
them to be changed without altering the others The proposed scheme is an extension of the well known neural synthesis for the associative memories through easy rules for building it I1 A-985

It can also be added to cell CrossSales.3\(PC, printer one_year,\205 5  Distributed and Incremental Rule Mining There exist two ways to deal with association rules 267  Static that is, to extract a group of rules from a snapshot, or a history, of data and use "as is 267  Dynamic that is, to evolve rules from time to time using newly available data We mine association rules from an e-commerce data warehouse holding transaction data. The data flows in continuously and is processed daily Mining association rules dynamically has the following benefits 267  223Real-time\224 data mining, that is, the rules are drawn from the latest transactions for reflecting the current commercial trends 267  Multilevel knowledge abstraction, which requires summarizing multiple partial results. For example association rules on the month or year basis cannot be concluded from daily mining results. In fact multilevel mining is incremental in nature 267  For scalability, incremental and distributed mining has become a practical choice Figure 3: Distributed rule mining Incremental association rule mining requires combining partial results. It is easy to see that the confidence and support of multiple rules may not be combined directly. This is why we treat them as \223views\224 and only maintain the association cube, the population cube and the base cube that can be updated from each new copy of volume cube. Below, we discuss several cases to show how a GDOS can mine association rules by incorporating the partial results computed at LDOSs 267  The first case is to sum up volume-cubes generated at multiple LDOSs. Let C v,i be the volume-cube generated at LDOS i The volume-cube generated at the GDOS by combining the volume-cubes fed from these LDOSs is 345   n i i v v C C 1  The association rules are then generated at the GDOS from the centralized C v  214  The second case is to mine local rules with distinct bases at participating LDOSs, resulting in a local association cube C a,I a local population cube C p,I  and a local base cube C b,i at each LDOS. At the GDOS, multiple association cubes, population cubes and base cubes sent from the LDOSs are simply combined, resulting in a summarized association cube and a summarized population cube, as 345   n i i a a C C 1   345   n i i p p C C 1  and 345   n i i b b C C 1  The corresponding confidence cube and support cube can then be derived as described earlier. Cross-sale association rules generated from distinct customers belong to this case In general, it is inappropriate to directly combine association cubes that cover areas a 1 205, a k to cover a larger area a In the given example, this is because association cubes record counts of customers that satisfy   customer product merchant time area Doe TV Dept Store 98Q1 California Doe VCR Dept Store 98Q1 California customer product merchant time area Doe VCR Sears 5-Feb-98 San Francisco Joe PC OfficeMax 7-Feb-98 San Francisco customer product merchant time area Doe TV Fry's 3-Jan-98 San Jose Smith Radio Kmart 14-Jan-98 San Jose Association   population      base          confidence      support cube               cube                cube         cube                cube LDOS LDOS GDOS 


the association condition, and the sets of customers contained in a 1 205, a k are not mutually disjoint. This can be seen in the following examples 214  A customer who bought A and B in both San Jose and San Francisco which are covered by different LDOSs , contributes a count to the rule covering each city, but has only one count, not two, for the rule A  336  B covering California 214  A customer \(e.g. Doe in Figure 3\who bought a TV in San Jose, but a VCR in San Francisco, is not countable for the cross-sale association rule TV  336 VCR covering any of these cities, but countable for the rule covering California. This is illustrated in Figure 3 6  Conclusions In order to scale-up association rule mining in ecommerce, we have developed a distributed and cooperative data-warehouse/OLAP infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to generate association rules with enhanced expressive power, by combining information of discrete commercial activities from different geographic areas, different merchants and over different time periods. In this paper we have introduced scoped association rules  association rules with conjoint items and functional association rules as useful extensions to association rules The proposed infrastructure has been designed and prototyped at HP Labs to support business intelligence applications in e-commerce. Our preliminary results validate the scalability and maintainability of this infrastructure, and the power of the enhanced multilevel and multidimensional association rules. In this paper we did not discuss privacy control in customer profiling However, we did address this issue in our design by incorporating support for the P3P protocol [1 i n  ou r data warehouse. We plan to integrate this framework with a commercial e-commerce system References 1  Sameet Agarwal, Rakesh Agrawal, Prasad Deshpande Ashish Gupta, Jeffrey F.
