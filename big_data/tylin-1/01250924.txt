Complex Spatial Relationships Robert Munro and Sanjay Chawla and Pei Sun School of Information Technologies University of Sydney 000 rmunro chawla psun2712 001 it.usyd.edu.au Abstract This paper describes the need for mining complex relationships in spatial data Complex relationships are de\336ned as those involving two or more of multi-feature colocation self-colocation one-to-many relationships self-exclusion and multi-feature exclusion We demonstrate that even in the mining of simple relationships knowledge f complex relationships is necessary to accurately calculate the significance of results We implement a representation of spatial 
data such that it contains known 324weak-monotonic\325 properties which are exploited for the ef\336cient mining of complex relationships and discuss the strengths and limitations of this representation 1 Introduction A relationship in spatial dat a is a relationship between features in a Euclidean space de\223ned in terms of the colocational trends of two or more features over that space An example is determining the con\223dence of the 324where there\325s smoke there\325s 336re\325 with respect to a set of coordinates each representing the feature smoke or 223re The task here would be to determine whether 223re occurs in the neighborhood of 
smoke more than is randomly likely Neighborhoods are de\223ned in terms of cliques also known as neighbor-sets A clique is de\223ned as any set of items such that all items in that set colocate for example in Figure 1 and Table 1 the colocational pattern 000 A,D 001 occurs three times in four cliques iv v/vi  ix Two features are typically said to colocate if they are positioned within a distance 000 of one another As has been assumed in Figure 1 
000 is usually constant but it may also be de\223ned as varying locally within the space or with respect to a given feature Typically the mining of information in a spatial domain involves representing the cliques as transactions and undertaking association rule mining upon these transactions While association e mining s a well-developed 223eld 5  the mining of con\223dent cliques as transactions fails to capture many spatial phenomena of interest due to most as 
sociation mining techniques being optimized for 217marketbasket\220 data Spatial data is fundamentally different from market-basket data both in its basic nature and distributional tendencies One factor unique to spatial data is that e number of transactions a single item may participate in is potentially unbounded while in a market-basket this is limited to one obviously two people may purchase the same toothpaste product but not the same exact tube Self-colocation is also more likely in spatial data The upper limit in a marketbasket is multiple purchases of only one product which is 
less likely than an equivalent spatial situation of an area of monoculture forest Similarly there may be irect relationships between features that don\220t colocate as between animals displaying territorial behavior making such relationships intrinsically more interesting in spatial data A complex relationship is simply any combination of these different relationships It is important to note that while the relationships are de\223ned as complex the phenomena they represent are often very simple 8 Perhaps the most fundamental difference between spa 
tial and other data in a transactional representation is the notion of signi\223cance A colocation is considered signi\223cant if it occurs more than is randomly likely In transactions representing market-baskets the transactions by de\223nition represent the complete space of the data there are no empty baskets In such cases the signi\223cance of the data may be represented by frequency of the features in relation to the number of transactions such as e interest measure proposed in In s p at i a l d at a ho we v e r  t h e r andom l i k elihood of a colocation depends on the volume of the space

3 Related Work The 223rst n f the Apriori paradigm to spatial data was in 7  H o w e v er in their method the y materialized all the possible spatial relationships that they intended to mine This is equivalent to determining e universe of candidate interesting elationships Thus in some ways their technique was 217hypothesis driven\220 rather than 217hypothesis generating.\220 An ef\223cient algorithm to mine a kind of spatial colocations was presented in 11 The concept s o f nei ghborhood participation ratio and participation index were de\223ned Instead of support the participation index was used as a pruning measure in the conventional Apriori-like technique The drawback of above method is that some con\223dent colocation rules with low support are also pruned In order to solve this problem 6 propos ed t h e c oncept of maxi mal participation index and it was used as pruning measure to replace the participation index  We will discuss these measures in detail in the next section as they are central to our approach In 12 an al gori t h m w as us ed t o mi ne bot h pos i t i v e and negative association rules Negative rules are generated from infrequent item sets and interest is used as a further pruning measure Their algorithm involves no spatial component 4 Maximal Participation Ratio In this section we will brie\224y describe the notion of Maximal Participation Index maxPI as described in w here more details can be found 4.1 Participation ratio Given a colocation pattern 000 and a feature 001 000 000 the participation ratio of 001  002\003 000 000\004 001 001  can be de\223ned as the support of 000 divided by the support of 001  For example in Figure 1 the support of 001 005\004 006 004 007 002 is 002 and the support of 007 is 003 so 002\003 000 001 005\004 006 004 007 002 004\007 001\004\002 b 003  4.2 Maximal participation index Given a co-location pattern 000  the maximal participation index f 000  t\n\013\f r 000 000 001 can be de\223ne as the maximal participation ratio of all the features in 000 thatis t\n\013\f r 000 000 001\004 t\n\013 000 000 001 000 002\003 000 000\004 001 001\001 016 1 For example in Figure 1 t\n\013\f r 000 001 005\004 006 004 007 002 001 004 t\n\013 000 002\003 000 001 005\004 006 004 007 002 004\005 001  002\003 000 001 005\004 006 004 007 002 004\006 001  002\003 000 001 005\004 006 004 007 002 004\007 001\001 004 t\n\013 000\002 b 005 004 002 b 006 004 002 b 003\001 004 002 b 006 A high maximal participation index indicates that at least one spatial feature strongly implies the pattern By using maxPI low frequency con\223dent rules can be found which would be pruned by a support threshold 6  4.3 The weak monotonic property of maxPI Maximal participation index is not monotonic with respect to the pattern containment relations For example in the Figure 1 000 t\n\013\f r 000 005\004 007 001 004 006 b 005\001 017 000 t\n\013\f r 000 005\004 006 004 007 001\004\002 b 006\001  Interestingly as pointed out in 6 t he maxi mal part i c i p at i o n i nde x does ha v e t h e fol l o wing weak monotonic property If f is a k-colocation pattern then there exists at most one 000 020 003 007\001 subpatterns f 001 of f such that t\n\013\f r 000 f 001 001 017 t\n\013\f r 000 f 001  Relying on this weak monotonic property the Apriori-like algorithm can be modi\223ed to mine con\223dent patterns by using a maxPI threshold 5 Relationship De\336nitions 5.1 Notation used Feature In this paper a feature is represented as a capital letter for example 005  Item An instance of a feature one item is represented as the feature followed by an id number unique for that feature for example 005 000  Absence The absence of an item is represented by negation for example 003 005  te this is not e equivalent of the set-theory 004 005  meaning the presence of any item other than A Self-colocation Multiple instances of a feature multiple items are represented by a 217 b 220 following the feature for example 005 b  5.2 Types of Spatial Relationships Here we de\223ne the different types of spatial relationships that are desirable to mine Positive Simple Relationships This is the most common type of relationship mined describing for example the fraction of 005 220s that colocate with a 006 eg 005 005 006 De\336nition 1 A positive relationship multi-feature colocation in spatial data is a set of features that colocate at a ratio greater than some prede\223ned threshold Self-colocation  Self-exclusion This is the measure of which a feature tends to colocate with itself Formally it is the average cardinality of an item in a clique with Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


respect to the expected cardinality of a random distribution Extreme self-exclusion will be a perfectly uniform distribution with respect to the data space eg 000 000 000 000 De\336nition 2 A feature is de\223ned as self-colocating in spatial data if the items representing that feature colocate with each other at a ratio greater than some prede\223ned threshold De\336nition 3 A feature is de\223ned as self-excluding in spatial data if the items representing that feature colocate with each other at a ratio less than some prede\223ned threshold One-to-Many relationships This explicitly captures the cardinality of a relationship between two features eg 001 000 000 000  De\336nition 4 Two features are de\223ned as having a oneto-many relationship in spatial data if one feature occurs multiple times in the presence of the other feature greater than some pre-de\223ned threshold Included within this de\223nition are two-way one-to-many manyto-many relationships Multi-feature exclusive relationships These are exclusive relationships with respect to two or more features In terms of a transactional representation they are negative rules which are explored in 12 e g  000 000\001 001 De\336nition 5 A multi-feature exclusive relationship in spatial data is de\223ned as where a feature is absent from a given colocation at a ratio greater than a prede\223ned threshold Complex relationships These are any combination of two or more spatial relationship types De\336nition 6 A complex relation in spatial data is any relationship containing two or ore of the properties de\223ned in de\223nitions 1-5 The independent application of the above rules may produce complex relationships such as 000 000 000 001 and 000 000\001 002  but will not produce complex relationships such as 002 000 000 003 001 002 003\000 001 000  5.3 Sparse data and the mining of absence A participation index directly addresses the problem that a certain item may have low support resulting in it being absent from very many cliques and hence having a high negative support in that it with therefore have a low participation ratio for each of those cliques For example if 004 is an infrequent feature then the rule 000 000 001 004 will most likely be con\223dent However the participation ratio of 001 004 in 002 000\003 001 004 003 will be very low as 001 004 will occur in many cliques In other words the participation ratio of 001 004 in 002 000\003 001 004 003 will only be high if 004 is atypically absent from cliques containing 000  Therefore when using a participation ratio for sparse data there is in fact a gain in ef\223ciency The results in section 7 con\223rm this 6 Statistical Applications of Complex Relationships Complex tionships are not d to g complex rules Complex tionships can be used to provide stronger de\223nitions and more accurate signi\223cance testing for simple relationships 6.1 Signi\336cance as a Complex relationship In terms of con\223dence the signi\223cance of a rule is given by the extent to which the observed con\223dence of a rule differs from the expected con\223dence given by a random distrition Lemma 1 The signi\223cance of a con\223dence rule of the form 000 000 001  is independent of the self-colocation exclusion of 000  but is dependent on the selfcolocation/exclusion of 001  Proof Outline In general given that 000 occurs with frequency 005 000 000 001 and 001 with frequency 005 000 001 001 inatwo dimensional space with dimensions 006 and 007  with cliques formed by a distance b the random chance of 000 000 001 can be given by the product of the fraction of the total volume that each features occupies 005 000 000 001 t\b 000 006\007 005 000 001 001 t\b 000 006\007 002 005 000 000 001 005 000 001 001 t 000 b 000 006 001 007 001 2 The problem with the above however is that 001 may not be exclusively distributed with respect to itself Note that the random chance will not change with respect to the self-colocation/exclusion of 000 Thetwo extreme cases are 000 self-excludes such that no 000 220s are in the same clique the equation given above and 000 self-colocates such that all 000 220s co-occur in one clique In the second case all 000 220s occupy an effective total space of t\b 001 giving 005 000 000 001 an effective value of 1 However if a 001 exists in that clique then all 000 220s in that clique colocate with it so the equation must be multiplied by the number of 000 220s in the clique n s case 005 000 000 001  The equation is therefore e equivalent of where A self-excludes The random chance will however change with respect to the self-colocation/exclusion of 001  Assume the two extreme cases 001 self-excludes such that no 001 220s are in the same clique again is is e equation given above and 001 self-colocates such that all 001 220s co-occur Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


in one clique In the second case all 000 220s occupy n effective total space of 001\002 000 giving 003 000 000 001 an effective valueof1 Ifone 004 exists in that clique the number of 000 220s in that clique has no effect on the con\223dence as by de\223nition 1 only one unique 004 colocates with a 000  The expected value of 004 000 000 is therefore given by 003 000 004 001\002 001 000 002 000 005 001 006 001 3 As the two extreme cases demonstrate the expected value of 004 000 000 exists in a range with boundaries differing by a factor of 003 000 000 001  The consequence of this is that an accurate measure of the signi\223cance of a rule 004 000 000 must also include the measure of 000 220s selfcolocation/exclusion The importance of this becomes obvious when in spatial data 003 000 000 001 may literally be the number of stars in the sky Therefore by de\223nition 6 in order to measure e signi\223cance of a simple relationship 004 000 000  it is necessary to know a complex relationship An approximation of self-exclusion may be given by the ratio of the number of cliques containing 000 to the total number of 000  Assuming 000 occurs in 007\b 000 000 001 cliques This can underestimate the random chance as it doesn\220t take into account the intersection of cliques in the data space where two or more 000 220s are greater than distance 002 but less than distance 003 002 apart or over-estimate as it doesn\220t take into account the distance between items within a clique Alternatively a calculation of deviance from expected behaviour can be found by observing the original coordinate distributions with a metric such as Ripley\220s K-function 2 This will not neces s a rily gi v e a m ore accurate meas ure as it relates to global distributions not cliques but it\220s relationship with colocation mining and clique representations is in itself an interesting area deserving further investigation Perhaps the most intuitive reason for above is because n the spatial domain the rule 004 000 000 cannot be divorced from it\220s spatial properties Even when 004 and 000 represent coordinates 004 must be thought of as coordinates and 000 must be thought of as potentially overlapping volumes This is a general truism for spatial data and will hold whether a constant or variable 002 is used and when a simpler lique de\223nition is given such as the division of the feature space into 220grids\220 or a more complicated de\223nition such as the result of a clustering algorithm Lemma 2 The potential range of con\223dence rules of the form 004 000 000  will depend on the selfcolocation/exclusion of both 004 and 000  Proof Outline While the exclusion of 004 does not affect the signi\223cance of a con\223dence rule it can limit the possible range of the observed con\223dence Assuming that all 004 220s and 000 220s self-exclude then as in market-basket data the maximum possible con\223dence for 004 000 000 is simply given by t\n\013 000 003 000 000 001 003 000 004 001 f 002 001 4 Where 003 000 004 001 r\003 000 000 001  this will obviously be less than 1 However if A self-colocates such that 007\b 000 004 001 001 003 000 000 001 than the maximum possible con\223dence will be 1 Similarly if B self-colocates then e maximum possible con\223dence may be lower The exact measure for the maximum possible observed con\223dence is t\n\013 000 007\b 000 000 001 007\b 000 004 001 f 002 001 5 A further factor that is not discussed here is where the potential size of some cliques tend beyond the boundaries of the measured space Again the random likelihood of this will relate to the ratio between 002 and e imensions of the space Here it is simply assumed that it is very low 6.2 Exclusion and maxPI As a support threshold can prune con\223dent rules with low frequency a maxPI threshold can prune con\223dent rules with low participation While maxPI will return the complete set of items that satisfy both thresholds of maxPI and the minimum con\223dence there may be the case such that a high con\223dence rule will not have a high corresponding maximal participation index An improved measure of participation includes the atypical exclusion of an item We posit that by including the absence of items negative items we may discover a more robust measure for a participation index measure 7 A Representation of Spatial Data r Mining Complex Relationships In this section we propose and test one simple representation of spatial data that facilitates the ef\223cient mining of complex relationships 7.1 Mining complex relationships using the maximal participation index In terms of the steps in the problem de\223nition the steps taken are Generate all positive cliques in a transactional representation adding features representing the absence of Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

Typically the number of complex relationships found was greater than but correlated with the number of other relationship types found As Figure 9 shows the number of complex relationships at a given con\223dence threshold was sensitive to the variance in the number of the other relationship types Self-exclusion and self-colocation were modeled together in Figure 9 emphasize the complementary relationship between the two as described in section 5.2 This is revealed in the corresponding steepness f gradient for self-exclusion/colocation at con\223dence 000 000 001 001 and con\223dence 002 000 001 002  7.5 Limitations/Strengths of the representation While there are representational issues with any type of data appropiate representation is particularly important in the spatial domain 9 Limitations In one-to-many relationships this model doesn\220t capture interesting ranges or distributions in the 217many\220 which is a task better suited for mixture modelling or the techniques described in As pointed out in 10 t h e cos t o f ful l y t r ans cri b i n g s pat i a l data into a transactional representation can in some cases be more expensive than the mining of the colocations but as a full representation is necessary to accurately add the features representing absent and multiple items a solution to this in the current representation may be problematic Strengths The most obvious strength of this representation is that currently it is the only model that allows the mining of complex relationships in spatial data A major strength of a transactional representation of spatial data not explored here is that it may be combined with non-spatial data and so the addition of nonspatial data to the representation described here would be uncomplicated 8 Conclusions  Future Work We have de\223ned the concept of complex relationships in spatial data We have described how even in transactional representations spatial data is undamentally erent from other forms of data making the need to mine complex relationships of inherent interest We have demonstrated that even when simple relationships are the goal of mining spatial data the mining of complex relationships is necessary for determining the signi\223cance of those relationships We have implemented and demonstrated a transactional representation of spatial data that allows the ef\223cient mining of complex relationships and discussed its limitations and strengths 8.1 Future Work Apart from investigating improvements to the representation to address the limitations mentioned in 7.5 there are several future directions evident such as the application to other types of data with a spatial component such as spatiotemporal data and to a lesser extent natural language and biological systems One important step would be the combination of spatial coordinate features with spa tial volume features this is especially important in Geographic Information Systems where a volume may represent the area of a lake valley etc As we have demonstrated that with a purely coordinate system 003 in 004 000 003 must be treated as a volume the inclusion of features that explicitly represent volumes should prove interesting References  R  A gra w al and R  S r i kant  F ast al gori t h ms for m i n i n g a ssociation rules In J B Bocca M Jarke and C Zaniolo editors Proc 20th Int

Such a small mod ification to the original HPA algorithm could improve the linearity substantially 4.6 Effect of increasing transaction Figure 13 shows the effect of increasing transac tion database sue as the number of transactions is increased from 256,000 to 2 million transactions We used the data set t15.14 The behavior of the results does not change with increased database size The minimum support value was set to 0.4 The num ber of processors is kept at 16 As shown each of the parallel algorithms attains linearity 5 Summary and related work In this paper we proposed four parallel algorithms for mining association rules A summary of the four database size Sizeup 0 I 0 500 loo0 1500 uxw amount of transaction thousands Figure 13 Sizeup curve algorithms is shown in Table 5 In NPA the candi date itemsets are just copied amongst all the proces sors Each processor works on the entire candidate itemsets NPA requires no data transfer when the supports are counted However in the case where the entire candidate itemsets do not fit within the mem ory of a single processor the candidate itemsets are divided and the supports are counted by scanning the transaction database repeatedly Thus Disk 1/0 cost of NPA is high PDM, proposed in 6 is the same as NPA which copies the candidate itemsets among all the processors Disk 1/0 for PDM should be also high The remaining three algorithms SPA HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets over the memory space of all the processors Because it better exploits the total system's memory, disk 1/0 cost is low SPA arbitrarily partitions the candidate itemsets equally among the processors Since each processor broadcasts its local transaction data to all other pro cessors the communication cost is high HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets using a hash function which eliminates the need for transac tion data broadcasting and can reduce the comparison workload significantly HPA-ELD detects frequently occurring itemsets and handles them separately which can reduce the influence of the workload skew 6 Conclusions Since mining association rules requires several scans of the transaction file its computational requirements are too large for a single processor to have a reasonable response time This motivates our research In this paper we proposed four different parallel algorithms for mining association rules on a shared nothing parallel machine and examined their viabil 29 


Table 5 characteristics of algorithms ity through implementation on a 64 node parallel ma chine the Fujitsu AP1000DDV If a single processor can hold all the candidate item sets parallelization is straightforward It is just suf ficient to partition the transaction over the proces sors and for each processor to process the allocated transaction data in parallel We named this algo rithm NPA However when we try to do large scale data mining against a very large transaction file the candidate itemsets become too large to fit within the main memory of a single processor In addition to the size of a transaction file a small minimum support also increases the size of the candidate itemsets As we decrease the minimum support computation time grows rapidly but in many cases we can discover more interesting association rules SPA HPA and HPA-ELD not only partition the transaction file but partition the candidate itemsets among all the processors We implemented these al gorithms on a shard-nothing parallel machine Per formance evaluations show that the best algorithm HPA-ELD attains good linearity on speedup by fully utilizing all the available memory space which is also effective for skew handling At present we are doing the parallelization of mining generalized association rules described in 9 which includes the taxonomy is-a hierarchy Each item belongs to its own class hierarchy In such mining associations between the higher class and the lower class are also examined Thus the candidate itemset space becomes much larger and its computation time also takes even longer than the naive single level association mining Parallel pro cessing is essential for such heavy mining processing Acknowledgments This research is partially supported as a priority research program by ministry of education We would like to thank the F\221ujitsu Parallel Computing Research Center for allowing us to use their APlOOODDV sys tems References l R.Agrawal T.Imielinski and ASwami 223Min ing Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Manage ment of Data pp207-216 May 1993 2 R.Agrawal and RSrikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.487-499 September 1994 3 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223An Effec tive Hash-Based Algorithm for Mining Associ ation Rules\224 In Proc of the 1995 ACM SIG MOD International Conference on the Manage ment of Data SIGMOD Record Vo1.24 pp.175 186 June 1995 4 H.Mannila H.Toivonen and A.I.Verkamo 223Ef ficient Algorithms for Discovering Association Rules\224 In KDD-94:AAAI Workshop on Knowl edge Discovery in Databases pp.181-192 July 1994 5 A.Savasere, E.Omiecinski and S.Navathe 223An Effective Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 21th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.432-444 September 1995 6 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223Efficient Parallel Data Mining for Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 4th International Conference on In formation and Knowledge Management pp.31 36 November 1995 7 T.Shintani and M.Kitsuregawa 223Considera tion on Parallelization of Database Mining\224 In Institute of Electronics Information and Com munication Engineering Japan SIG CPS Y95 88 Technical Report Vo1.95 No.47 pp.57-62 December 1995 8 T.Shimizu T.Horie and H.Ishihata 223Perfor mance Evaluation of the APlOOO Effects of message handling broadcast and barrier syn chronization on benchmark performance-\224  In S WO PP 22292 9.2 ARC 95 Information Processing Society of Japan Vo1.92 No.64 1992 9 R.Srikant and R.Agrawal 223Mining Generalized Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 21th Inter national Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.407-419 September 1995 30
