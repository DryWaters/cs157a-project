Query Fuzzy Association Rules in Relational Database Joyce Y Shu Eric C.C Tsang Daniel S Yeung Department of Computing Hong Kong Polytechnic University Emails: csyshu, csetsang csdaniel@comp.polyu.edu.hk Abstract An important issue to extend database management systems functionality is to allow the expression of imprecise queries to make these systems able to satisfy user needs more closely In the last few years some authors have dealt with the problem of relaxing the 
relational model in order to admit some imprecision Two significant data mining problems have been addressed recently namely the mining fuzzy association rules and set-oriented mining for association rules in relational database SETM algorithms in l At present the problem how to express the mining fuzzy association rules algorithm as SQL queries have not been proposed. In this paper we attempted to develop a fuzzy version of SETM algorithms that can be expressed as SQL queries in 
relational databases and discuss optimization of the algorithm Index Ternif-Data mining fuzzy association rules linguistic terms 1 Introduction Association rule which is widely used to represent sequence relationships between various factors is a kind of important knowledge to which the data mining tools are applied especially areas involving large amount of transaction data such as retail industry and banking Fuzzy association rule provides a powerful tool to represent imprecision and discovers qualitative patterns for massive numerical and continuous data 
Linguistic data mining solution is a general strategy proposed in this paper to deal with the data and other business applications It is motivated by the various challenges that have been emerged with the proliferation of numerical continuous and rapidly changing data, as well as the acute need to improve the understandability of discovered knowledge Nowadays DBMS systems are used widely in different areas Fast, reliable and unlimited secondary storage provides a perfect environment for the users 
to collect and store large amounts of the data The mountain of raw data was stored in databases Relational database is a major role which is full of all trades and professionals The emerging data mining system lead naturally to the demand of a powerful data mining query language on top of which many interactive and flexible graphical user interfaces can be developed This motivates vigorous researchers on mining association rules in relational databases for 
several years Several researchers have proposed a series of excellent works about data mining query language for relational database  1,4 To discovery association rules in relational database M.Houtsma and A Swami described set-oriented algorithm SETM in ll In 4 J Han examine the general philosophies which influence the design of such a data mining query language and present stepby-step a tentatively designed Data Mining Query Language 
DMQL Today relational databases are full of all trades and professionals In this paper we are interested in describing set-oriented algorithm for mining fuzzy association rules The remains of the paper are organized as follows. In Section 2 the related works on the generalizing fuzzy relational database and studies on the querying language for relational databases are outlined. Section 3 investigates the definitions and methodology 
of querying fuzzy association rules in relational databases Section 4 shows the experimental results The last section concludes the paper 2 Generalize fuzzy relational database from the classic databases Before we express the mining fuzzy association rules algorithm as SQL queries the first part is to generalize the fuzzy relational database from the numerical relational databases 0-7803-7@78-3/0l/$lO~OO C IEEE Page 2989 


2.1 Data Structure For mining linguistic association rules in relational database we store information in a relational database system using a table with the following schema TRANSACTIONS\(trans-id item linguistic-term To map the numeric data into linguistic term the basic elements of a fuzzy extension of the relational model called GEFRED has been used From the model described in 2 some criteria for representation and handling of imprecise information are introduced The main goal to achieve with the model is to give support that is general enough for the representation and handling of all kinds of fuzzy information Some of the data types are  A single number Age  28 represented by the possibility distribution 1/28 A set of mutually exclusive possible scalar assignations Behavior  good bad represented by the possibility distribution  llgood lhad A possibility distribution in a scalar domain Bchavior  0.6had 0.7/normal  A possibility distribution in a numeric domain Age  0.3/23 1.0/24 0.8/25 fuzzy numbers or linguistic labels As we are concerned with the representation of imprecise data we must store the following information in the database \(Table 1 Data Type F TYPE CRISP 0 LABEL 1 INTERVAL[A,B 2 APROX\(d 3 Table 1 Data Type representation 2.2 Fiizzy relutional model To store data we have to define our fuzzy relational model Mathematically a fuzzy relational schema R\(A,,--.,A,,,pu is made up of a relation name R Definition I Chiang et al 3 Let R A    A  p  t  be a fuzzy relational schema An n-ary fuzzy relation r over R is a set of Dom\(A Dom\(A f[A refers to the value in t for attribute Ai and each tuple t is an element of Dom\(A A That is 2.3 Fuuifying numerical attribute into linguistic terms This is a process of fuzzifying numerical numbers into linguistic terms which is often used to reduce information overload in human making decision process The numerical salary for example may be perceived in linguistic terms as high, average and low One way of determining membership functions of these linguistic terms is by expert opinion or by people\222s perception Yet another way is by statistical methods 5 Fuzzy clustering based on self-organized learning can also be used to generate membership functions 6 What follows is an algorithm for generating certain type of membership functions  Let X be the considered data set We intend to cluster X into k linguistic terms pj j 1 2  k For simplicity we assume the type of membership to be triangular Each linguistic term pi will have the triangular membership functions as follows Each pair of adjacent membership functions crosses at the membership value of 0.5 The only parameters needed to be determined are the k centers nl,nl,...,n  An effective method to determine these centers is the Kohonen feature maps algorithm 6 At the initial time k centers are set to be distributed evenly on the range of X Let 1 xl4 az-xMa2-4 4 cxca 0 x2a and a list of attributes A Az  An pr  Each attribute A is the name of a role played by some domain Dom\(A and p is characterized by the following membership function Page 2990

3 FSETM Algorithm In this section we use the algorithm SETM l in querying fuzzy association rules in relational databases In order to find fuzzy association rules we need to scan transactions for reoccurring patterns that occur often enough to be of interest The pattern\222s relation C\222 has relational schema iteml linguistic-terml   item linguistic-rermb count All rules are found by consecutively generating all qualifying pattems from length 1 to k Now we assume that there is no duplication of record in the relational database In other word if the trans-id and item are the same the linguistic-term must be different In this case the framework of our proposed algorithm for querying fuzzy association rules named FSETM is similar to the SETM algorithm but the detailed steps contain some differences such as count support generate candidate relations C and generate relations RP from c Algorithm FSETM consists of a single loop, in which two sorted operations and one merge-scan join are performed The problem of mining fuzzy association rules in relational databases can be decomposed into the following three steps Generate all lexicographically ordered patterns of length k in Ri from Rf+l and the original transaction table R  RP  merge-scan R  R  We sorted Rf\(k-l on trans-idjterq linguistic_tew     iteq linguistic_terq Generate C according to count for the pattems in Rk that meet the minimum support constraint This step involves a simple sequential scan over  R Cll  generate counts from R iL  Select R from R SELECT p.transjd p.iteml  p.itemk.l p.linguistic-term   p.linguistic-termk q.item, q.linguistic-term FROM Rk-1 p TRANSACTION 9 WHERE q.trans-id  p.trans-id AMD 266.item  p.itemk.1 Generate C\222 INSERTINTO Ck SELECT pitem   p.itemk, p.linguistic_term   p.linguistic-termk COUNT FROM Rkp GROUP BY p.item  p.item p.linguistic-terml   p.linguistic-termk HA VI\224 COUNT  Generate Rfi INSERT INTO Rk\221 SELECT p.item  pitem p.linguistic-term    p.linguistic-termk FROM Rk.1 p Cfiq WHERE q.iteml=p. item q.linguistic-termr=p.linguistic-terml AND q.itemt=p itemk q.linguistic-termk=p linguistic termk ORDER BY p.trans-id p.iteml  p.itemk p.linguistic-terml    p.linguistic-termk 4 Demonstration This section gives a case study of the adult data selected by a census of the United States in 1990 Table I in section 1 to illustrate how to discovery R  filter Rb to retain supported patterns We can repeat this process until R  4 The subroutines are outlined as follows Generate Rfl\222 INSERT INTO Rr 222 fuzzy association rules in relational databases In the following we will compare the execution time between the set-oriented mining association rules algorithm SEW and it\222s fuzzy version FSETM Page 2992 


Data Source and systems In order to test the algorithm with the real world application we selected 10000 transaction records as our testing data set In our example data, six attributes i.e income, education level, sex age marital status and relationship with others in family are taken into account Execution time The execution time in this experiment is carried out to show the performance of the algorithm FSETM on the DELL Optiplex GXlMDSK500 In order to test the algorithm we use the 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 as the minimum supports We choose these values because they can help to generate a reasonable number of large itemsets Comparing the algorithm SETM proposed in l we see that algorithm SETM and algorithm FSETM are very stable. These result are presented in Table 5 in which Table a shows the execution time of the algorithm FSETM b the execution time of the algorithm SETM b Table 5 Execution time 5 Conclusion We designed a preliminary version of querying fuzzy association rules FSETM for effective data mining in relational databases The major contribution of this paper is that it developed the algorithm SETM into mining fuzzy association rules applications In the future we will attempt to use the algorithm in financial data analysis, such as stock movement prediction 0-7803-707&3/0U$lO C IEEE Acknowledgement This work is supported by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Central Research Grant G-V762 Reference M Houtsma and A Swami 223Set-oriented Mining for Association Rules in Relational Databases,\224 In proceeding of the IIIh International Conference on Data Engineering 1995 pp 25-33 J.M Medina 0 Pons and M.A Vila GEFRED 223A Generalized Model for Fuzzy Relational Databases,\224 Information Sciences 76 1994 pp 87-109 D A Chiang L R Chow and Y F Wang 223Mining time series data by a fuzzy linguistic summary system,\224 Fuzzy Sets and Systems 112,2000 Pages, pp 419-432 J Han Y Fu K,Kopershi W Wang and O.Zaiane 223DMQL A Data Mining Query Language for Relational Databases,\224 1996 SIGOMOD Workshop on Research Issues on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery DMKD\22296\Montreal, Canada June 1996 M R Civanlar and H J Trussell 223Constructing membership functions using statistical data 224 Fuw Sets and Systems vol 18, 1986 pp 1-14 T Kohonen, \223Self-Organization and Associate Memory,\224 Springer, Berlin 1988 Page 2993
