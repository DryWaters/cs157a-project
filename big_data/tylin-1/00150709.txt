is in the Tracks Decision Rule  power  especially when the signal power estimate is biased  We then present a tracks initiation algorithm using a global Maximum Likelihood Estimate MU  and a filter derived from the Probabilistic Data Association Filter PDAP  including the signal Power and Detection probability Pd estimates  Results will be presented in the frame of a Monte Carlo simulation with a Track Detection criterion  This will be checked with the association test 1 Introduction This paper will cope with the single source Tracking Problem  generally presented as a filtering of tracks updated with measurements present in a gate around the predicted value  
at each scan one coming from the target if detected and the others being false alarms  originating from self or medium noise  This is known as the uncertain correlation problem solved by associating the correct updates  Both data association and filtering are generally made only with the target estimated kinematics and measured positions  as bearing e in passive broadband sonar  Then one uses the track power'in order to make a decision on tracks confidence  Let z be the measurement vector  X the state vector  we but cannot choose the natural Cartesian equation x  y  0 in unobservable passive systems

seems natural in order to select zi and compute B\(k,i to use all the available information  say both the position and the SNR as is done in the tracks decision rule  This will be checked in the next section  We then present a track initiation technique using sliding bearing gates and MLE  and also a track statistics calculation  we develop the PDASI algorithm derived from the Probabilistic Data Association PDA   and using the Signal Information  including estimates of the signal power and of Pd which is not a priori known in automatic surveillance systems  Detection curves are then presented for NNA  PDA and PDASI  using our initiation algorithm 
 2 Data association tests 6 i In a fourth part Given a measurement z we test that it is a false alarm or a true one  We will compare two tests  The first one uses only the bearing and the second one uses both the bearing and the SNR  The first test considers z  8  with hypothesis H  8 is from the target, normally distributed with known mean and unknown covariance uB2  n the prediction gate of width A I 2p0   8 is a false alarm  with uniform bearing In the second test

However it is expensive to sort the original data by density Instead of sorting we make buckets corresponding to ranges of row density for each row That is we divide the original data according to the number of 1's in each row with ranges of 2 i  2 i 1   when we scan the data the 002rst time Then in the next scan we read the lower density buckets 002rst Note that the number of buckets is no more than d log 2 m e 1  b\b p a g e-link g ra p h   1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 0 50000 100000 150000 200000 of rows processed Memory\(KB   1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 0 50000 100000 150000 200000 250000 of rows processed Memory\(KB a\eb access lo g Figure 3 Memory size for a counter array 4.2 Memory\255explosion elimination Scanning the densest rows last may cause memory explosion at the end of the algorithm Fig 3 shows the memory consumption for Web-access-log and Web-pagelink data without support pruning when extracting 100%con\002dence rules The required memory size explodes at the end of the processing since both data sets have several rows with many 1's To avoid memory explosion we switch the algorithm from the memory-consuming algorithm DMC-base to an algorithm that uses more time but uses less space We assume that there are few rows with many 1's Therefore when and if the memory explosion begins we can read the rest of the rows and create bitmaps for each column in main memory The low-memory algorithm DMC-bitmap  consists of 2 phases In the 002rst phase it cleans up the candidate list for those c j such that cnt  c j   maxmis  c j   and in the second phase it extracts implication rules c j  c k  for those c j such that cnt  c j  024 maxmis  c j   Algorithm 4.1  DMC-bitmap 1 When the memory needed for counters exceeds a threshold and the bitmaps for the rest of the rows r i  i  t t 1 n  can 002t in main memory read the rest of the rows r i from M and create  n 000 t 1 bits of a bitmap bm  c j   for each column c j such that cnt  c j   ones  c j  227that is we do not have to create bitmaps for those columns that have no 1's in the rest of rows In order for this method to work there must be enough memory to maintain the counter array until such time as the bitmaps will 002t in the same memory 2 Phase 1 For each column c j that has a non-NULL candidate list and cnt  c j   maxmis  c j   017 Count the number of misses for c j  c k such that c k 2 cand  c j  by counting the number of 1's in bm  c j   bm  c k   017 If the total number of misses is no more than maxmis  c j   then output c j  c k as a result 017 Free the candidate list for c j  3 Phase 2 For each column c j such that cnt  c j  024 maxmis  c j   017 Initialize hit counter hit  c k  to 0 If cand  c j  is non-NULL set hit  c k  cnt  c j  000 mis  c j c k  for each column c k 2 cand  c j  where mis  c j c k  is the number of misses of c j against c k  017 Count the number of hits in the rest of rows r i  i  t t 1 n   by increasing each hit counter hit  c k  such that c k 2 r i  for each row r i such that r i 2 c j  017 For each column c k such that ones  c k   ones  c j  or  ones  c k  ones  c j  and k>j   if hit  c k  025 ones  c j  000 maxmis  c j  then output c j  c k as a result 4.3 100%\255rule pruning Finding 100%-con\002dence rules is much easier than 002nding less-than-100%-con\002dence rules We do not have to count the number of misses since we can delete a candidate as soon as we 002nd a miss for it Therefore we only have to keep the candidate ID lists in main memory 


Furthermore we can also simplify both the DMC-base and DMC-bitmap algorithms since after 002nding the 002rst 1 on a column c j  there is no chance of adding any candidates into the candidate list cand  c j     1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 1 10 100 1000 10000 of 1's in a column of columns Web access log Page link Dic tionar y New s Web access lo g Page link News Dictionary Figure 4 Column density distribution Suppose that we want to extract 90 or more con\002dence rules In such a case a column that has fewer than 9 1's must have no miss Therefore if we can extract 100%con\002dence rules 002rst then we only consider those columns that have 10 or more 1's Fig 4 shows the distribution of the number of 1's in each column of four real data sets Since our data has many columns with few 1's this optimization improves the performance 4.4 DMC\255imp algorithm The 002nal algorithm to extract implication rules is following Algorithm 4.2  DMC-imp 1 Read M and count the number of 1's for each column ones  c i   Partition the data into buckets B i  i  0  d log 2 m e  according to the number of 1's for each row 2 Extract 100%-con\002dence rules by using the simpli\002ed DMC-base and DMC-bitmap algorithms Note we can skipStep1of DMC-base and we should scan the sparsest buckets 002rst In Phase 2 of DMC-bitmap we count the number of misses between c j and all c k that have at least one of rows r t r t 1 r n in common with c j  3 Remove columns c j such that ones  c j  024 1  1 000 minconf   4 Extract less-than-100%-con\002dence rules by using the DMC-base and DMC-bitmap algorithms Note that we can skip Step 1 of DMC-base and we should scan the sparsest buckets 002rst In our implementation we switch the algorithm from DMCbase to DMC-bitmap when the number of remaining rows becomes 64 or less and the memory size for the counter array that keeps both miss counters and candidate lists for each column exceeds 50MB Note that even if the memory size exceeds 50MB we do not switch the algorithm if the number of remaining rows is more than 64 regardless of the number of columns 5 Finding similarity rules We can 002nd similarity rules more ef\002ciently than we can implication rules since we can apply two more optimization techniques column-density pruning and maximum-hits pruning  5.1 Column\255density pruning If column c i and c j  such that j S i j\024j S j j have minsim or more similarity the ratio of the number of 1's j S i j  j S j j  must be minsim or more minsim 024 Sim  c i c j  j S i  S j j j S i  S j j 024 j S i j j S j j 024 1 Therefore we can save the memory space for miss counters for those column pairs c i and c j such that j S i j  j S j j  minsim  since we do not have to consider such pairs 5.2 Maximum\255hits pruning Similarity is affected by the number of misses of both c i against c j and c j against c i  while con\002dence depends only on the number of misses of c i against c j where j S i j\024j S j j  Therefore we can prune candidates earlier by considering the maximum number of hits as follows Example 5.1  Consider a matrix M as Fig 5 Since we do not count the number of misses between c i and c j such that j S i j  j S j j  we only maintain a miss counter from c 1 to c 2  If we want to extract 75%-or-more similar column pairs one miss is allowed between c 1 and c 2 At r 2 we initialize the miss counter for  c 1 c 2  to 0 Then at r 4 we check this candidate again 1 We should delete 1 Note that we could have deleted  c 1 c 2  at r 3 where c 2 has 1 but c 1 does not However in order to apply the maximum-hits pruning from a dense column c d to sparse columns c s from c 2 to c 1  in this example we have to check all candidate lists for sparse columns c s  which increases the computation time signi\002cantly Therefore we only apply the maximumhits pruning from a sparse column to dense columns

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
