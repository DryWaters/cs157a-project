155 programmers can enjoy the freedom of coding In a nutshell, with the development of IoT technology, traditional architecture can\222t meet the requirements of heterogeneous, interoper able, customizable and scalable systems. To deal with above challenges, we put forward an open IoT framework by decomposing IoT system into microservices to perform different kinds of tasks. By using message driven and registry/discovery mechanism in core service the framework can easily extend, evolve and integrate third party applications to support interoperability and scalability. Moreover, the system uses device plugins to shield the differ ences of hardware facilities in order to support more heterogeneous platforms. In particular as integrated with a series of microservices the framework delivers strong mechanism for fusing heterogeneous data through hierarchical preprocessing mass sensors data The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the related research about the archi tecture of monolithic and microservice of IoT application. Section 3 deals with the suggested microservice IoT system architecture. Section 4 presents how to implement the system and makes a comparison among the related IoT system. Finally, Section 5 presents a conclusion on the advantages and the limits of the micros ervice IoT system, and the future work  R  ORK The previous research of IoT system mainly includes two categories: monolithic and mi croservice architecture  In the monolithic architecture wa re  system is deployed as a single solution, in which functionally distinguishable aspects are all interwove The natural advantages of monolithic architecture are module inde pendent, uniform standards and technology stack. Many researches offer solutions from perspective of monolithic architecture. Earlier IoT studies mainly focus on hardware network power and business process to quickly interact with the physical entities across the business domains, even across the organizations based on the processing and integrating of distribut ed multisource sensing information. Because of the variety of business process, personal and physical entities involved, physical world continuously changes, IoT services are char acterized by real time changes. It brings new technical challenges to IoT services such as: heterogeneity of hardware, network and operating system, interoperability between applications and services, fusion of massive heterogeneous data, scalability and continuous integration Heterogeneity of hardware, network and operating system. Available IoT devices sensors and actuators\re vendors specific where the communication protocols and data exchange formats vary from device to device The complexity increases exponentially when simple devices are integrated to form a com plex network and it is difficult to provide a  Interoperability between applications and services. In the IoT application, many actors comprising human and nonhuman objects and  cations, adopting specific data standards and communication platforms. Different platforms lead to great inconvenience for achieving in teroperability and mutual communication in IoT applications Fusion of massive heterogeneous data While data collected in the IoT generates bil lion pieces of information with hundreds of data formats, it\222s hard to classify vast amount of raw data by a complex module in traditional architecture, and it also easily leads to system overload if a large number of redundant data directly goes to the application layer Scalability and continuous integration. IoT aims to keep on growing all the time and it has generated a lot of complex code. Devel opers with different technological skills often concern differently and everyone has their own limitations. So a good and independent architecture can offer a mechanism that the In this paper, a generic comparison between two architectures has been discussed. Based on these foundations the authors have pro posed a microservice system framework for the IoT

Any applicable tools and languages can quickly realize a specific ser vice. Compared with the traditional monolithic architecture, the microservice architecture has obvious advantages, such as complexity under control, independent deployment, more choic es for technology stack and fault tolerance which will facilitate the development of IoT applications on large scale Many researchers begin to provide IoT solution using microservice architecture. For example, Vresk and T  a microservice based architecture focusing on connecting with heterogeneous devices where the system confines to data model as pect.

However, the above mentioned microservice IoT systems only consider a spe  design a more generic and open framework in IoT system     The design of a new generation of IoT frame work considers the integration and reusability of existing information service system with high cohesion and loose coupling in open and scalable platform design. The core idea of the design is adopting the concept of microservice architecture, based on the analyse of the exist ing IoT system, reconstructing all the business functions of the system by decoupling them into independent and specific services. The design is using lightweight communication mechanism to interact between services with a and low-level software technol  instance, Wireless Sensor Networks \(WSN  approach of IoT but it has lim ited capacity and weak scalablity. To address these issues, some researches like ubiSOAP  W oT/SDN [6] focus on high-level IoT ap plication programming, which uses standard middleware to implement a layered communi cation. However, these systems are low reus ability and portability. TinySOA rvi l l a   Service Oriented Ar chitectures \(SOA  ferent applica-tions. To improve the scalablity of SOA, an Event-Driven SOA \(EDSOA\IoT technology [10] has also been put forward. In addition, OpenIoT [1 SOA, and implements Web of Things \(WoT However, with the increasing of the sys tem functions, the IoT becomes more and more complex in the distributed environment Monolithic architecture has some inevitable defects. First, the entire system is a united ap plication; only multiple deployments can im prove the system performance, while the over loaded functions create bottleneck, which is a waste of computing resources. Second, in the case of the change and evolution of the sys tem, a change in a function may affect other functions due to high dependencies. This also brings complexity for re-deployment, mainte nance and continuous integration. Finally, the whole system uses a sole technology stack and development standards, which in turn limits the methods to solve the problem of physical heterogeneity  To overcome the drawbacks of monolithic architecture, many researchers started to adopt   architecture is a new system software design pattern. It suggests that a single large and complex application should be divided into small manageable groups, where each group deals with the related services.

China Communications  February 2017 157 are wired together to provide a complete IoT platform. The design is consists of eight micro services and one core service coordinating with all, the microservices are as follows Geo, Security, Tenant, Devices, Bigdata, Automation, AI and Application. The system is not   to the applications requirements 1  The service is designed for organize devices by spatial correlation in order that the events of the devices can be gathered into groups in this way, such as location-aware devices. A Geo service provides GIS layer to implement map API for render  API to invoke map UI library and renders a layer or creates a layer dynamically 2 Security Microservice The service provides user/group/role management, authentication and authorization, access control, single sign-on and federation, identity governance and administration. It also supports security monitoring, reporting and auditing. User cre services. When performing create/update operations on entities, the access control policies of the authenticated user are stored to indicate which action can be performed by the user 3 Tenant Microservice Based on the multitenant design, the service provides support for multiple IoT applications by a single core service instance. An independent data store and processing pipeline is owned by each tenant, thus data and processing will not blended between tenants. Most components are also designed as multitenant enabled. This supports logic isolation of processing and data from different tenants 4  The device service manages various kinds of device plugins, and implements different communication protocols with low level hardware of how to collect data from sensors and execute command to actuators. This service provides interface for core service to invoke plugins callback. It uses metadata that contains extend context to specific device components. Based on speciminimal overload The proposed design uses a central service named as core service to control and coordinate the other microservice in the system; it is also used to bootstraps one or more tenant engines, which handle most of the other pro pattern to facilitate the access to object data and to support interoperability with other network. Core communication service encompasses the communication with the objects nodes between the microservices and external networks. It is provided by a broker micro service to provide asynchronous communication In the development of the communication  client applications  teract with microservices, the system also implements publish subscribe model to notify the clients about the interest events from their subscribed topics, where all the subscribed topics of a client would push the upcoming event notification on client side application From the core service broker, a client can subscribe multiple interest topics in order to  Fig 1 shows the architecture of proposed microservice IoT system.

The event manager is responsible for the communication among microservices and devices Core service is completely based on events any microservice interaction or any change in the environment will generate events. Events can be trapped by trigger when are published on channel. By defining in automation microservice, each trigger is linked to one or more commands. From this architecture, it follows that the program behavior is not predetermined but is fully modificable at runtime, making it  ble use in building automation Core service is provided by the following components, depicted in Fig. 2: BusMsgListener implements a series of bus listener routine which receives message from objects and sends it to its BusConsumer. MessageSubscriber subscribes/unsubscribes a message topic and registers on a channel. BusService provides convenience methods for sending or replying messages on a logic channel. Trigger  which subscribes through the channel. If the  trigger, it will invoke BehaviorManager which translates a generic request, one or more logic commands, into a series of hardware commands to ObjAction. Then these commands will be sent to the corresponding actuator automatically fications which contain device metadata and unique information like hardware identification, we can assign device plugins associated with physical objects. More details will be introduced in the following subsection 5 Bigdata Microservice The Bigdata service provides support for many kinds of scalable persistence to store data. It interacts with storage implementations by a consistent encapsulated API set. By this way, it is easy to add new storage technologies to the system When operating database, the system never directly manipulates database. On the contrary  perform data retrieving and storing 6 Automation Microservice The fundamental function is processing events generated by various event sources, analyses them and notifies appropriate participants according to the user specified queries. It supports events  dow function etc 7 Artifical Intelligence Microservice The AI service based on the IoT bigdata, provides  ing machine learning, data mining, graph computing, etc 8 Application Microservice This service provides components to support various client interaction interfaces, such as web UI, PC client or moblie app etc 9 Core service The core service provides support for data exchanging by message communication with the devices. The service uses broker to obtain/transform/preprocess messages that produces by objects. Data can be obtained from many sources including COAP AMQP, WebSockets, MQTT, socket connections, etc. Commands can be sent to devices with various protocols such as MQTT, COAP and other protocols. More details will be introduced in the following subsection  Core microservice is a very important microservice in this system, because we use it to handle all functions related to interacting with devices and related microservices.

In this system, each hardware device  be individually addressable. When a device  service network, a registration event will be triggered when establishing the connection with core service. Then the device microservice retrieves corresponding plugins and registers it to core service, in response, core service sends a message to the device service indicating the registration result After successful registration, devices can interchange various types of events to core service. These events may include: location updates, temperature, humidity and other data obtaining from the sensors, or alerts. Events are delivered to core service by means of plugins which provides a modular approach to support new functions for manipulating incoming data 3.Commands delivery Each hardware managed in a device service   commands corresponding to the devices.

Sensor and actuator plugins are tiny software package which can handle low level device communication and provide API to microservices. Each plugin is managed by device microservice and loaded and initialized automatically at system startup. The communication between the plugin and core microservice is automatically managed through message middleware. Device microservice mainly supports functions as following  Devices can be manually created by means of API calls or by self-registration.

It fully supports continuous delivery and development technology  C  ORK In this paper, we propose a new microservice IoT framework that has improved features than existing IoT system such as: monolithic and microserivce system. The proposed sys tem provides a more generic microservice IoT architecture on a module approach, it is much better than existing approaches in terms of flexibility, scalability and platform indepen dency. In addition, we have also introduced the functions of the key components and il lustrated their applications. In the proposed microservice IoT framework, all IoT devices and objects are abstracted as resource plugin inside the system The allocation of microservices to devices works dynamically by interacting with core ser vice, where the core service interacts with the device by using the related plugins, the device plugins can be mounted or unmounted dynami cally, upgradation of the plugins is also possible without affecting the overall system, or even the whole module of a microservice can be freely replaced. Thus, the system not only pro vides the best IoT service but also has a good support for the Web of Things and has stronger adaptability, scalability and interoperability For the practice of microservice architec ture, there are still many problems to be stud ied, such as cooperative transaction process ing, network delay, faults in network, message serialization and other issues.

R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  TABLE 4 Features that describes student and system interaction P2AI Component The core of the P2AI component relies on the H2O DLANNs algorithm which is based on a multi-layer feed forward ANNs that are trained using back-propagation 050BP\051 with stochastic-gradient descent We divided dataset into two parts 60 for training and 40 for testing We performed 400 iterations with two hidden layers each containing 800 neurons For testing the P2AI Component we have used a real dataset av ailable online by edX published in 2014 The major feature of this data is that it describes de gree of interaction between the student and edX The edX online education entity is a massive open online course 050MOOC\051 provider founded in year 2012 by the collaborative efforts of Harvard and MIT It offers high quality online courses that are delivered and designed by some of the best minds around the world The edX data that we used contained a large number of missing values We therefore discarded rows which had more than four missing columns i.e the columns which were related to our analysis containing students eventbased records describing student and system interaction 050Data Cleansing Fig 17\051 Further we imputed missing values using MICE Subsequently  we selected a sub set of attrib utes which are most relevant by using RF generated feature importance A subset of these selected features only those that describe student and system interaction are listed in Table 4 Using the selected features data we performed predictions based on the certi\034ed attribute 050not mentioned in the table\051 with class label of 1 for certi\034ed 050successful\051 students and 0 for unsuccessful students B RESULTS The results related to the student performance obtained through the P2AI Component prototype are depicted in Fig 19 The 034gure plots the number of times the student population interacted with the edX The student population is separated into two groups the students who gained upto 50 marks 050depicted by the yellow color bars\051 and those who gained between 51 to 100 marks 050depicted by the blue color bars\051 The average number of times the student population interacted with edX are plotted in four different categories Average videos played average chapters read average activities and average events 050see Fig 19 A clear message FIGURE 19 Students scores against different type and number of inte-ractions with UTiLearn FIGURE 20 The classification error plot of the P2AI algorithm from the 034gure is that the students who received higher marks 050blue bars\051 interacted with the system signi\034cantly higher number of times 0503239 vs 1051\051 than those who received lower marks 050yellow bars\051 We could evidently imply that a student's marks are directly proportional to the number of times the student interacts 050uses the course content\051 with the system Fig 20 The classi\034cation error plot of the P2AI algorithm Fig 20 depicts the accuracy of the DLANN prediction algorithm 050see Fig 18\051 in terms of the classi\034cation error It shows a very small error 050the y-axis scale is very small\051 The algorithm achieved a 99.83 classi\034cation accuracy a 0.0018 mean square error 050MSE\051 and a 0.0427 root mean square error 050RMSE\051 These are relatively high accuracies achieved by the use of DLANNs algorithm though as mentioned earlier it incurs high computational costs 050see IX DISCUSSION CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK The education industry around the globe is undergoing major transformations MOOC organisations such as Coursera Khan Academy are advancing new business models for education Several major industries have dropped university degrees from the requirements for job applicants Industry is increasingly focusing on nurturing speci\034c skills in the workforce as opposed to or in addition to a university degree The economics of higher education institutions VOLUME 5 2017 2631 
 


R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  are under threat in a continuing gloomy global economy while digital and lifelong learners are increasingly demanding new T&L paradigms There is a clear and urgent need to transform teaching and learning landscape in order to drive global economic growth The use of distance eTeaching and eLearning 050DTL\051 is on the rise among digital natives alongside our evolution towards smart societies However the DTL systems today lack the necessary sophistication due to several challenges including data analysis and management learner-system interactivity system cognition resource planning agility and scalability We also discussed the developments around future cities and smart societies and highlighted the fundamental need of developing knowledge and human and social capital for their enablement It was discussed that smart society developments would extend the role of learning from mainstream education for employment scope to the notion of social and collaborative governance where the society will collaborate to train each other in maintaining its knowledge moral 034ber good practice resilience competitiveness and for bringing innovation and becoming a knowledge-based economy The key to such efforts would be a converged ubiquitous infrastructure comprising many systems that share information among them and collaborate with each other as necessary We felt motivated by the challenges and opportunities surrounding the education industry and digital learners as well as the developments in urbanisation and proposed in this paper a Ubiquitous eTeaching  eLearning 050UTiLearn\051 Framework UTiLearn leveraged IoT big data supercomputing deep learning mobile computing and cloud computing to provide enhanced development management and delivery of teaching and learning in future city and smart society settings UTiLearn framework provides an environment and ecosystem for societies to enrich their knowledge anytime anywhere any age through improved processes for collection development accessibility pedagogy and cognition of knowledge Its users could be teachers students governments 050such as for cloud-based healthcare systems 101]\051 b usinesses third parties and virtual organisations or groups formed for speci\034c purposes A learner may register her preferences and the system advises her through to the completion of the learning task In addition to the usual functions of an MOOC a government department can develop speci\034c material to reach out to a group of people to create awareness of a topic for social intervention purposes The UTiLearn framework can run in a cloud and can be offered as a service UTLaaS A proof of concept implementation of the UTiLearn framework called the UTiLearn system comprising 034ve components was developed in the paper The 034ve components were described in details along with their functions methodologies algorithms implementation as well as their evaluation We used 11 widely used datasets for system evaluation The R statistical platform was used for the data analysis data quality management prediction and decision making The methods used included Na\357ve Bayes classi\034er Random Forest and DLANNs The experiments were carried out on the supercomputer Aziz Future work will focus on building additional capacity of the UTiLearn system in terms of the quality and functionality of the processes used in the various components of the system data quality management extension of big data related functionalities and IoT related functionalities A major issue in designing a real life UTiLearn system would be its data and information management We could bene\034t by the research and practice on designing sustainable enterprise information systems Our earlier work in this respect 103 would form the basis of our future direction on extending information management aspects of the UTiLearn system Another major issue in a scalable design of the UTiLearn system would be to deal with big data and computational load related issues Our research direction in this respect will rely on modelling analysis and design methods that leverage HPC technologies and are able to deal with big data such as our earlier work in and 10 5 The w ork on the UARI component in this paper has revealed that the human activity datasets available online are limited in their quality and extent We believe that in the future many more detailed and high quality datasets will be available to allow a better understanding of human activities across space and time Moreover systems like UTiLearn can record the activity data of the users and buildup its own datasets over time to have a better understanding of human activities to allow better optimisation of pedagogy human cognition delivery mode selections and required application traf\034c and network characteristics Additional work is also needed in 034nding and incorporating networking applications and system workload related datasets to be used in the SNPDP Component These are required to enhance the precision of the training computation and prediction of networking characteristics application traf\034c models and system models In this respect our earlier work on city transportation modelling evacuation and telematics such as in  w ould be useful both from activity recognition and learning point of view That is information learning and entertainment would be integrated and system optimization would bene\034t from all kinds of 050big\051 data Finally the use of computational and arti\034cial intelligence and human-machine interaction demands a careful look at the design of UTiLearn and similar systems There is need to consider the theory and practice of sociotechnical systems  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The experiments reported in this paper were performed on the Aziz supercomputer at KAU The authors
