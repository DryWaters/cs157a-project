RELATED WORK\nTraditional access control models such as Role Based\nAccess Control \(RBAC authorization. In general these models\nclassify prede?ned users for access control. But, the notion of\nunknown user in access control cannot be addressed by these\nmodels. Hence, trust based access control that extended the\nRBAC models [18] [23] were introduced to address the fact\nthat not all characteristics of a user are known in advance.\nResearchers have extended these to accommodate context\ninformation such as time and location [4 13] [5]. However,\nthese models generally do not hold good for P2P networks\nwith its decentralized nature.\nUsing trust in P2P computer networks has been an ac-\ntive research topic. Many models have been proposed which\naddress better routing [16] [14], malicious nodes elimination\nand providing incentives for being well-behaved nodes [2],\naggregating recommendations in the absence of direct trust\n[17]. Disposition to trust [19] and subjectivity of trust [3] have\nalso been addressed.\nIn [14], encounters in mobile societies are used to build\nproximity, location and similarity based trust. Trust thus built\nis made use of, to better route the messages from P2P. Effect\nof sel?shness and unreachability is largely shown to reduce in\na network. This routing, though involving trust built between\npeers, will not be applicable completely to a situation where\nthere are no hops involved and sel?shness, better message\nrouting and malicious nodes in a network routing will not\nneed to be addressed. [2] proposes a model built on reputation\nand trust. Providing good peers with incentives in the form\nof increasing their trust and blacklisting misbehaving peers,\nthereby keeping them out of the network has been proposed.\nPeer selection strategy provides a way in which misbehaving\npeers can be removed from the network. In [17] proposed\ntrust-management scheme M-trust aggregates distributed trust\nrating, wherein trust ratings are acquired from direct and\nwitness recommendations from various nodes. M-trust was\nshown to be better in terms of reliability and accuracy of\naggregation while being light-weight and robust in comparison\nto techniques such as weighted average of ratings, Bellman-\nford algorithm [6] among others. In [3], trust model for mobile\nAd-Hoc networks has been proposed. The notion of ignorance\namong peers has been expressed as uncertainty and the known\ncharacteristics are divided into belief and disbelief. Direct,\nobserved and recommended opinions among peers is used to\nbuild trust among peers Disposition to trust is addressed in\n[19], which has a strong in?uence on how direct trust and\ntransitive trust is assessed among peers. Rather than assigning\ntrust values to each node/peer, the nodes are sorted in the order\nof their trustworthiness giving rise to a trust set of nodes. This\nFig. 1. Trust Calculation In?uence\nmodel is particularly useful for calculating transitive trust as\nthe trust values assigned to a peer is subjective and dependent\non the disposition to trust of the evaluating peer.\nTrust based access control among P2P network in mobile\ndevices has been addressed in [24]. A ?le can be accessed by a\npeer when it satis?es the minimum trust threshold for accessing\nthat ?le. Trust is calculated by using direct interactions or by\nusing indirect recommendation in its absence. Transactions are\nrated for their satisfaction from user In this model, access is\ncontrolled on a ?le to ?le basis. It is not only time consuming\nfor the end user to set threshold values for each ?le but also\nvery dif?cult to manage with the current volumes of data being\nshared among peers over a P2P network.\nA framework for P2P content sharing on smartphones is\nproposed 25]. Files are partitioned and shared using Bluetooth\ntransport, popularly available in most smartphones Trust is not\nthe driver of P2P content sharing in this model.\nHence, to address these shortcomings, we propose a model\nthat controls access to categories of ?les based on trust among\npeers. Using the features of smartphones such as NFC and\nBluetooth, proposed model is viable for adaption.\nIII. PROPOSED MODEL\nUnlike client/server systems where the machines and users\nare tightly bound, and the users characteristics and information\nare known in advance, in P2P model, the client peer \(one who\nrequests for information/?les host peer \(one who provides\nthe requested information/?les is known in advance about the characteristic\nof each other. With no central authority to control access and\nprovide authorizations like in RBAC [18] [23], access control\npolicies have to be dynamic enough to accommodate this\ndecentralized model of working.\nAccess control policies based on trust have been generally\ndesigned to control who can access the ?les that are shared\namong peers [24] [25] [15]. But, very few have attempted\nto answer the question “who can access what”in the area of\nmobile P2P networks. It is generally assumed that all content\nis accessible to all peers provided their trust value matches the\nminimum threshold range.\nWe propose a model which answers “who can access\nwhat”. Based on the overall trust value calculated, categories\nare made available for access to peers. Trust value is calculated\nbased on the weight 


assigned to the accessed category and\nweight assigned to the context of the historical transactions.\nIn turn the calculated trust in?uences the category’s that can\n240\nFig. 2. Architecture diagram\nbe accessed in the current transaction’s context \(Fig 1 traditionally been accessing in the past. The motivation\nbehind this is to continue to provide access to peers based\non what they were allowed to access historically. Thus, the\ntrust value will never rise beyond the trust requirement of the\naccessed categories. Client peer will not know the contents of\nother categories with higher trust requirements than its own\ntrust value.\nAll ?les to be shared among peers are grouped into\ncategories Files with similar access level are grouped into\nsame category. These categories can be activated based on the\ntrust value of the client device. The trust value required to\naccess each category varies based on the context in which\nthey are trying to be accessed. Each category can be accessed\nwhen the trust value of the client device satis?es the minimum\ntrust value requirement.\nContext of the transaction in?uences what content is shared\namong peers. Based on the context of the current transaction,\nsensitive ?les may not be shared Context is a quantitative way\nof weighting the vulnerability in surrounding environment of\nthe transaction With increase in vulnerability, trust require-\nment to access categories will also increase. Fig. 2 gives the\ndetailed architecture diagram of the proposed model.\nA. Authentication\nAuthentication occurs at the beginning of a transaction. In\nour framework, peer uses a Unique Identi?er \(UID International Mobile Station Equipment Identity\n\(IMEI of Public/Private keys. A peer gives UID and Public key\nas its identi?er and uses Private keys for its authentication.\nUpon receiving a request for communication from a client\npeer, host peer checks its database for any transaction history\nstored against client peer using UID; if the database entry is\nabsent a new database entry is created, else transaction history\nis retrieved. The database containing historical information\nmay shed records on in-active peers and historical transactions\nbeyond a threshold age of transactions, from time to time.\nCategories Rcatx Catx Trust\nRange\nAdjusted\nWeight\nWeights\n\(Wcai Highest\nWork Docs 4 0.8 0.6-0.8 0.6-0.85 0.6\nFamily Photos 3 0.6 0.4-0.6 0.4-0.6 0.4\nFriends Photos 2 0.4 0.2-0.4 0.2-0.4 0.2\nMusic, Videos 1 0.2 0-0.2 0.05-0.2 0.05 Lowest\nTABLE 1\nEXAMPLE CATEGORIES SET\nB Categories\nIn our model, all the content is attached to categories.\nCategories can be considered as virtual containers of ?les\nthat need to be shared among peers. Instead of controlling\naccess to each ?le or a set of les, the access control is\ndesigned to control access to categories. Files with similar\ntrust requirements are attached to one category. A ?le can\nbelong to more than one category. It is notable that weights\nare assigned based on category accessed and not ?le accessed.\nConsider a situation of sharing “Music ?les”and Family\nphotos”. We would want to share family photos with only\nvery close friends or family members unlike music ?les that\ncan be shared with an acquaintance too. Trust value required\nto access family photos would be higher than the trust value\nrequirement for music ?les. Hence, group family photos into a\ncategory “Family Photo category”and music ?les into “Music\n?les category”. By designing access control policies around\ncategories instead of individual ?le access or individual user\naccess, addition and deletion of ?les is simple to handle.\nEach category’s trust requirement varies based on the\nsensitivity of the ?les it houses Categories are hierarchically\narranged and assigned numerical ranking RCatx to denote the\nsensitivity and trust requirement of the contained ?les. Weights\nare assigned by dividing the trust range [0, 1] by the number\nof categories Catnum\nCatx = \(\n1\nCatnum\n Catx\nMinimum in the trust range = Maximum in the trust range of\nthe previous category in hierarchy Wcai\nMinimum and Maximum values in trust range can be\nadjusted by the user. It is the minimum in the trust range\nthat is assigned as weight of the category at the end of each\ntransaction, since minimum value in the range is good enough\nto access the category.\nConsider an example category set as shown in Table 1. For\nthe sake of simplicity we have considered all transactions to be\n?le transfers even though transfer of contacts business cards,\nmessages can all be supported by this model.\nThe weights assigned Wcai denoting the weight of ith\ncategory is a value in the range of [0,1] i.e., Wcai ? [0,1]\nwith values nearer to 1 denoting a higher trust requirement\nto access them and a value nearer to 0 denoting less trust\nrequirement to access them.\n241\nContext RCntx Cntx Trust\nRange\nAdjusted\nWeight\nWeights\n\(Wctj 0.8-1.00 0.8 Highest\nOf?ce 3 0.75 0.5-0.75 0.5-0.8 0.5\nHome 2 0.5 0.25-0.5 0.2-0.5 0.2\nPrivate 1 0.25 0-0.25 0.05-0.2 0.05 Lowest\nTABLE 2\nEXAMPLE CONTEXT SET\nC. Contexts\nContext-aware computing is a mobile computing paradigm.\nContexts are a part of most enterprise level access control\nsystems designed using Role Based Access Control [4] [13]\n[5]. Context awareness adds extra dimension to the access\ncontrol. Context can be User Pro?le, Location, Social situation,\nTime of day/month/year. In our model we consider Pro?le and\nTime-Location 


as the major contextual features as they are\nrelevant to the mobile P2P environment. Context awareness\nenables mobile devices to anticipate user needs and act in\nadvance. Context provides vulnerability information of the\nsurrounding environment for data transfer between peers.\nA pro?le is a set of settings in a mobile device that is\ngrouped together. A pro?le can be activated based on the\ncontextual information such as location time, light [20] [26].\nTime-Location pair is context information that can be\nderived through sensors [8] [1 Trust requirement changes\nbased on the Time-Location awareness; the categories that\ncan be accessed with a certain trust level may or may not\nbe accessible in other Time-location.\nContext thus derived can be grouped into different levels,\nwhich are hierarchically arranged based on the trust require-\nment of each context level. The calculation is similar to\ncategory weight calculation.\nCntx = \(\n1\nCntnum\n the number of contexts and RCntx\ngives the hierarchical ranking of contexts. Maximum trust\nvalue in the trust range of a context = Cntx Minimum in\nthe trust range = Maximum in the trust range of the previous\ncontext in hierarchy = Wctj . Minimum and Maximum values\nin trust range can be adjusted by the user and minimum in the\ntrust range is assigned as context weight, Wctj .\nConsider an example context set as shown in Table 2 The\ntable denotes the weights required to access information from\nhost peer under particular contexts. The weights assigned Wctj\ndenoting the weight of jth category is a value in the range of\n[0,1] i.e., Wctj ? [0,1 with values nearer to 1 denoting a\nhigher trust requirement to access them and a value nearer to\n0 denoting less trust requirement to access them.\nD. Qualitative grouping\nTrust can be quanti?ed in the range [-1, 1] as in [21]. Trust\nhas been quanti?ed to be in the range [0, 1] in [24] [18] [23].\nIn [11], trust is quanti?ed in the range of 1 to 10. Trust can be\nquanti?ed and modeled to suit the requirements of the model\nQualitative Label Trust Range Modi?ed trust range\nMin 0-0.2 0.05-0.15\nBelow Average 0.2-0.4 0.15-0.4\nAverage 0.4-0.6 0.4-0.6\nAbove Average 0.6-0.8 0.6-0.85\nMax 0.8-1 0.85-1\nTABLE 3\nQUALITATIVE LABELS WITH RANGE VALUES\nbeing designed. Another approach is to use the qualitative label\nto represent Trust.\nIn our model, we group trust range into qualitative labels.\nThe rationale behind this is to de?ne one qualitative label\nthat can house a range of trust values. Based on the number\nof past transactions and the weights assigned to quantify the\nrecent past transactions against distant past transactions, the\nactual trust value will vary, even though the category’s being\naccessed over time is the same. Hence, it would be ideal to\ndivide the trust range [0, 1 into strata’s and de?ne a label\nfor each stratum. Qualitative labels are easier to specify and\nmanage.\nLet Qn denote the number of qualitative labels and Gp\ndenote the range/gap between levels.\nQn =\n1\nGp\nAnalysis: Let’s analyze the strategy, by assigning Gp=0.2.\nWe get Qn = 10.2 = 5\nLet the labels be de?ned as in Table 3.\nFrom the Table 3, we can see the distribution of trust values\nover different qualitative labels. Modi?ed trust range indicates\nthat the values need not be ?xed but is at the discretion of\nthe host, who can modify the range values. Thus, the trust\nvalues calculated falls into one of these trust range labels. A\nchange in the trust range will not warrant a change of access\ncontrol. It is essential to note that the Qualitative labels are just\nlabels and do not add any extra layer of complexity into the\nmodel. Also, the Qualitative labels are arranged hierarchically\nand a peer who falls into “Above Average”bucket will have\nall the categories accessible for P2P ?le transfer with a trust\nrequirement lesser than “Above Average”; only categories\nbelonging to “Max”will be inaccessible.\nE. Access Control\nCategory is hierarchically de?ned based on the trust re-\nquirement. So is Context. But, when both of them are com-\nbined, they give rise to a matrix which de?nes the trust\nrequirements of categories in particular contexts. Consider the\nexamples of Table 1 and Table 2 extended to a matrix as shown\nin Table 4.\nBased on the de?ned hierarchy, the trust levels can be\nautomatically assigned to the categories in a particular context,\nas in “Public”context in Table 4. This automatic assignment\nmay not suit in all circumstances, as the access control of\nmany category-context pairs may overlap. Also, user may want\nto override the assignment as he is more aware of the ?le\n242\nContext Public Of?ce Home Private\nCategories\nMusic, Videos Min Min Min Min\nFriends Photos Below Average Average Min Min\nFamily Photos Average Above Average Min Min\nWork Docs Above Average Min Average Min\nPersonal Photos Max Max Above Average Above Average\nTABLE 4\nEXAMPLE ACCESS CONTROL MATRIX USING QUALITATIVE LABELS\nclassi?cation into categories and also about the context in\nwhich they will be accessed. Hence, the automatic association\ncan be overridden by the user to modify the trust requirements\nas shown under “Of?ce”, “Home”and Private”Contexts in\nTable 4.\nAnalysis: Consider “Public”context for analysis of access. The\nstarting trust requirement is “Max”for accessing “Personal\nPhotos”in the “Public”context. The next in hierarchy is Above\nAverage”that is associated with “Work Docs”and so on. Since,\n“Music and Videos”can be shared even with an acquaintance,\nit has the lowest access control requirement even under higher\ntrust requiring context Public”.\nIV. TRUST EVALUATION\nHuman interaction occurring through trust is cognitive in\nnature. To utilize the concept of trust for modeling requires\ntrust to be quanti?able to a numerical value.\nTrust can be 


calculated based on the direct interaction\nexperiences between peers over a period of time. But, to\nestablish trust in peers who are communicating for the ?rst\ntime, the notion of transitive trust can be used. i.e., Peer A\nand peer B have an established interaction history and so do\npeer B and peer C. The past interaction experience between\npeer B and peer C can be used for establishing communication\nbased on trust between peer A and peer C. In our model we\nuse quanti?ed trust, calculated based on the past interaction\nhistory to provide access to categories of ?les.\nInteraction history is a rich source of information that can\nbe utilized to calculate trust for the current interaction. It\nprovides information about context, any failures unexpected\nbehaviors or attacks. This can be used to model and decide\nwhether the current interaction poses any threat and what\ncategories of information can be shared. If multiple categories\nare accessed in a single transaction, the trust value stored in\nhistorical records is the hierarchically higher placed category\ntrust value. Context information is also stored. The calculated\ntrust, along with context information in the form of a recom-\nmendation certi?cate, is digitally signed by the private key of\nthe host peer and issued to the client peer in the form of Rating\nCerti?cate.\nA. Direct Trust Calculation\nConsider a set of categories represented by the set\n\(ca1, ca2, ca3, ....cai ct1, ct2, ct3 ctj access it. Let Wctj be the\nweight assigned to ctjth context to denote the trustworthiness\ncoef?cient required to access it. Let \(t1, t2, t3, ....tk transfer\nfrom caith category in ctjth context from host peer Ph to the\nclient peer Pc.\nTo calculate the trust value host peer has on the client\npeer in the context ctj we calculate the trust value derived\nout of each transaction \(tk value\n\(Tctj tk t1, t2, t3, ....tk tk is calculated as -\ntk =\n2×Wcai×Wctj\nWcai+Wctj\nIn real world, transactions that occurred in the near past\nare weighed higher than the transactions that occurred in the\ndistant past. To accommodate this, we introduce a non-negative\nweight Wk as described in [18]. Wk is the weight assigned to\nthe kth interval such that Wk W\(k?1 on the proximity of the past transactions\ncompletion time to the current time.\nThe assumption is that each transaction occurs at time in-\nstances. The function TT, referred to as transaction-occurrence-\ntime function returns the time instance tmb at which a\ngiven transaction ek was completed. Hence, TT\(ek ek tmb and tmb ? [tma, tmc] and tmb = tma?tmb =\ntmc, then ek is considered to have occurred in the interval\n[tma, tmc]. Consider two consecutive intervals [tma, tmb]\nand [tmb, tmc], if TT\(ek we assume ek\noccurs in the interval [tma, tmb].\nWe refer the readers to [18] for more information regarding\nthis weight assignment Wk.\nIncorporating the weight assigned Wk into our model, tk\nis the trust contribution to the overall trust calculation\ntk =\ntk\n\(\ntk\nWk\n n?n\nk=1 tk?n\nk=1\(\ntk\nWk\n peer Pc based on the past transactions\nin that particular context ctj\nAnalysis: Category weight and context weights are the\ndriving factors in the calculation of trust tk of each transaction.\nThe motivation to assign category and context weights is the\nfact that we would want to share only some categories with\npeers under speci?c contexts based on their trust values. Hence,\nit is imperative that these satis?ed transactions wherein speci?c\ncategories are accessed, should drive the future access of the\ncategories in those contexts. In effect if the current transac-\ntion was not satisfactory, the future access to the categories\naccessed in the current transaction will be in-limbo. With\nunsatis?ed or malicious behaviour of the peer, trust value of\n243\nthe transaction would be 0. With continued bad behaviour, the\npeer will be added to Blacklist. This drives or motivates the\nclient peer to be a good transaction partner.\nWith each satis?ed transaction, the categories accessed\nin the particular context together drive the transactions trust\nvalue. As the number of satis?ed transactions from host peer\nto client peer increases over time, the trust value does not\nincrease beyond the trust value which de?nes the trust level\nfor accessing the categories.\nConsider a trust level of “Above Average”that is required\nto access a category cai under context ctj for analysis.\nLet the trust value of category cai be in the range of [0.6,\n0.8] and context ctj also be in the range of [0.6, 0.8]. Thus,\nthe trust value tk of each transaction in these circumstances\nwill be in the range of [0.6, 0.8]. Let the range of [0.6 0.8]\ndenote trust level group “Above Average”, to which the client\npeer Pc belongs to. With each satis?ed transaction, the total\ntrust value Tctj will continue to be in the range of [0.6, 0.8]\nindicating that the trust level group which the client peer Pc\nis a part of will not change. This implies that the client peer\nPc cannot climb up the ladder of Trustworthiness and reach a\ntrust level group above “Above Average”.\nThe motivation behind using category weight and context\nweight to drive the trust value is the fact that, no 


matter how\nmany times a client peer accesses a category, he should not\nbe able to increase a trust value beyond the range of the\ncategory-context trust requirements. The categories which are\ninaccessible to the client peer should remain so, no matter the\nnumber of satisfactory transactions.\nConsider a student trying to access music and videos from\nhis professor. Music has the lowest trust requirement. No\nmatter the number of successful transactions, he should not be\nable to access professors contacts, photos and such sensitive\ncategories. The only way to access them may be at home with\nthe same lesser trust requirement, but student will not be able\nto visit professors home and thus will not be able to access\nthe sensitive categories.\nThus, the client peer can access other categories under\ncircumstances as listed –\n1 sensitive categories in contexts that\nrequire lesser trust value\n2 to host\npeer Ph and known to client peer Pc about its\nrecommendation to increase its trustworthiness value\ngrouping. “known”here means there has been a his-\ntory of transactions between them. The client peer\ncan explicitly request for the recommendations to be\nconsidered to increase its qualitative grouping stand-\ning when the client peer is aware that the information\nrequired by it is in one of the inaccessible categories\nand hence, it needs to climb up the qualitative group\nhierarchy\nB. Indirect Trust calculation through Recommendation\nIn our model, communication occurs from host peer to\nclient peer only. Only two parties are involved in the transac-\ntion. To calculate indirect trust we consider recommendation\nFig. 3. Indirect trust between host peer H and client peer C through\nrecommendation from peer R\nfrom a recommender with whom host peer and client peer\nboth have interacted previously. The ?ow of recommendation\nis from recommendation provider to the requester with no hops\ninvolved. We follow the indirect trust calculation method as in\n[24 and modify it to suit our model.Since the indirect trust\nis a product of trust between the recommender peer and the\nhost peer, involving multiple hops leads to deriving insignif-\nicant trust values and is often complex and computationally\nexpensive.\nIndirect trust of Host peer Ph on Client peer Pc, \(Fig. 3 recommendation from peer Pr is calculated as:\nIThc =\n\(\n?x\nr=1 Thr×Trc has on Pc. Thr is the\ntrust Ph has on recommender Pr in the context similar to\ncurrent transaction context and Trc is the trust recommender\nPr has on peer Pc in the context similar to current transaction\ncontext. x is the number of recommendations that are requested\nby Ph from Pc. x can vary based on the context of the current\ntransaction. If the supplied number of recommendations is\nless than x, the division is still by x giving a much lesser\ntrust value. If Pc has interacted with greater number of peers,\nit is reasonable to expect it will be a trusted peer. Also,\nby varying the value of x, Ph has control over the number\nof recommendations that it expects, based on the context of\ncurrent transaction.\nRecommender Pr should have interaction history with Ph\nin a context similar to current transaction context. The value\nof Indirect trust thus derived will be in the range of [0, 1].\nBased on the calculated trust value, client peer is added to one\nof the Qualitative label buckets.\nC. Rating Certi?cate\nIn the absence of direct transactions, a rating certi?cate\nis sought by the host peer from client peer to prove its\ntrustworthiness. A rating certi?cate is thus a means to deliver\nrecommendation. A rating certi?cate contains the trust value\nof the client peer as calculated by host peer at the beginning\nof the transaction and is issued at the end of the transaction.\nIt is the obligation of the recommender to hold a copy of the\ncerti?cate issued for future reference in case of a dispute or\nfor veri?cation.\nWith a digitally signed rating certi?cate \(Fig 4 Sample recommendation certi?cate\n1 help of digital sig-\nnature\n2 provide its recommendation\n3 certi?cate cannot be used\nand will need to be reissued by the recommender with the\ntrust value re-calculated at the time of certi?cate issue.\nD. Entering into trust relationship with host peer\nA new peer who wishes to communicate with a host peer\ncan obtain recommendation from one of the recommender peer\nwho is known to both A new acquaintance who cannot obtain\na recommendation or a peer who became an acquaintance to\nthe host peer recently and wishes to access ?les from host\npeer can be added and assigned the lowest trust value in the\nhierarchy\(eg., 0.05 and over time, be able to access other categories\nthrough building trust and obtaining recommendations.\nE Attacks visited\nTrust based access control is susceptible to the same attacks\nthat trust based P2P communication is prone to. Some of the\nknown attacks are collusion attacks [9], Sybil attack [10], On-\noff attacks [22] and spoo?ng attacks [7]. We explain how\nthe features of the proposed model provide suf?cient defense\nagainst these attacks.\nCollusion attacks - Peers can collude and provide either\nhigh or low recommendations to each other. Thus, they can\nin?uence a peers trust value with other peers. Peers who rst\nbuild trust and then turn malicious to provide positive recom-\nmendations to other malicious peers are 


hard to recognize and\ndefend against. To counter this, sensitive information should\nbe categorized carefully and allowed to be accessed only after\npeer attains the trust value and continue to hold that trust value\nfor certain period of time. This proves quite expensive and\nacts as a deterrent to the malicious nodes, as they need to\nobtain trust value and continue to hold that trust value for a\ncertain period of time to be able to successfully turn malicious.\nIntroducing this time factor should be carefully considered as\nit is expensive to both host peer and any good peer that needs\nto access sensitive information legitimately.\nOn-off attacks On-off attacks are characterized by peers\nbehaving well and badly alternatively. This can be effectively\ndefended against by blacklisting the peer, the very ?rst time,\nthey involve in malicious activity By imposing harsher restric-\ntions and reducing their trust value signi?cantly, such peers\nwill not be tempted to behave badly again.\nIdentity based attacks – Sybil attacks and spoo?ng attacks\ncan be classi?ed as identity based attacks characterized by\na single user using different identities and pretending to be\nmultiple distinct individuals. Trust based peer to peer commu-\nnication is particularly prone to these attacks due to the fact\nthat recommendation is a part of trust based communication.\nThe ?rst line of defense against these attacks should be in\nverifying that an individual cannot successfully attain multiple\nidentities. By hashing the IMEI of the mobile device to obtain\nunique identity, it is hard to obtain multiple identities.\nV ALGORITHMS\nA.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nWe have proposed a P2P access control model for smart-\nphones based on trust. Trust is derived based on direct inter-\naction of the host peer with the client peer. In the absence of\ndirect interaction, trust is calculated using recommendations.\nWe have proposed a novel way of computing trust values using\nweights assigned to categories and contexts. Similar ?les are\ngrouped into categories that are virtual containers. This is a\nmanageable, ?exible and effective way of access control of\nlarge number of ?les. Access to these categories is controlled\nby trust value.\nFlexibility of adjusting the values, by the user, is at two\nlevels - lower level being the trust range modi?cation and the\nhigher level being at the access control.\nOur future work involves implementing the proposed model\nusing Bluetooth and NFC. We would also like to address a\ngeneralized approach among peers, for dividing the time into\ntime intervals and assigning weights based on their nearness\nto the current transaction. With this generalized approach,\ntrust values derived from recommendations will lead to higher\naccuracy.\nREFERENCES\n[1 G. D. Abowd, A. K. Dey, P. J. Brown, N. Davies, M. Smith, and\nP. Steggles.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A. White is the Executive Director of the Brain Institute and a USTAR Professor nof Bioengineering and Neuroscience at the University of Utah.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
