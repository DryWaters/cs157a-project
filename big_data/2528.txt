Distributed k-means Clustering with Low Transmission Cost\nMurilo Coelho Naldi\nDepartment of Exact and Technological Sciences\nFederal University of Vic¸osa - UFV\nRio Parana?´ba, Brazil\nmurilocn@ufv.br\nRicardo Jose´ Gabrielli Barreto Campello\nInstitute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences\nUniversity of Sa˜o Paulo USP\nSa˜o Carlos, Brazil\ncampello@icmc.usp.br\nAbstract—Dealing with big amounts of data is one of the\nchallenges for clustering, which causes the need for distribution\nof large data sets in separate repositories. However, most\nclustering techniques require the data to be centralized. One\nof them, the k-means, has been elected one of the most\nin?uential data mining algorithms. Although exact distributed\nversions of the k-means algorithm have been proposed, the\nalgorithm is still sensitive to the selection of the initial\ncluster prototypes and requires that the number of clusters\nbe speci?ed in advance Additionally, distributed versions of\nclustering algorithms usually requires multiple rounds of data\ntransmission. This work tackles the problem of generating\nan approximated model for distributed clustering, based on\nk-means, for scenarios where the number of clusters of the\ndistributed data is unknown and the data transmission rate is\nlow or costly. A collection of algorithms is proposed to combine\nk-means clustering for each distributed subset of the data with a\nsingle round of communication. These algorithms are compared\nfrom two perspectives: the theoretical one, through asymptotic\ncomplexity analyses; and the experimental one, through a\ncomparative evaluation of results obtained from experiments\nand statistical tests.\nKeywords-clustering; k-means; distributed data sets; low data\ntransfer;\nI. INTRODUCTION\nData clustering aims at determining a ?nite set of cate-\ngories to describe a data set according to similarities among\nits objects, having broad applicability in areas that range\nfrom image and market segmentation to document catego-\nrization and bioinformatics \(e.g. see [1 growth of data gen-\nerated in many ?elds over the years. This growth requires the\ndistribution of large data sets in separate repositories, also\ncalled data sites. In many scenarios, the data are naturally\ndistributed i.e., have been generated and stored in different\ndata sites. Large distributed data sets demand computational\ntechniques that are able to extract relevant information with\ngood computational performance and scalability. In order to\naccomplish these requirements, low data transmission cost is\nalso necessary. However most clustering techniques require\nthe data to be centralized, which may not be feasible in many\ncases due to computational limitations.\nAmong many clustering algorithms proposed in the lit-\nerature, k-means has been elected one of the top ten most\nin?uential data mining algorithms for being simple, scalable\nand easy to adapt for different application domains [2].\nHowever, it is sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster\nprototypes and requires that the number of clusters, ?, be\nspeci?ed in advance. This can be quite restrictive in practice,\nsince the number of clusters in a data set is generally\nunknown, especially in real-world applications.\nIn order to circumvent k-means limitations, the algorithm\nis usually combined with some sort of general purpose\nmeta-heuristic. Evolutionary algorithms are meta-heuristics\nwidely believed to be able to provide satisfactory suboptimal\nsolutions to NP-hard problems, such as clustering [3], at ac-\nceptable time. Probably for this reason, several evolutionary\napproaches for clustering problems have been proposed in\nthe literature [3], [4].\nThe present work is an improvement of the study pre-\nsented at [5]. It tackles the problem of generating a model for\ndistributed clustering, based on k-means, for scenarios where\nthe number of clusters of the distributed data is unknown.\nFor such, we propose the generation and selection of k-\nmeans clustering locally in each data site and, after that,\nthe combination of the obtained clusters into a single global\nsolution that represents the whole data set. The improvement\nof this work resides on the transmission between nodes,\nwhich is done with a single round of communication and\nprovides a low data transmission cost The variants of\nthe algorithms are compared from two perspectives: the\ntheoretical one, through asymptotic complexity analyses;\nand the experimental one, through a comparative evaluation\nof results obtained from a collection of experiments and\nstatistical tests.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows:\nin Section II, a brief description of the area covered by\nthis work is provided. Then, a collection of k-means based\nalgorithms to cluster distributed data are described in Section\nIII. This collection of algorithms is experimentally compared\nin Section IV. Finally, the conclusions are addressed in\nSection V.\nII. DISTRIBUTED CLUSTERING\nTwo different approaches can be used to adapt a \(central-\nized distributed data sets: the exact\n2013 Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems\n978-0-7695-5092-3/13 $26.00 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BRACIS.2013.20\n70\napproach or the approximate one [6]. The ?rst consists of\nan exact distributed version of the algorithm that produces\na ?nal model identical to a hypothetical model generated\nby the centralized \(original model that\napproximates \(but may not be identical to original usually with less data\ntransmission or computational savings.\nAn exact distributed version of the k-means 


algorithm was\nproposed in [7], which consists of multiple communication\nrounds and updates of centroids clusters’ means k-means, the multiple rounds of\ncommunication can signi?cantly reduce the performance of\nthe algorithm especially if k-means is executed multiple\ntimes in order to estimate the initial cluster prototypes or\nthe number of clusters in the data.\nApproximated algorithms can signi?cantly reduce the\nnumber of communication rounds and the amount of data\ntransmitted, as the algorithm is based on data representatives\nor approximations instead of the data itself [6]. The main\nidea consists of applying parts of the algorithm on different\nsubsets of the data set and, after that, combining the results\ninto a single solution. The method used to combine the\nresults depends on the type of data distribution.\nThe most typical scenario consists of different objects of\nthe data set distributed among data sites. In this scenario the\nobjects share the same feature space Markov chains and the\nMonte Carlo method are used in [8] to combine clustering\ninformation and obtain a ?nal clustering model of the data\nset. Another approach combines locally clustering solutions\n\(obtained in the data sites e.g. centroids   the authors proposed the Combinations of Dis-\ntributed Clustering \(CDC combine distributed information about the data set into\na ?nal clustering solution. The results indicate that the\nCDC variants successfully obtained quality partitions for\ndifferent data distribution scenarios. However CDC were\nstill dependent on multiple communication rounds, which\nin?uences the total transmission cost of the algorithms and,\nconsequentially, its performance.\nIII. CDC WITH A SINGLE COMMUNICATION ROUND\nThe main contribution of this work resides on new ver-\nsions of the CDC algorithms, adapted to reduce the data\ntransmission between sites to a single communication round.\nThe main advantage of this adaptation are the signi?cant\nreduction in the communication rounds and amount of\ndata transmitted, which are advantageous for scenarios with\nlimited communication bandwidth such as mobile robots or\nsensor networks.\nThe CDC architecture is composed by data nodes and\na master node, which is similar \(and easily portable the distributed processing of large\ndata sets like Hadoop [10] and Spark [11]. A data node is a\nfraction of the CDC algorithm responsible for all processing\nwhich involves direct access to a subset of the data Each\ndata node is responsible for one subset of the data and no\nsubset can be processed by more than one data node. In\ngeneral, each data site has, at least, one data node. Data\nnodes are capable of transmitting information to other data\nnodes or to the master node. Differently from the data nodes,\nthe master node does not have direct access to the data set\n\(or part of it and combines this information into a global clustering\nsolution.\nGenerally speaking, CDC have two main steps the ?rst is\nthe generation of clustering models and the second combines\nthe models obtained in the ?rst step These steps will be cov-\nered in Sections III-A and III-B. Differently from [5], CDC\nproposed here transmit the data in a single communication\nround, also detailed at Section III-B.\nA. Generation of clustering models\nThe ?rst step of the CDC algorithms is the generation\nof data partitions \(clustering models of the data\nnodes, i.e., the application of a clustering algorithm to the\nsubsets of the distributed data. A hard partition of a data set\n? = {x1,x2, ...,x?}, composed of ?-dimensional feature\nor attribute vectors x is a collection ? = {?1, ?2, ..., ??}\nof ? non-overlapping data subsets ?? \(clusters and ?? ? ?? = ? for\n? ?= ?. In this work, we use an improved variation of the\nEAC algorithm 12], [13] to generate these partitions. EAC is\ncapable of circumventing the k-means limitations presented\nin Section I, and estimating the number of clusters and the\ncorrespondent centroids by means of evolutionary operators.\nEAC partitions are represented by individuals that, in turn,\nare codi?ed by genotypes. The set of genotypes is called\npopulation, whose cardinality is given by ?? ?. Empirical\nevidence suggests that algorithms such as the EAC are robust\nfor distinct value choices for this parameter [14], [15], [16].\nValues such as ?? ? = 10 enable the algorithm to obtain\ngood partitions within a reasonable computational time This\nvalue will be adopted in the present work. The genotypes are\ninitialized by randomly drawing both the number of clusters\n called ?tness, a relative validation index [17] is used to\nassess the appropriateness of each obtained partition. When\nused for this purpose, the relative index is considered a\n?tness function the VRC index will be\nused as ?tness function for being one of the best indexes\nevaluated in [18], [17] and for allowing CDC to execute\nwith a single communication round \(see Section III-B for\ndetails strategy keeps the best solution \(Step 9  operator\n71\n\(e.g., proportional selection, such as the roulette selection\n[19] ? Step 10 iteration \(also known as generation criteria are used for k-means: convergence\nand a maximum number of iterations, ?. Convergence is\nattained when 


no signi?cant difference 1 is observed between\nthe values of the centroids in two consecutive iterations.\nAdditionally, ? is imposed to k-means. Empirical evidence\nsuggests that ? = 5 or less repetitions will ordinarily\nsuf?ce for algorithms such as EAC [20], [16], given that\nthe evolutionary search favors a cumulative re?nement of\nthe data partitions2. Therefore, this value is adopted in this\nstudy.\nThe EAC uses two mutation operators. The ?rst one elimi-\nnates one or more clusters, adding its objects into the clusters\nwith the closest centroids. The second splits one or more\nclusters into two new clusters each. An improvement from\nthe original EAC version [13], the proportion of application\nbetween the two operators is adjusted dynamically based on\nthe performance obtained by each operator in the previous\ngeneration. If the use of an operator generated a genotype\nwith ?tness higher than its predecessor, this operator will\nbe chosen to mutate the generated genotype afterwards.\nOtherwise, the other operator will be chosen. If the genotype\nbelongs to the initial population or was selected by elitism,\nboth operators have the same chance of being chosen This\nmethod was successfully applied in [22], [5] and will also\nbe adopted here.\nLast but not least, EAC requires a stopping criteria SC.\nSome possible stopping criteria SC for EAC \(applied in Step\n17 de?nition of a maximum number of generations,\na threshold for population diversity, and others [3 The\nstopping criteria adopted in the experiments presented in\nthis work are discussed in Section IV. Once stopped, the\nalgorithm returns the best evaluated partition g? and its\nnumber of clusters ??.\nA brief description of the EAC algorithm used in this work\nis presented in Algorithm 1, in which ? is the current gen-\neration, ?? is the current population, ?? ? is the population\nsize and SC is the stopping criterion.\nAfter the EAC stops, the centroids of the ?ttest \(best\nevaluated and the number of\nobjects in each cluster are transferred to the master node.\nB. Combinations of clustering models\nIn the CDC second step, the master node generates a\ncombined partition of the data set based on the centroids and\nthe number of objects in each cluster. Since the centroids\nshare the same feature space \(as the objects of the data\n1A threshold of 10?3 is adopted in this paper \(for normalized data 21] for a comprehensive experimental study related to\nthis issue.\nAlgorithm 1 Evolutionary Algorithm for Clustering \(EAC apply the ?-means algorithm to each genotype;\n6: evaluate each genotype according to the ?tness\nfunction;\n7 end for\n8: if SC is not satis?ed then\n9: apply elitist strategy;\n10: select genotypes from ??;\n11: for all selected genotypes do\n12: randomly select clusters to be mutated;\n13: apply the mutation operators in the selected\nclusters to create new genotypes;\n14: end for\n15: copy the new genotype to the next population 1\nand increments ?;\n16: end if\n17: until SC is satis?ed\n18: return ??;\nset these centroids with clustering\nalgorithms in order to obtain a meta-partition.\nLet ?? = {c1, c2, ..., c?} be the set of centroids from\nall data nodes, resulting from the the ?rst step of CDC\nalgorithms, where ? is the total number of centroids. A meta-\npartition is a collection ?? = {??1,??2, ...,????} of\nmeta-clusters ??? for which ??1???2? ...????? =\n?? , ??? ?= ? and ??? ???? = ? for ? ?= ?.\nIn order to obtain the global partition it is possible\nto compute the centroid of a meta-cluster \(mc a meta-centroid is\ncalculated as the mean of the centroids in the meta-cluster\nweighted by the number of objects these centroids represent.\nAdditionally, a meta-partition may be converted into the\nglobal partition of the original data set by replacing each\nclustered centroid by the objects it represents.\nThree clustering algorithms are used to combine the set of\ncentroids ??: the EAC \(Algorithm 1 single-link and complete-link [1]. As the hier-\narchical clustering is a nested sequence of hard partitional\nclusterings, each level of the hierarchy is evaluated with the\nVRC index \(the same used as the tness function for EAC partition VRC index is exact, i.e., it obtains\nthe same result as the centralized version of the index for\nthe global partition, given by3:\n3When VRC is applied to meta-partitions, the variables ?, ????, and c?\nare replaced by and mc?, respectively.\n72\n  1 1 between-cluster sum of squared dis-\ntances \(Equation \(2 Equation \(3 n??\n?=1\n????\(c? ? x c? ? x 2 and the centroid of the the ?th cluster,\nwhich are the variables ???? and c?, respectively.

These\nvalues are constants for the data set and are summed for\neach data subset in the ?rst step of the CDC. The sums\nare transferred to the master node along 


with the results\nobtained in the ?rst step, allowing the CDC algorithms to\ncalculate the exact VRC value with a single communication\nround. The variables c2?? and ???? are the squared value\nof the ?th attribute of the th centroid and the i?? cluster\nsize, respectively. When computed for the meta-partition,\nthe master node does not require direct information about\nthe data subsets, thus no extra rounds of communication are\nneeded.\nC. Complexity of the CDC algorithms\nAssuming that the ?-th data node has ?[?] objects, the rst\nstep of the CDC algorithms has a computational complexity\nequivalent to that of EAC summed over the multiple data\nnodes, i.e., ?\(???? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ˆ??? ? \(?[1]+?[2   the limit of k-means iterations,\nˆ\n??? is the maximum number of clusters codi?ed by a\ngenotype during the evolutionary search, ? is the number\nof data nodes, ? is the number of objects in the whole\n\(distributed set and ?[?] is the number of objects in\nthe ?th data node. If executed in parallel, this complexity is\nreduced to Moreover,\nif ???? ? ?/?, then the complexity of the CDC ?rst step\nis second step of\nthe CDC algorithms has the computational complexity of\nthe clustering algorithm adopted. For this estimation, the\nnumber of clustered objects is the total number of centroids\nthat resulted from the ?rst step 2 ? log If EAC is adopted, the computational cost of\nthe second step is allocation cost in the ?rst step is ?\(ˆ??? ?\n  if\nthe EAC algorithm is adopted. Otherwise, if the hierarchical\nalgorithms are used, the dissimilarities between centroids\nlead to a memory allocation cost of ?\(?2 among\nthe data nodes and the master node between Steps 1 and 2 is\nestimated as major reduction\nin relation to the original CDC versions proposed in [5].\nAdditionally, it is important to note that the transmission\ncost does not depend on the number of objects in the data\nset, which makes the algorithm scalable for this aspect.\nIV. EXPERIMENTS\nExperiments with a collection of data sets were carried\nout to evaluate the CDC algorithms. The quality of the\nresulted partitions is measured by the Jaccard external index\n[23] in relation to the known clusters or “golden truth”.\nThe execution time and amount of data transmitted were\nmeasured using the Matlab software in computers with quad\ncore 3.0 Ghz processors and 12 GB of RAM memory.\nThese calculations consider that each data node executes\nexclusively in a single computer and that the data are\ntransmitted concurrently. It is important to note that the\nexperiments presented in this section aim at comparing\neach of those aspects independently, as the execution and\ntransmission time are machine dependent.\nA collection of 80 arti?cial data sets created by an\nellipsoidal cluster generator in [24 was chosen for the\nexperiments presented here. Each data set of the collection\nwas distributed among data nodes in two ways: balanced and\nunbalanced. The balanced distribution consists of distribut-\ning the data set among data partitions while maintaining\nthe same proportion of objects each known cluster has in\nrelation to the original data set. When this proportion is not\nmaintained, the distribution is considered unbalanced For\na detailed description of the methods for data distribution\nadopted here, please refer to [25].\nIn the experiments presented in this study, two stopping\ncriteria SC will be adopted for the EAC \(Step 17 of Algo-\nrithm 1 reference value ??.\nTo compute ??, a process executes k-means 100 times4 and\nthe best validation value is stored. This process is repeated\n30 times and the ?? value is calculated as the mean of the\n30 best validation values stored. The ?? can not be assumed\n4The ? value used is the known number of clusters.\n73\nas the only stopping criterion for the CDC because it is\nnot possible to ensure that these algorithms are capable\nof resulting in partitions with ?tness values equal to or\nhigher than ??. For this reason, a limit of 100 generations\nis adopted as an additional stopping criterion for the EAC\nroutine used as part of the CDC algorithms.\nFour variants of the CDC algorithms were compared:\n1 2nd step.\n2 CDC.\n4 10g dur-\ning the combination of clusters \(CDC second step generations\nwithout improvement on the ?tness value of the best\npartition of the population.\nEach of the four CDC variants was applied to the balanced\nand unbalanced distributed data sets. Results from CDC\nvariants applied to unbalanced data set will be distinguished\nfrom other results with the symbol \(U pre-\nsented in Section IV-A.\nA. Results\nIn order to assess the signi?cance of the experimental\nresults hypothesis tests were adopted. The ANalysis Of\nVAriance \(ANOVA  are drawn from populations with normal distribu-\ntions and similar variances [27]. As these requirements 


are\nnot ensured here, we applied the \(non-parametric  hypothesis\nwas rejected, indicating that there is statistical evidence to\nsupport that the compared results are different, the Bon-\nferroni procedure [29] was applied to the critical values to\ncompensate for the multiple comparisons and maintain the\nactual level of statistical con?dence in 95%.\nAll compared algorithms were executed 30 times for each\ndata set and the mean values over these executions are\npresented in Tables I II and III for data distributions in 5, 20,\nand 80 data nodes, respectively. The best mean values and\nthe values without statistically signi?cant difference from\nthe best ones are highlighted in bold.\nThe results in Table I indicate that the variants of the\nCDC algorithms that adopt hierarchical clustering algorithms\nat the second main step presented the best results when the\ndata sets were distributed among 5 data nodes CDC-VRC-al\nis the variant with the best Jaccard mean values followed by\nthe CDC-VRC-sl. When computational time is considered,\nthe results between these variants are inverted. Unbalanced\ndistributed data resulted in a lower data transmission, which\nwas caused by the absence of a few clusters in the data\nnodes.\nComparing Tables I and II, the quality of the CDC\nvariants was slightly reduced when the number of data nodes\nCDC Variant Jaccard Time \(s KB 0,2444 2,75 3,68 U 0,6135 \(0,2414 2,08 3,18 0,2502 2,75 3,68 U 0,2474 2,10 3,18 0,2852 8,38 3,68 CDC-VRC-EAC \(U 0,2944 7,97 3,18 10g 0,2793 3,35 3,68 10g U 0,2915 2,96 3,18 VALUES OBTAINED BY THE\nCOMPARED ALGORITHMS WHEN APPLIED TO THE COLLECTION OF DATA\nSETS DISTRIBUTED AMONG 5 DATA NODES.\nCDC Variant Jaccard Time \(s KB 0,2349 1,68 12,99 U 0,2706 1,01 9,89 0,2369 10,16 56,71 \(12,99 U 0,2747 8,97 9,89 0,2821 11,93 12,99 U 0,2838 11,63 9,89 10g 0,2781 4,10 12,99 10g U 0,2841 3,88 9,89 II\nMEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION VALUES OBTAINED BY THE\nCOMPARED ALGORITHMS WHEN APPLIED TO THE COLLECTION OF DATA\nSETS DISTRIBUTED AMONG 20 DATA NODES.\nincreased. This reduction may have resulted from the overlap\nbetween clusters, evidenced by the increasing number of\ncentroids in the CDC ?rst step \(please refer to [25] for a\nmore detailed explanation the CDC-VRC-sl was\nthe fastest. Also, the unbalanced distributed data resulted in\nlower data transmission.\nCDC Variant Jaccard Time \(s KB 0,2323 2,38 48,30 CDC-VRC-sl \(U 0,2370 2,43 39,77 0,1948 116,19 48,30 U 0,1917 116,20 39,77 0,2880 11,07 48,30 U 0,2871 10,61 39,77 10g 0,5190 \(0,2844 3,76 48,30 10g U 0,2843 3,76 39,77 COLLECTION OF DATA\nSETS DISTRIBUTED AMONG 80 DATA NODES.\nWhen the data set was distributed into 80 data nodes the\n?rst step of the CDC algorithms produced a large number of\ncentroids. Differently from the distribution into 20 nodes, not\nonly the overlap between clusters was evidenced, but also\ntheir density and distribution Although another reduction\nin the quality of the CDC-VRC-sl variant was observed,\nthe CDC-VRC-al provided the best quality partitions of\nall experiments presented in this study. Once more, the\nCDC-VRC-sl was the fastest variant, and the unbalanced\ndistribution resulted in lower data transmission.\n74\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe experiments in [5] were executed with the same\nprocedures and data sets described in Section IV. The\nadoption of the VRC index signi?cantly reduced the amount\nof data transmitted between CDC nodes. However, in gen-\neral, the quality of the partitions was inferior, compared to\nthose obtained in [5]. The best partitions presented in this\nwork resulted from the CDC-VRC-al, with computational\ntime close to the fastest variant \(the CDC-VRC-sl Thus,\nCDC-VRC-al is recommended for scenarios with limited or\nexpensive transfer rates.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors acknowledge the Brazilian agencies CNPq,\nFAPEMIG and FAPESP for the ?nancial support.\nREFERENCES\n[1 R.

The AutoGopher Drill above the 3 m deep \nhole \(note the yellow tape The 32 rock cores are placed \ninside the 4 protective tubes. \nDrilling Telemetry \nDuring the course of the drill test, we acquired drilling \ntelemetry such as power, penetration rate and Weight on Bit \nto estimate the resources required from a spacecraft during \nplanetary missions. In addition, we varied percussive \nduration and duty cycles to optimize drilling efficiency.  \nWe found that the average penetration rate for the 3 m hole nwas 1 m per hour \(or 3 hours for a 3 m hole hole, \nempty the catch basket of drilled cuttings, retrieve the core, \nand lower the drill back into the hole For a 3 m hole, these \noperations totaled approximately 10 hours. In addition, we \nexperienced approximately 4 hours of downtime due to \nbroken wire that had to be repaired and issues related to \nmisalignment between the anchor above the hole and the \nborehole itself. The latter one is of particular importance \nsince it will have to be addressed via re-design or \noperational sequencing. We found that having a half of the \nanchor pads are above the hole and the bottom half are in \nthe hole induces abnormally high WOB values. This is a \nresult of small misalignment between the hole and the \ndeployment system. Ideally, the anchors would have to be \nfully above the hole or in the hole – in either of the cases, \nthe WOB was nominal.  \nFigure 17 shows the rate of penetration \(ROP percussion is used and increase with an \nincrease in the duty cycle, reaching maximum at 100% duty \ncycle i.e. percussion always on nresults in high penetration rate. If the on/off periods are \nincreased to 5 seconds, the penetration rate drops by 50% \nthough. This implies that during the ‘off’ periods, \npenetration rate is very low.  \nWe also found that with the percussion system on, the WOB \nand rotary power would decrease. In some instances, the nrotary actuator would stall whenever percussive system was \nturned off.  \n \nFigure 17.

The least efficient approach is rotary drilling with nno percussion.  \n \nFigure 18. Drilling Energy per meter of depth as a \nfunction of Percussive Power and duty cycle. \n6. CONCLUSIONS  \nOne of the most pressing questions in space science that we \nare currently faced with is whether life has ever arisen \nanywhere else in the universe. Since water is a critical \nprerequisite for all Earth-based life as we know it, the \nnearest-known exploration targets for extraterrestrial life are nMars, Europa, and Enceladus. Due to the oxidizing nature of \nMars’ surface, as well as high radiation levels at the surfaces \nof Mars, Europa and Enceladus, the search for existing life \nmust likely focus on subsurface locations, at depths \nsufficient to allow liquid water. \nThe main feature of the developed Auto-Gopher is its nwireline operation. The drill is suspended on a tether and the \nmotors and mechanisms are built into a tube that ends with a \ncoring bit. The tether provides the mechanical connection to \na rover/lander on a surface as well as power and data \ncommunication. Upon penetrating to a target depth, the drill \nis retracted from the borehole, the core is deposited into a \nsample transfer system, and the drill is lowered back into the \nhole nThis wireline system allows core acquisition from depths \nlimited only by the length of a deployment tether Wireline \noperation sidesteps one of the major drawbacks of \ntraditional continuous drill string systems by obviating the \nneed for multiple drill sections, which add significantly to \nthe mass and the complexity of the system.  \nThe Auto-gopher has been successfully tested in a \nlaboratory environment in 25 MPa Texas crème limestone \nrock to a depth of 2 m. The average drilling power was in \nthe range of 100-150 Watt, while penetration rate was \napproximately 2.5 m/hr. The energy required to penetrate 1 \nm depth in Texas crème limestone was measured to be 60 \nWhr. \nThe Auto-gopher has also been successfully tested in a field nenvironment in 40 MPa Gypsum in the US Gypsum Quarry \noutside Borrego Springs, CA to a depth of 3 m. The average \ndrilling power was in the range of 100-350 Watt \(depending \non the duty cycle of the percussive system no percussion percussion at 100% duty 


cycle percussion at 100% duty cycle to 450 Whr/m \(no \npercussion depth. The most energy \nefficient drilling was found when the percussive mechanism \nwas activated continuously. It required approximately 200 \nWhr to drill 1-meter. The rotary drilling with no percussion \nwas found to be the least efficient approach. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nResearch reported in this manuscript was conducted at \nHoneybee Robotics and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \n\(JPL under a contract \nwith National Aeronautics Space Administration \(NASA for Exploring Planets \n\(ASTEP staff at the US Gypsum for assisting in the \nAutoGopher field deployment at the US Gypsum quarry in \nBorrego Springs, CA.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
