INTRODUCTION Network Intrusion Detection System is commonly classified into host-based intrusion detection system \(HIDS I] and network intrusion detection system \(NIDS  course, there are some intrusion detection systems which are a combination of both, generally referred to as hybrid intrusion detection System \(HIDS individual host while NIDS protects the whole network And both of them have their advantages and disadvantages In this paper, fuzzy association rules are introduced to design a real-time network intrusion detection system Different from [3], it takes a long time to collect packets of information before making off-line analysis. However, [3 has its disadvantages. On one hand, the system does not meet the needs of real-time detection and real-time processing, which are required in an invasion system. On the other hand, short-term attack is likely to be diluted during a long-period flow of packet information and cannot be detected since it is unable to meet the minimum support In addition, because different types of attacks usually require specific detection methods to achieve excellent results, the text also differs from [3] in the selection of signature and the application of fuzzy function. In this paper denial-of-service attack serves as an experimental subject II. Dos AND DDOS The so-called DoS\(Denial of Service 


attack that utilizes limited network resources \(such as Memory, Processor and Bandwidth, etc loopholes in the design and application of partial network system software, or other related communication protocol to make the attacked websites unable to process requests through substantial and intensive packet transmission. In this way, many users who try to get normal access to those websites will be rejected; or the attempt to identifY loopholes the program has failed to handle will crash the system so that it will be out of service. DDoS \(Distributed Denial of Service of service attacks but there are more triggered attackers III. THE ALGORITHM OF Fuzzy ASSOCIATION RULES We will give an introduction of how to compute the similar degree among association rules, fuzzy association rules and rules, which are basic knowledge related to this paper. Then, specific examples will be given to explain how to apply the knowledge to the design of network intrusion detection system A. The Algorithm of Association Rules Association rules [4] are defined as follows: suppose 1= {ip i2, i3 ,jm } is the set of all items, database D the set of all transaction record T and T a subset of any item from I. A set X S;;; I is called itemset, the number of items which contained is regarded as the length of it. If its length is k, then it is claimed as k-itemset. If a transaction record supports an itemset X, it must contain all items of X, X S;;; T written as support\(X The representation form of association rules is X => Y,X Y S;;; I and X n y =0. Association rules depend on two parameters \(support and confidence are meaningful or not. Support refers to the percentage of X U Y transaction records in database, written as support \(X U Y association rules, that is, the chances that Y will appear when condition X occurs, written as support \(X U Y X For valid association rules, their degree of support and confidence must be equal to or higher than the threshold level set by the user, which is also the minimum support and confidence. In general, the widely used algorithm in association rules is Apriroi algorithm [4]. Apriori algorithm for mining association rules is divided into two parts 


Phase I: search database and find out frequent itemset or large item set Phase2: use frequent itemset or large itemset to extract all association rules, whose confidence is lower than the minimum B. The Algorithm of Fuzzy Association Rules Support \(X and is calculated according to its record counts in database D When used in intrusion detection, each item will appear in every record, and have a quantization value. Their difference between them can be learned from record description by checking database D. Suppose I = \(A, B, C, D, E 978-1-4244-7164-5/$26.00  2010 IEEE VI-129 Volume 1 2010 International Conforence On Computer Design And Appliations \(ICCDA 2010 are five records in database D.\(a in traditional Data Mining and \(b Intrusion Detection. The first record in \(b statistical network traffic in certain unit time. And there are 25 packets with signature A, 53 with signature B, 9 with signature C, 21 with signature D and 12 with signature E The network information flow in next unit time will be described by the second record, and so on. Unit time can be determined by network traffic but we must take into account the processing time to ensure the instantaneity. However, the traditional Apriori algorithm doesn't apply to quantitative database. In the field of data detection, many solutions on the problem of item quantification have been proposed. In this paper, fuzzy Logic is adopted to mine such quantitative database and the association rules mined is called Fuzzy Association Rules For quantitative data, one of the most straightforward ways is to grade value for each item clearly. In item A, we set value below 20 is Low, value between 21 ? 60 Medium value above 61 High; In item B, we set value below 100 Low value between 101 ? 300 Medium, value above 301 High and so is with C, D, E. The database in \(b table! is described as follows A=Medium, B=Low, C=x, D=x, E=x A=Low, B=Low, C=x, D=x, E=x A=Low, B=High, C=x, D=x, E=x A=High, B=Low, C=x, D=x, E=x A=Medium, B=Medium, C=x, D=x, E=x

In \(a for example, the occurrence counts of A = Medium can only be calculated by accumulating records in the database, such as A = 21, A = 22, ... , A = 60. Although there are a great deal of such records as A = 18, 19 or 61, 62, they contribute little to the counts of A = Medium. Obviously, it is possible that the association rules mined though this method will fail to describe the real situation. Let' suppose the interval of A Medium extends to 19 on the left or 61 on the right, then the association rules mined may be completely different To solve Sharp Boundary Problem, the concept of Fuzzy Logic is introduced in [6]. In accordance with Fuzzy Logic each item is renamed Fuzzy Variable and each category Fuzzy Sets, such as Low, Medium and High. The difference lies in the fact that Fuzzy Sets \(Low, Medium and High no longer clearly graded, but individually described by a continuous function, which is called Membership Function such as \(b A, B C, D, E usually must be accompanied by y being part of weighted values\(grade b there is one record A = 20, B = ... , which belongs to A Low \(0.5 0.95 0 in parentheses is 20 and that is the weighted value when respectively incorporated into Membership Function \(A Low, A. Medium and A. High  


Certainty are introduced to replace the degree of support and confidence in traditional Apriori algorithm record Low Medium a b High A Figure I. Adopting the Difference between Discrete Split and Fuzzy Logic Here we regard <F,S> as an itemset, where F is the sequence of signature\(or item Fuzzy Set, J; the ith signature and FS,O the corresponding M b h F . . h '  \(1 < i < I I h I h em ers Ip unctIOn III t e Itemset - - , IS t e engt of item set then F = \(A, B, C Low, High, Low A, B, C and FS, 0, FS2 ,FS, o represents A.

The calculation of Certainty can be defined like this: suppose <F, S> is the large-item that produces Fuzzy Association Rules, and it is the presupposed itemset of such rules\( conditional narration Association Rules can be defined as follows Sig\(FS F.s F.S F S I L n FSi\(vlaue cl item Ii record e D i=l k L n FS j \(vlalle cl item Ij record e D j=l \(2 I is the length of <F, S> and k is the length of <F I S I >. The Certainty of each rule can be calculated by Sig\(FS Sig\(FS kept and the rest removed 


C. Computation of Similar Degree Let's first introduce the computation of similar degree between two fuzzy association rules and later between two sets of fuzzy association rules. Suppose rl and r2 are two fuzzy association rules, sl and c1 represent Significance and Certainty of rI, and s2 and c2 represent Significance and Certainty of r2. Then the similar degree between s rI and r2 is calculated as I? 1??? sim\(rl r2 o, I-max\(---, ..r.:.....:::L f r 1 "r2 II13X{c I, e2 s? s2 3 The so-called r 1 =r2 indicates that it is the same between antecedent and consequent of two conditional narrations. In other words, different rules can't be compared and their similar degree is zero; only similar degree of the same rules can be computed by the above formula As to two sets of fuzzy association rules, suppose their similar degree are sO and sl respectively, the computation for will be like S '1 . "\(SO SI Score Score Iml arlt>'. , =--x-I SOl I SII Score = Lsim\(rO,rl Where ???:f ISil represents the number of rules, i=O,1 \(4 IV. SYSTEM FLOW Although [3] are based on fuzzy association rules to study intrusion detection, they do not apply this method to real-time detection system. In other words, it takes them a long time to collect packet information before making omine analysis of whether such packet flow is abnormal or not However, it is unable to make instantaneous response though this method. What's worse, if the attack time is very short the number with attacking signature will fail to reach minimum support and be ignored in such long-time packet flow. In addition, it doesn't mention in [3] how signature is produced. Through carrying out 150 automatically collected Dos attacks, checking possible signatures and sorting them according to the value of Information Gain, signatures in this paper refer to the first twelve ones with high Gain value under the premise of considering a system with instantaneous ability. Last, based on identifYing the source address and fixing communication port, this system can dynamically alter the filtering rules of the firewall \(Linux' s 


iptable Since this system regards fuzzy association rules detected by packet flow information as its basis for judgment and packet flow may affect setup of certain parameters, it is suggested that the simulating tests and the actual tests should be in the same position of the whole network topology to receive better detection results. When doing simulating tests we collect packets in a specific position of network topology for three hours and make sure if there are DoSIDDoS attacks before simulating set of fuzzy association rules for comparison. The concrete steps are as follows: gathering packet traffic statistics once per unit time\(2 seconds calculating twelve required signature values and forming the fi d f 5400 . I '  r 0 :!> i :!> 5399    h Irst recor 0 III tota , wrItten as ' \( I IS t e serial number of record Then we try to average the total sum of records with the same remainder when 3 is divided by the serial number and the three averaged records will better display the state of network traffic in a certain period. Last, the three records is used to figure out a set of fuzzy association rules for matching. Particularly,network traffic condition differs greatly in different period. In order to get better detection results and reduce false positive rate, fuzzy association rules for individual matching is required in the experiments aiming at different periods, such as morning, noon, afternoon evening and night In practical tests, a record is also formed by twelve signature values of packet traffic statistics gathered once per unit time \(2 seconds worked out by three accumulated records, we compute the similar degree between it and the rules produced in experimental periods. If the similar degree is lower than threshold, it is decided that there are attacks. Once attacks occur, this system cannot automatically update the firewall to block connection unless source of such attacks have been traced Network attacks vary a lot. A complete intrusion detection system is usually constituted by a number of detection modules, each of which is responsible for detecting certain type of attacks. On the other hand, given to considerations of instantaneity, more than one detection module will be more convenient for parallel processing. Any 


intelligent judgment depends upon the selection of signature but different signatures are required to effectively detect different types of attacks. This system mainly aims at DoSIDDoS. Based on Information Gain values, the selected 12 signatures are arrayed in descending order as follows O. number of different payload length 1. number of different source IP address 2. number of different destination IP address 3. number of different TCP source port 4. number of different TCP destination port 5. number of different UDP source port VI-Bl Volume 1 2010 International Conference On Computer Design And Appliations \(ICCDA 2010 6. number of different UDP destination port 7. number of TCP protocol 8. number of UDP protocol 9. number of ICMP protocol 10. number of SYN flags II. number of ACK flags omiscuo --+ __ --.I us Mode capture feature statistics rvfining Fuzzy Association Rules Normal network behavior No Abnormal  behavior Cal culate the value of grades Figure 2. System Flow chart Each signature has three Fuzzy Sets: Low, Medium and High Membership Function in use is taken from Default Function of MATLAB Fuzzy Tool Box \(as follows and c can be adjusted into constants. Figure. 3 is the instance of Membership Function. Constants of a and c in Low are 0.3 and 30; constants of a, b and c in Medium IS, 2, 50 constants of a and c in High -0.3 and 80 Low: f \( x I+exp\( a \( x - c Medium: f \(  x I + 1 \( x  - c 


High: f \( x I+exp\( -a \( x - c In experiments, we adjust the coefficient so that the signature attains more significance by making Information Gain value higher and Overlay Memory wider. However since not all signature statistics applies to the same Fuzzy Membership Function, many testing experiments are required to fine-tune each Membership Function to appropriate values and grade of individual Membership Function must be calculated in each signature. There are 12 signatures in one record and each signature have to calculate its grades in three different Membership Function. In other words, every record has 36 items, such as ill.low, ill.medium ill.high, . . .  , fll.low,fll.medium, fll.high,so it may mine numerous rules in 3 records gmde   Figure 3 Feature value Low, Medium, and High in Membership Function V. THE ANAL YSIS O F  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The setup of system parameters differs as its operating environment changes, because we need to take into account in experiments which period is more accurate. Namely, the morning detection rules is best used for network intrusion detection merely in the morning as sometimes great changes takes place in network traffic condition in different periods of a day. This experiment is based on two buildings of students' dormitory and performed in the night. Of the ISO collected DoS attacking software, 100 is used in experiments to search the above-mentioned 12 signatures \(higher Information Gain In order to test the detection results of this system, we have selected three types of attacking \(i.e. SYN Flood, Ping of Death and Smurf set 2seconds as an unit time and perform mining \(a judgment once every three unit time, so a unit in the horizontal axis of Figure.5 and Figure. 4 represents 6 seconds. During the experiment, Fuzzy Association Rules is produced by a long period accumulating of packets, averaging three records and incorporating them into algorithms of fuzzy association rules 


Through long-time collecting and averaging, normal conditions can be better reflected, but it have to take us more time to identitY whether these packets contain DoS attacks The bar graph value in Figure. 4 indicates the similar degree between fuzzy association rules and detection rules of real-time packet information. If the similar degree is lower than 0.1\(10 a the experimental results when the school uses DoS Smurf\(lGMPNUKE VI_O points, we perform normal network behavior, but at the later stage of the third time point, we start attacking procedures and keep attacking, from which it is found that the rules detected during following time points carry low similar degree with fuzzy association rules.

way from 10%, the threshold. Finally, we execute the 50 attacking procedures thoroughly and their similar degrees are shown in Figure. 6. In Figure. 6, each value is the average of ten times, once each day, ten days in total. With every similar degree lower than 10%, it suggests that the twelve signatures selected by sorting Information Gain values and the selecting mode of coefficients in Membership Function can immediately detect DoslDDoS attacks in the design of our real-time network intrusion detection system Last, we emphasize that measurement of similar degree is greatly affected by network traffic. If network packet information changes frequently, then the measured value will fluctuate in a larger section. Besides, the similar degree is also influenced by density or duration of the attacking 1 _-------0.9 0.8 EfiI'IIlO.'0.' ________ _ 0.5 --------0.4 ------lto.3 ------0.2 --------o 3 4 5 6 "'" 14 'wum?unnnMD?u.g Figure 5.

THE CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH This paper mainly contributes to the design of a real-time network intrusion detection system based on Fuzzy Association Rules. Though we take only three units of time to detect information traffic, there are 36 actual items in each record and three records can detect out many rules since 12 signatures are adopted in each record and each signature value can be incorporated into three fuzzy Membership Functions. By comparing similar degree with experimental rules, if they are lower than 0.1\(10 them as attacking events. According to experimental results it is found that our system can make correct judgment and won't cause false positives towards massive FTP packets in a moment after appropriate adjustment of system parameters In the following few days, our work should focus on 


improving the efficiency of detecting procedures, including cutting unit time from the present two seconds to one second redefining the calculating mode of similar degree; adjusting the coefficients of fuzzy function by Genetic Algorithm attempting to detect based on Incremental transaction database instead of three transaction records. In the detection of incremental transaction database, we expect only one more accurate detection is performed in each unit time because both the present and the past information of the record will be detected REFERENCES I] German Florez, Susan M.Bridges , and Rayford B.
