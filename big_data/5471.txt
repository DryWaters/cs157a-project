Visualizing e-Government Portal and Its Performance in WEBVS Ho Si Meng, Simon Fong Department of Computer and Information Science University of Macau, Macau SAR ccfong@umac.mo Abstract An e-Government portal is responsible to provide news, information and services to citizens, merchan ts and tourists in a reliable way Previously we proposed a Web Monitoring System WMS that monitors the performance of a web portal in realtime [1   W e b  p o r t a l  s t r u c t u r e  i s  c o m p l e x  t o  a n a l y z e though it is important to discover useful patterns  evaluate performance, locate anomalies and identify  problems Visualization is helpful in performance evaluation and interpretation of web usage mining results. In this paper we proposed a tool comprised  of visualization and fuzzy association rule mining  called Web Visualization System WEBVS as an extension to the WMS for monitoring and analyzing performances of e-Government websites 1. Introduction In the past decades the rapid growth of ICT has driven governments to digitalize documents, provide  information and implement online services in many countries On the other hand such use of ICT has increased pressure on governments to improve performance and achieve a better government According to 2   a s  g o v e r n m e n t s  a r e  d e v e l o p i n g  more and more electronic services they are also coming to the realization that they often do not kn ow what kind of e-government citizens want ICT tools have provided governments with new ways to provide information and to consult with citizens, b ut determining the preferences of citizens and businesses with regard to the structure and content of electronic services rests a true challenge Many people would hard-pressed to be able to articulate their expectations of government even with a full understanding of the technological possibilities The target users of an e-Government portal are usually in three groups citizens merchants and tourists Their needs and preferences can be very different Taking care of them effectively and reliably is the main objective of an e-Government portal It is necessary to ensure the information a nd online services are delivered accurately effective ly and efficiently to these three groups of users hen ce meeting their expectations and preferences In 1   we proposed a WMS to constantly monitor the e Government portal in real-time. The results of WMS however come only in the forms of statistics and performance reports. In this paper, we propose to u se WEBVS to visualize the results of WMS by showing the discovered patterns and performance statistics and superimpose them over the website structure in a social network. Presentation of such information wi th colors and thickness of nodes and edges is easier t o understand interpret and locate anomalies or interesting phenomenon than lists of statistics and  numbers report. We believe such a visualization too l will assist the site administrators and analysts in  decision making maintenance and analysis In addition to the visual graphs WEBVS also outputs association rules of the web access data obtained from web logs The association rules reveal the relations between pages services visited and the visitor’s browsing behavior. In Section 2, we discu ss related web visualization works Section 3 tells th at how our WEBVS relates to the WMS. Our WEBVS web visualization is discussed in Section 4 showing  the result graphs and describing the features and functions Section 5 comes the generation and technique of the Fuzzy Apriori Association Rules we  use in WEBVS Finally we draw a conclusion in Section 6 2. Related Work In the past decade researchers have been exploring visualization methods for understanding the activities that happen over websites 6   R e c e nt researches focus on the interactive visualization o f the web usage data. However, we have not found any interactive tool or application developed specially for visualizing and analyzing web access and usage in a n e-Government portal 978-1-4244-7571-1/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE 315

The framework enabl es flexible selection of mappings between data attributes and visualization dimensions for differe nt diagrams. In the case of large scale portal like an eGovernment however 3D diagrams will be too dense to interpret In 4   t h e  W e b  K n o w l e d g e  V i s u a l i z a t i o n  a n d  Discovery System \(WEBKVDS\ is mainly composed of two parts a FootPath for visualizing the web structure with the different data and pattern layer s; b Web Graph Algebra: for manipulating and operating on the web graph objects for visual data mining. Th e authors presented the idea of layering data and patterns in distinct layers on top of a disktree representation of the web structure allowing the display of information in context which is more suited for the interpretation of discovered pattern s And with the help of the web graph algebra the system provides a means for interactive visual web mining WebViz system a tool to visualize both the structure and usage of web sites is proposed in 5    The structure of a web segment is rendered as a radial tree, and usage data is extracted and layere d as polygonal graphs By interactively creating and adjusting these layers a user can develop real tim e insight into the data The system shows the idea of interactive visual operators and the idea of a poly gon graph as a visual cue The polygonal graphs however are not straight forward enough and it needs time to interpret to discover useful information 3. Proposed Solution The analytic results from the four modules in WMS together with the web structure are imported to the WEBVS for visualization The web structure is rendered as a radial tree and the analytic results will be overlaid on it by some visual cues Web administrations and analysts can select different d ata attributes and thresholds to visualize The web graphs rendered by the WEBVS give the idea of how an e-Gov portal is doing Such presentation of the portal status is easier to understand and locate anomalies or interesting phenomenon than just lists of numbers in a report Together with the performance reports generated by the WMS, the site administrations and analysts should be able to know the operating status and performance of the portal at a glance An overview of WEBVS in relation to WMS is shown in Figure 1 Figure 1. Web-based Visualization System In figure 2 performance data and web pages information are input to the Integration Engine 3 for data preparation i.e extracting cleaning transforming, integrating data and finally loading into database and later generating XGML for interactive 2D visualization There are two graph views with analytic results mapping on a web structure radial tree in WEBVS: static graph view visualizes the web page information which only have changes after updates e.g the HTML file size content type number of words and links in a page etc dynamic graph view visualizes the web performance statistic s which is generated by the WMS and changes from time to time e.g page views active time bounce rate number of clicks and visitors etc WEBVS enables the web administrations and analysts to vie w both graphs together and select their preferred vis ual cues for finding interesting patterns The Fuzzy Se ts Generator normalizes the active times on a page for each page view and creates the fuzzy sets for findi ng association rules 4. Visualizing e-Government Portal Definitions of e-government vary in its  The use of information technology to free movement of information to overcome the physical bounds of traditional paper and physical based systems” [7  The use of technology to enhance the access to and delivery of government services to benefit citizens, business partners and employees.” [8  The common theme behind these definitions is that e-government involves the automation or computerization of existing paper-based procedures that will prompt new styles of leadership new ways of debating and deciding strategies new ways of transacting business new ways of listening to citizens and communities and new ways of organizing and delivering information [9   316 


Figure 2. A possible implementation architecture of WEBVS 4.1. Input Data and Assumptions In addition to the analytic results from the WMS web structure should be prepared and imported into WEBVS for visualization Figure 3 shows the input data for the static graph visualization in XGML Moreover to discover the preferences and needs of the citizens merchants and visitors we have to identify what are their hot pages and what these ho t pages are about Hot pages in 3  a r e  t h o s e  p a g e s  with many hits The number of hits received by a website is frequently cited to assert its popularit y, but this number is extremely misleading Therefore our WEBVS measures the hot and cold pages by active time which is the average amount of time that visitors spend on each page of the site The web pages are classified into several content groups according to their keywords for examples news information, media, e-services, etc. Then we measur e their popularities as hot or cold pages Figure 3. Input data for static view in XGML format Visualizing such access data our WEBVS can help the web administrations easily identify what conten t a merchant needs and what content should be translated into a language 4.2. Web Graphs In figure 4 WEBVS visualizes the web information in Static view and performance data in Dynamic view For both static and dynamic views there is an expandable control panel providing options to configure the mapping between data attributes and visual cues The static graph view provides the page information in complement to the dynamic web access graph for web administrations and analysts to figure out the anomalies occurring in the web portal in a more efficient way The web structure is visualized as radial tree [10  In the radial tree layout a single node is placed a t the center of the display and all the other nodes are l aid around it. The entire graph is like a tree rooted a t the central node The central node is referred to as th e focus node and all the other nodes are arranged on concentric rings around it. Each node lies on the r ing corresponding to its shortest network distance from the focus. Any pair of nodes joined by an edge in t he graph is referred to as neighbors Immediate neighbors of the focus lie on the smallest inner ri ng their neighbors lie on the second smallest ring, an d so on Radial tree layout is suitable for dynamically changing graphs since the addition or deletion of a node perturbs its siblings only by a small amount especially as the graph becomes dense In WEBVS the focus node can be switched around by simply clicking at one of the other nodes In figure 5, nodes are colored by content type, i.e  green nodes represent pages with media content and red nodes are downloads, while larger nodes indicat e 317 


that the pages have larger file size meaning the pa ge contains more content This graph when compared with the dynamic graph with node size representing active time in dynamic view can clearly show if visitors spend more time on a web page with more content If not the page is having low performance and the web administrator must find out the reason and take action to improve maybe by adding a link in a related hot page Figure 6 is a visualization of web structure as a radial tree showing what the hot pages are in the dynamic graph view The green nodes are those pages with active time above the threshold set by t he site administrator They are the hot pages on which users spend most time in browsing and interacting actively with the content The thickness of the edg e shows the usage traffic. Site administrator or anal yst can select usage data of users from one country or one user group to visualize. The analytic results f rom the web log analysis module on WMS contribute to this function Actually with the results from WMS WEBVS can visualize various web graphs of particular interest A site administrator can interactively find out where broken links exist if any where page load time is higher than an acceptable range, and other phenomena of interest There are various indicators of a website that can be shown in the static and dynamic views in our WEBVS with different visual cues It will have a more readable, meaningful and interesting web graph when quantitative indicator relating to size repres ents with node size and categorical or unevenly distributed indicator represents with node color Table 1 shows a typical mapping we found in WEBVS Figure 4. The user interface of WEBVS showing both Static and Dynamic views Figure 5. Details are shown when mouseover a node Figure 6. Green nodes are the popular pages interested by users from Portugal 318

Fuzzy Apriori Association Rules Association rule discovery techniques are generally applied to databases of transactions wher e each transaction consists of a set of items. The go al is to discover all associations and correlations among data items where the presence of one set of items i n a transaction implies with a certain degree of confidence the presence of other items In the context of Web usage mining it is used to discover the correlations among references to various pages available on the server by a given client Each transaction is comprised of a set of URLs accessed by a visitor 12   C o n v e n t i o n a l  A s s o c i a t i o n  R u l e  Mining \(ARM\ algorithms usually deal with datasets with categorical values and expect any numerical values to be converted to categorical one s using ranges In real life data is neither only categorical nor only numerical but a combination of both And the general method adopted is to convert numerical attributes into categorical attributes us ing ranges The problem with the above approach to dividing ranged values into sub-ranges is that the boundaries between the sub-ranges are crisp boundaries. Fuzzy Association Rule Mining \(FARM is intended to address the crisp boundary problem encountered in traditional ARM The principal idea is that ranged values can belong to more than one sub-ranges is that the boundaries between the subranges are crisp boundaries. Fuzzy Association Rule Mining FARM is intended to address the crisp boundary problem encountered in traditional ARM The principal idea is that ranged values can belong to more than one sub-ranges , we say that the value ha s a membership degree   that associates it with each available sub-ranges For example we define three age categories Young Middle-aged and Old and then ascertain the fuzzy membership \(range [0, 1   of each crisp numerical value in these categories. Thu s Age  35 may have    0.6 for the fuzzy partition Middle-aged    0.3 for Young and    0.1 for Old.[11  T h u s   b y  u s i n g  f u z z y  p a r t i t i o n s   w e  p r e s e r ve the information encapsulated in the numerical attribute and are also able to convert it to a categorical attribute albeit a fuzzy one Therefor e many fuzzy sets can be defined on the domain of each quantitative attribute, and the original datas et is transformed into an extended one with attribute values having fuzzy memberships in the interval 0 1   To measure the success or popularity of a page, as we discuss earlier, we use the active time instead of number of hits When a visitor browses through the internet he/she will stay longer in pages that hav e updated useful and attractive content In web log files, we can find out the web usage data of a visi tor telling us where he/she locates what pages viewed and the active time spent on a page We have no problem in defining the locations of the visitors i nto categories of countries or regions However to discover what content they are interested in from a set of pages we can only measure the length of the active time. In this case we define the categories  as content groups of the pages which are the same as w e have defined earlier for the static view web graph i.e News, Information, Download, Media and e-Service Then normalize the active time on a page into the interval 0 1  b y  d e c i m a l  s c a l i n g  n o r m a l i z a t i o n  t o generate the membership degree of the categorical attribute As in classical association rules I  i 1 i 2 i m  represents all the attributes appearing in the transaction database T  i 1 i 2 i n  I contains all the possible items of a database different combinations of those items are called itemsets. Ea ch attribute i k will associate with several fuzzy sets In order to represent the fuzzy sets associated with i k  we use the notion  where is the j th fuzzy set Therefore, we have the attribute Page as follows F Page   News Information Download Media eService } and obtain a fuzzy database as in Table 2  319 


Table 2. Sample fuzzy database After setting the support and confident perform Fuzzy Apriori algorithm and get interesting rules a s shown in Figure 7 We can see that visitors who spent longer time on pages with the content of medi a and download are from Macau Figure 7. Association rules generated by applying FARM 6. Conclusion The information and online services of an eGovernment portal should be delivered accurately effectively and efficiently to different groups of users to meet their expectations and preferences. Knowing the needs and preferences of users is very importan t For this purpose WEBVS is proposed to visualize the analytic and performance results of WMS together with web page information in web graphs and generate interesting and meaningful association rules. Such web graphs and association rules help t he web administrator to discover and locate where anomalies or interesting phenomenon are and, hence take actions to improve the portal when necessary for providing a successful e-Government portal 7.

We have not test for those variables   The projects that we analyzed were stable and had a few number of transactions per day \(Table 1\ Less stable or more dynamic projects may yield different results   Like in t h e  or der i ng o f  cha nge s m a y i n fl ue nc e  the results for Navigation and Error Prevention VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  This article shows that software module modification association rules derived from our stable industrial environment were more effective than those derived from the OSS projects reported in the literature. As association rules are already being successfully applied for impact analysis in this context [5  o u r  resu l t s i n d i c a tes th at th ey c a n  als o  b e  effectively applied in industrial environments such as the one we studied  We believe that this finding may stimulate further studies in the industry and, hopefully, motivate them to invest on association mining to support software maintenance and evolution activities  It is important to observe that in our analysis systems with little evolutive maintenance, such as the Marketing and the Customer Management System, yield rules with precision and recall better than the average. This was expected as more stable systems should yield better association rules Also, independent of the number of transaction per day systems with small training sets, such as the Accounting and the Web Services Systems, yield rules with precision and recall worse than the average. This was also expected, as this number training examples helps to strengthen the rules As mentioned before, we adapted the software engineering experimental process described in Wohlin et al  o so ft w a r e  r e po si t o r i e s m i ni ng e x p e r i m e nt s. We be l i e v e that the studies, applications, and tools for software repository mining can benefit from this type of approach Rigorous experimental description facilitates replication of studies and the executing of systematic reviews and other types of secondary analysis in the field [18  C o n s id e r in g th e  number of studies being done in the area, we believe that experimental formalism combined with approaches like standardization of data exchange formats among software repositories [1  can  con t ri b u t e t o f a cili tat e th e ex ecu t i o n  and replication of studies in the area As future work, we will start to look at fine granularity associations, analyzing classes and methods as opposed to files. We will also analyze relationships between coupling and the associations mined from version control systems We are currently finishing a Microsoft Visual Studio plug-in to use the mined rules to aid programmers on the fly It will work as a monitor that verifies saved files and warns programmers about unverified associated files. This will facilitate the programmers’ impact analysis effort and mitigate errors during program modification. After its completion, the plug-in will be experimentally evaluated in carefully controlled case studies. Lastly, we will use our Data Warehouse [6 o t e st s e ve ra l  o t her so ft w a r e m i ni ng  techniques over the data we have already gathered and preprocessed A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This study could only be developed due to the full support of CIAL–Brazil and its staff.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
