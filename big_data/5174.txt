An NML-based Model Selection Criterion for General Relational Data Modeling Yoshiki Sakai Kenji Yamanishi Graduate School of Information Science and Technology The University of Tokyo Tokyo Japan Email  yoshiki  sakai yamanishi  mist.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp Abstract Whereas the main interest in most existing data mining approaches has been sequence data on a single type of object namely attribute data real-world databases store information about multiple relationships between various classes of objects The modeling of these general relational data GRD plays an important role in eliciting knowledge across multiple relations It is not reasonable to directly apply existing modeling methods to GRD because GRD have statistical properties that distinguish them from attribute data In this paper we address the issue of statistical model selection in GRD modeling From the viewpoint of the minimum description length principle we propose a new model selection criterion by considering the statistical properties of GRD We employ the normalized maximum likelihood code-length as a model selection criterion and provide an asymptotic expansion theorem for its application to GRD modeling To demonstrate its use in a critical application we apply our proposed criterion to the issue of model selection in relational data clustering An experiment using artiìcial datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our technique compared to other criteria and we also present a brand analysis using real beer-purchase data Keywords relational data model selection normalized maximum likelihood code-length stochastic block model I I NTRODUCTION We are concerned with the modeling of general relational data In the elds of statistics machine learning and data mining interest is typically focused on sequence data for a single type of object known as attribute data However real-world databases store information about multiple relationships between various classes of objects Let us consider the example of a purchase records database Fig 1 We are interested in two classes of objects customers and items The database may not only store the proìles of customers or attributes of items but also data about the purchase relationship between customers and items This may sometimes include information regarding friendships among customers Data that consist of multiple tables on multiple classes of objects are called general relational data GRD A certain customer proìle may be strongly correlated with certain attributes of the items they buy Customers or items could be divided into a number of clusters to help us understand the purchase behavior of the global customer base The mining of GRD aims to reveal such hidden patterns eliciting knowledge across multiple tables             012 012   015 012 012     015	\012         012   015                                                        Figure 1 Example of general relational data Statistical modeling plays an important role in GRD mining The central issue in GRD modeling is the selection of an appropriate statistical model Statistical model selection determines the optimal probabilistic model for representing the given data from a set of candidate models Simple models with few degrees of freedom may fail to capture the nature of the data whereas complex models with many degrees of freedom may overìt the data losing their structural signiìcance To justify the statistical meaning of the selected probabilistic model it is important to balance this trade-off The problem of model selection arises frequently in several practical data mining tasks such as structure learning in Bayesian networks e.g determination of the number of clusters in clustering e.g and rank determination in matrix factorization e.g The purpose of this paper is to propose a new model selection method that considers the statistical properties of GRD models and to empirically demonstrate its advantages over other possible criteria In attribute data modeling many criteria for model selection have been established Akaike proposed Akaik e s information criterion AIC which is founded on information entropy later Schwarz stated the Bayesian information criterion BIC on the basis of Bayesian statistics Following these a number of other criteria have been proposed Some criteria such as BIC have been common ways to deal with the model selection of relational data e.g Ho we v e r  2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 421 


few model selection criteria suitable for GRD modeling have been studied Most existing criteria have been derived under the condition that the central limit theorem CLT holds uniformly over the attribute data Such criteria cannot be directly applied to GRD models because GRD are a mixture of attribute and relational data of various sizes meaning that the CLT does not hold uniformly over them It is therefore important to develop criteria that account for the variously sized data and asymptotic properties of GRD In this paper we consider model selection on the basis of the minimum description length MDL principle which offers a general model selection framework from an information-theoretical approach The underlying idea of the MDL is that learning can be equated with data compression MDL theory asserts that the best model is that which minimizes the total code-length required to encode the given data and the model itself In applying MDL-based model selection the normalized maximum likelihood NML code-length which is also known as the stochastic complexity  can be the most effective criterion NML is justiìed in the sense that it achieves Shtarkovês minimax criterion and it has been reported that NML-based model selection is effective in a wide range of learning issues such as clustering 11 denoising and Bayesian netw ork structure learning 2  The dra wback of NML is that its na  ve computation is generally hard requiring a number of summations over the whole domain of all variables This can increase the computational complexity of GRD modeling explosively In terms of attribute data modeling Rissanen pro vided an asymptotic expansion theorem for NML and this enables us to calculate the approximate NML However Rissanenês theorem does not apply to GRD modeling and its asymptotic expression is not appropriate for GRD models Thus we propose a new theorem based on that of Rissanen to approximate NML for GRD models The signiìcance of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 A new NML-based criterion suitable for GRD modeling We propose a new criterion suitable for GRD modeling on the basis of NML As GRD are a mixture of various-sized attribute and relational datasets we cannot apply ordinary one-way asymptotic evaluation In this paper we deal with the various sizes of GRD and derive an asymptotic form of NML for GRD models This enables NML-based model selection in GRD modeling 2 Application to relational data clustering As a critical application we address the task of determining the number of clusters in relational data clustering We apply our proposed criterion to the selection of the stochastic block model SBM and deri v e a n e w ef cient method for calculating the NML code-length for SBM to determine the optimal number of clusters Using artiìcial datasets we experimentally demonstrate that our criterion is more effective than other possible criteria In addition we demonstrate the validity of our model selection method through its applications to real beer-purchase data The rest of this paper is organized as follows We rst introduce GRD in Section II and explain MDL-based model selection with the NML code-length in Section III In Section IV we present a new theorem for NML of GRD models We describe an application to relational data clustering in Section V and show experimental results in Section VI We nally give our conclusions in Section VII II G ENERAL R ELATIONAL D ATA M ODELING In this section we formulate and describe the modeling and statistical model selection of GRD We also present some examples of GRD model selection tasks Suppose we have S types of object classes  such as customers or items and let the s th class contain N s objects Let N  N 1 N S  denote an object size vector We deìne attribute data as a sequence of vectors attached to each object We denote the attribute data of the s th object class as x N s s  x s 1  x sN s X N s s  s  1 S    We also consider relational data  which consist of information about the relationship between objects Relational data can be expressed by a network matrix or tensor We denote relational data among the s th and t th objects as a matrix x N s  N t st   x st,ij X N s  N t st  s t  1 S    Let us now consider a mixture of B attribute or relational datasets D  x N 1 x N B   where x N b  b  1 B   denotes attribute or relational data We refer to the data D as general relational data  Note that we distinguish general relational data from relational data We now formulate the statistical modeling of GRD and model selection We consider variables in the given data D to be instantiations of random variables  D  X N 1 X N B   Statistical modeling aims to grasp the characteristics of the joint distribution of variables  D through a probabilistic model P   P   D    In this paper we are especially interested in a parametric class of probability distributions P   P   D          where  is a parameter space and P   D    denotes a probability distribution of  D speciìed by a parameter     Suppose that we are also given a nite countable set of candidate models M  A model M M is an indicator of the corresponding probabilistic model P M   P   D        M   where  M is a parameter space speciìed by the indicator M  Statistical model selection then aims to choose the optimal model  M from M to represent the joint distribution of D  As mentioned in Section I model selection in GRD modeling concerns several practical tasks In Bayesian network structure learning we seek to determine the optimal factorization structure of the joint distribution of data D  Suppose we have the following classes of probabilistic 422 


models P  X N 1 X N B  B  i 1 P  X N i  Pa i   1 where Pa i  X N 1 X N B  denotes a set of parent variables of X N i  Bayesian network structure learning aims to compose the optimal sets of parent variables  Pa i   Friedman et al proposed Probabilistic Relational Models PRMs which can be thought of as an extension of Bayesian networks for relational database mining The structural search of PRMs is also a challenging model selection task Relational data clustering is the task of partitioning objects into clusters according to observable relational data which may include network clustering and co-clustering Suppose that we are given unipartite network data about a single type of N objects denoted by x N  N  Let the latent attribute variables Z N  1 K  N indicate the cluster to which each object belongs We can see that relational data clustering is a kind of GRD modeling as we model observable relational variables X N  N and unobservable attribute variables Z N simultaneously i.e  D  X N  N Z N  In relational data clustering model selection determines the optimal number of clusters K  We consider an example of SBM in Section V The task of rank determination in matrix factorization is similar to that of cluster number determination in relational data clustering except that the domain spaces of latent variables are continuous rather than discrete One crucial characteristic of GRD is the variety of data sizes The size of attribute data increases linearly with respect to the number of objects N s  the size of relational data is polynomial with respect to the number of objects i.e O  N 2 s   O  N 3 t  or O  N s N t   Thus statistics derived from GRD models also have various convergence or divergence properties The sample distributions of MLEs in GRD models converge to normal distributions at different rates with respect to the object size vector N  Therefore we have to develop criteria that account for the variety of data sizes and asymptotic properties of GRD If the probabilistic model can be factorized as 1 we could also consider applying existing information criteria to each factor P  X N i  Pa i  individually and summing them In this paper we rather consider the NML code-length to develop a criterion that is independent of such a factorization We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed criterion is more effective than the methods described above III N ORMALIZED M AXIMUM L IKELIHOOD C ODE LENGTH In this paper we consider model selection based on the MDL principle This section introduces its mathematical formulation and describes the NML code-length A MDL Principle and NML Code-length The MDL principle asserts that the best model is that which minimizes the total code-length required for encoding the given data L  D  M  as well as the model itself L  M   M  argmin M M  L  D  M  L  M    In this paper we assume that the code-length of L  M  can be uniformly calculated as ln M  With regard to the codelength of the given data L  D  M   the normalized maximum likelihood NML code-length is employed The NML codelength is deìned as follows L NML  D  M  def   ln P  D     D   ln   D P   D      D   2    D  is the maximum likelihood estimate of  from D  The NML code-length is justiìed in the sense that it achieves Shtarkovês minimax regret  Let us consider all possible preìx code-length assignments over the domain of D  When a model M is given it is reasonable to employ the code-length assignment that minimizes the following max regret criterion max  D  L   D  M   min    M  ln P   D       3 Shtarkov showed that the NML code-length 2 minimizes the max regret 3 According to the MDL principle we select the model that minimizes the NML code-length 2 as the best model B An Asymptotic Property of NML NML-based model selection suffers from two computational problems First when the domain space of the input variables  D or the parameter space  M is unbounded the second term of NML 2 may diverge to inìnity Rissanen and Hirai and Y amanishi 11 addressed this problem by restricting the domain range of the given data Second computation of the second term in 2 is generally expensive This is because we must sum over the whole domain of all variables As the number of random variables increases this combinatorial computation increases explosively This problem is especially remarkable in GRD modeling because we consider multiple attributes and relational variables In this paper we are concerned with the latter computational complexity problem provided the former divergence problem can be avoided One approach to the reformulation of this problem is to use an approximation of 2 In terms of attribute data modeling Rissanen pro vided the follo wing asymptotic expansion theorem for NML Assume the attribute data x N are given and that a probabilistic model P M   P  X N        M   where the parameter space  M is compact satisìes the following ve conditions 423

tionship between beer brands and customers Our proposed criterion played an important role in determining the number of clusters in this analysis We nally compare our proposed criterion with other ones For example AIC discovered four customer clusters and the customer behavior suggested by each cluster is rather different from that given by NML ICL selected only ve brand clusters whereas results of NML also distinguished brand clusters B and E Each of these results shows certain aspects of the data but we emphasize that the model selection results given by NML are justiìed from the perspective of data compression VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have addressed the issue of statistical model selection in GRD modeling From the viewpoint of the MDL principle we have clariìed the asymptotic property of NML in GRD modeling and have proposed a new model selection criterion We have applied our proposed criterion to the issue of model selection in SBM learning and have derived a new and efìcient method of calculating the NML code-length for SBM The effectiveness of our NML-based criterion has been demonstrated experimentally using artiìcial data and real beer-purchase data Thus for the rst time we have realized a model selection technique that considers the statistical characteristics of GRD models We will extend our discussion to other problems and criteria A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partially supported by MEXT KAKENHI 23240019 by the Aihara Project the FIRST program from JSPS initiated by CSTP by HAKUHODO Inc and by MACROMILL Inc R EFERENCES  B Long Z Zhang and P  S Y u  Relational Data Clustering Models Algorithms and Applications  Chapman  Hall/CRC 2010  T  Roos T  Silander  P  K ontkanen and P  Myllymaki Bayesian network structure learning using factorized NML universal models in Information Theory and Applications Workshop  Feb 2008 pp 272 276  P  K ontkanen P  Myllym  aki W Buntine J Rissanen and H Tirri An MDL framework for data clustering in Advances in Minimum Description Length Theory and Applications  MIT Press 2005  A T  Cemgil Bayesian inference for nonne gati v e matrix factorisation models Intell Neuroscience  vol 2009 pp 4:1Ö4:17 Jan 2009  H Akaik e  A ne w look at the statistical model identiìcation  IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control  vol 19 no 6 pp 716  723 Dec 1974  G E Schw arz Estimating the dimension of a model  Annals of Statistics  vol 6 pp 461Ö464 1978  E M Airoldi D M Blei S E Fienber g and E P  Xing Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels J Mach Learn Res  vol 9 pp 1981Ö2014 Jun 2008  J Rissanen Modeling by shortest data description  Automatica  vol 14 no 5 pp 465  471 1978   Fisher information and stochastic comple xity   IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 42 no 1 pp 40 47 Jan 1996  Y  M Shtark o v  Uni v ersal sequential coding of single messages Problems of Information Transmission  vol 23 no 3 pp 3Ö17 1987  S Hirai and K Y amanishi Ef cient computation of normalized maximum likelihood coding for Gaussian mixtures with its applications to optimal clustering in Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ISIT  Aug 2011 pp 1031 1035  J Rissanen MDL denoising  IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 46 no 7 pp 2537 2543 Nov 2000  Y  Hayashi and K Y amanishi Sequential netw ork change detection with its applications to ad impact relation analysis in IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ICDM2012  2012 pp 280Ö289  T  A Snijders and K No wicki Estimation and prediction for stochastic blockmodels for graphs with latent block structure Journal of Classiìcation  vol 14 pp 75Ö100 1997  N Friedman L Getoor  D  K oller  and A Pfef fer  Learning probabilistic relational models in Proceedings of the 16th international joint conference on Artiìcial intelligence  vol 2 1999 pp 1300Ö1307  J.-J Daudin F  Picard and S Robin A mixture model for random graphs Statistics and Computing  vol 18 no 2 pp 173Ö183 2008  C K emp J B T enenbaum T  L Grif ths T  Y amada and N Ueda Learning systems of concepts with an inìnite relational model in Proceedings of the 21st national conference on Artiìcial intelligence  2006 pp 381Ö388  C S W allace and P  R Freeman Estimation and inference by compact coding Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B Methodological  vol 49 no 3 pp pp 240Ö265 1987  C Biernacki G Celeux and G Go v aert  Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence IEEE Transactions on  vol 22 no 7 pp 719Ö725 2000  H Jef fre ys  A n i n v ariant form for the prior probability in estimation problems in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series A Mathematical and Physical Sciences  vol 186 no 1007 1946 pp 453Ö461  I S Dhillon S Mallela and D S Modha Informationtheoretic co-clustering in Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  2003 pp 89Ö98 429

and emotional topic, it is not a top priority for US foreign policy  This paper has multiple limitations on its research. The datasets included are only for the three most recent female Secretar ies of State and cannot be used to generalize an overall US foreign policy message. Also, there is a gap between the three female Secretaries filled by Secretary of State Colin Powell. For purposes of this paper, and in order to keep gender consistent across all datasets, Secretary Powell was not included Another limitation is the lack of keyword in context analysis. Although these keywords and phrases are important due to their number of times used, as well as their appearance in a large percentage of cases, their context may differ. Further analysis of these important keywords and phrases will lead to deeper insights and more complex nuances  This study is an initial analysis on three separate datasets. Further contextual analysis can lead to deeper understandings of the frequently occurring keywords and phrases that are predominant from each Secretary. Keyword in context analysis will provide further unpacking a nd clearer definitions of what each keyword or phrase means when the Secretary uses it. A prior crosstabs analysis on the Secretary Clinton dataset provided further clues to the evolution of keywords and phrases over time and geography. This analysis will be completed on Secretary Rice and Secretary Albrightês datasets as well. Future analysis will include Secretary Powellês tenure from 2001-2005 in order to see if his themes are consistent with those before and after his term Future research will also include the final two approaches from the ASSANA Methodology traditional hand coding as well as the High Performance Computing Environment. Incorporating these other approaches will allow for a full review of the differences in findings and time for analysis between each approach
