This Program, known as FORMOSAT-\n7/COSMIC-2, is the follow-on to the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC \nmission, which was a joint US-Taiwan 6-satellite constellation \ndemonstration mission launched in April 2006.  The COSMIC nmission was the world’s first operational GPS radio \noccultation \(GPS-RO forecast; \nclimate monitoring; atmospheric, ionospheric, and geodetic \nresearch.  The GPS-RO data from COSMIC has been \nextremely valuable to the climate, meteorology, and space \nweather communities, including real-time forecasting users as \nwell as U.S. and international research communities.   \n \nFORMOSAT-3/COSMIC reached the end of its design life in \n2011. The constellation satellites have exhibited some un-\nrecoverable anomalies and consequently the critical real-time \nsatellite observing capability is degrading and may go offline \nwith uncertainty in the coming few years. \n \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n\(NOAA Taiwan’s National Space Organization \(NSPO ndegrading COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 constellation and agreed \nto implement the follow-on COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 \nmission in 2010.   Both experienced programmatic difficulties \nin the past two years in the course of implementing the nCOSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 Program; however, significant \nprogress over the past six months has occurred.   \nThis paper will provide an overview of the COSMIC-\n2/FORMOSAT-7 Program including the Program goals and nobjectives.

BACKGROUND \nCOSMIC/FORMOSAT-3, hereafter referred to as \nCOSMIC, is a joint U.S.-Taiwan 6-microsatellite \ndemonstration mission that was launched in April 2006 and \nis being operated by Taiwan’s National Space Organization \n\(NSPO Positioning System Radio Occultation \n\(GPS-RO transmitters on GPS satellites and GPS receivers \non low Earth orbiting \(LEO nopposite sides of the planetary limb.  Orbital motion of both \nsatellites produces the limb scanning geometry.  The \ntechnique provides a unique combination of high precision \nand vertical resolution at long wavelengths that penetrate \nthrough the atmosphere in nearly all conditions. Figure 1 \n  2 \nillustrates a COSMIC satellite in LEO intercepting the GPS \nsignal in order to perform GPS-RO. \n \nFigure 1. COSMIC Satellite Intercepting GPS Signals [1] \nAlthough COSMIC was originally intended as an \nexperimental demonstration mission, it has become the \nworld’s first operational GPS-RO mission for global \nweather forecasting and climate monitoring. The data have \nalso been valuable for atmospheric, ionospheric, and \ngeodetic research The National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration \(NOAA the mission from two locations in the U.S. and \none in Norway since April 2008.  The satellite system is 


ncurrently operating and providing global data in near-real-\ntime to over 1,000 users worldwide, including NOAA’s \nNational Weather Service.   \nThe COSMIC mission reached the end of its design life in \n2011, and the critical real-time satellite observing capability \nhas begun to degrade due to un-recoverable anomalies or nsatellite mortality \(one out of six satellites Oceans \nand Atmosphere stated in his FY10–FY14 Program \nDecision Memorandum that the NOAA was to develop a nfollow-on plan for the COSMIC.  In parallel, in June 2011, \nNational Science Council \(NSC submitted \nFORMOSAT-7 Program Execution Plan.  As a result, \nNOAA and NSPO intend to provide data continuity and \nimprove sensing capability with the next-generation, \nCOSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7, hereafter referred to as nCOSMIC-2. \n2. PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES \nThe primary objectives of COSMIC-2 are to increase the \nnumber of RO measurements and to transition into a global, \nreliable, system supporting both atmospheric research and noperational weather prediction.  This new constellation will \ncontinuously and more uniformly collect tropospheric and \nionospheric data as inputs to daily near-real-time weather \nforecasts, climate studies, and space weather research.     \nCOSMIC-2 will meet its objectives by intercepting signals \nfrom not only the U.S GPS, but also the European \nnavigation satellite system GALILEO, and the Russian \nGlobal Navigation Satellite System \(GLONASS navigation satellite signals than just \nthose from the GPS. \n3. SATELLITE AND CONSTELLATION \nCONFIGURATION nCOSMIC-2 is expected to be a much improved operational \nsystem consisting of a new constellation of 12 satellites. The \nmission payload will be a TriG GNSS-RO receiver and will \ncollect more data points per receiver by adding the \ncapability to track the GALILEO and GLONASS systems, \nwhich will produce a significantly higher spatial and \ntemporal density of profiles over tracking GPS signals \nalone.  In addition to the mission payload, the COSMIC-2 \nspacecraft will host science instruments on all 12 satellites.   \nThe constellation is planned to be comprised of 6 satellites \nat 72 degree inclination, and 6 satellites at 24 degree \ninclination, which will enhance observations in the \nequatorial region over what is currently being collected with \nCOSMIC.   \nWhen fully deployed, this constellation will produce more \nthan 8,000 soundings per day, compared to the approximate \n2,000 soundings per day currently produced by COSMIC.  \nFigure 2 illustrates the comparison of sounding distribution \nover a three hour period between COSMIC and COSMIC-2. \n  \nFigure 2 COSMIC vs. COSMIC-2 Sounding Comparison \n[1] \n  3 \nThe first COSMIC-2 launch, into a 24 degree inclination norbit, is planned for early 2016, and Initial Operational \nCapability \(IOC Final \nOperational Capability \(FOC degree inclination \norbit.  Both launches will place 6 satellites into a parking \norbit and then each satellite will be moved to its operational \norbit over a total deployment period of about 15 months for \n6 satellites. COSMIC-2 has a design life of 5 years from \nFOC.

The \nTriG Engineering Model was delivered and re-work for \ndesign changes are in process The first sensor delivery is \nscheduled for December 2013. [8] \nThe current plan for the RF Beacon is to utilize two designs \ndeveloped by two vendors. There is currently a draft \nCommon Interface Control Document ICD developer. The USAF has received initial \nNTIA feedback for Stage 1 frequency certification. [8] \nThe VIDI is comprised of two parts: the IVM and the SPLP.  \nAn Ion Velocity Meter \(IVM nSeptember 2012, and was attended by five potential bidders.  \nUTD is on contract for the design qualification, and \ndelivery of the first flight unit, with scheduled delivery of \nSeptember 2013.

CONCLUSIONS  \nCOSMIC has been on the forefront of radio occultation in \nconstellation measurements for atmosphere and ionosphere \nand has been regarded as the “Most Accurate and Stable \nThermometer in Space” by the global meteorology \ncommunity Especially, it provides at least 60% of the \n  5 \nassimilated observations for worldwide Numerical Weather nPrediction centers for the last 6+ years.  Although the \nCOSMIC constellation is now beyond its initial design life, \nNSPO is still providing significant resources to allow the \nextraction and provision of occultation measurements in \nNear-Real-Time to continuously serve the global users.   \nIn viewing the need of the constellational global RO data to \ncontinue the enhancement of the weather predictions and the \nclimate 


observations, the COSMIC-2 Program will be \nimplemented to reduce the potential RO data gap and \ncontinue to serve the global meteorology community.  \nSignificant efforts from U.S. and Taiwan sides have \ncontributed to the joint mission, and the first launch of \nCOSMIC-2 in late 2015 / early 2016 can be expected.   \n nREFERENCES  \n[1] Courtesy of UCAR \(University Corporation for \nAtmospheric Research, Boulder, CO  COSMIC-2 Spacecraft Bus System Requirements \nDocument \n \n[3] COSMIC-2 Joint Mission Requirements Document  \n n[4] C.-J.

successive range [ls, r s] delimits a\ntight boundary of the sub-index-model table over the rele-\nvant SSs that are suitable for processing with MapReduce.\nThis hybrid paradigm eliminates the Map-phase processing\nof SSs of irrelevant nodes between So and D and the nodes\nbetween the elements of So. Moreover, it is non-intrusive for\nboth the key-value store and MapReduce. Regarding the time\n\(or value node set So without\nD, hence, only range-scan-based model filtering and gridding\nis needed.\nSuppose that the number of reducers is P and each reducer\nis denoted by 0"" ,P-l. For range queries, the partition\nfunction f is used to assign the qualified modeled segments\ninto different reducers. It is designed on the basis of query\ntime \(resp. value  resp. [lv, rvD and the time \(or\nvalue  modeled segment i. The idea is\nthat each of the reducers is in charge of one even sub-range\nrtpl t. Such a partition function f is given in Eq. 1.\n{\nl < r. < r l\(ri-ld*PJf\(ri functionalities of mappers and reducers are depicted in\ndetail below.\n• Mapper: Each mapper gets the time resp. value  resp. value function f\(ri Reducer: One reducer receives a list of qualified modeled\nsegments < pb"" ,Po >, < pi,... ,p? >, .... For each\nmodeled segment < P; ,... ,pr .>, the reducer invokes a\nmodel-based gridding function to compute discrete values\nas query results.\nRegarding the scan-based model filtering and gridding, as\nSSs in So are located in different regions of the index-model\ntable, the query processor makes use of thread pool to process\neach SS of So in parallel.

The SS of nodel5, enclosed by the bottom\ndot-dashed block, is processed via range scan.\nC. Theoretical analysis\nOne point to carefully consider is that is earch+ may\ngenerate redundant nodes, because the isearch+ aims to find\na tight and consecutive range of SSs for MapReduce. For\ninstance, in Fig. 4\(a MapReduce.\nTheorem 1: For a range query [It, r.l- the redundant nodes\nin [ls, rs] returned by i Search" are bounded.\nProof' Assume the height of the registration node T as\nh. Consider the left-descending path from T to the node lo\nclosest to It. Let d be the depth from which the descending\npath turns right, namely the value w It of the current node.\nThen, based on the isearch+ algorithm, w is the left boundary\nof accessed node range and w = T - 2::1=1 2h - i .\nFor a certain value of d, the worst case happens when the\ndescending process continues to go right until reaching la,\nas the nodes between wand lo are all redundant ones. The\nnumber of nodes returned by isearch+ under this case is\ngiven by: d .\nU=T-\(T-L2 h-1 2 ware all included into the output\nrange D of i.Search.v . The number of nodes returned by the\nconventional iSearch is given bYd h\nV=h-d+{T-\(T- L2h - i+ L 2h - i 3 nodes returned by\ni.Search" is given by: h\nf = U - V =d + L 2h - i - h\ni=d+1\n=d + 2h - d - h - 1\nThe Eq. 4 is a function of d and is monotonous decreasing in\nd's domain [1, h]. Consequently, when d = 1, the function f\nreaches the maximum value, namely, the number of redundant\nnodes from i.Search." attains the maximum value Therefore,\nfmax = 2h - 1 - h . \(5 is 2h - 1, hence\n1 1f < 2TJ - log\(TJ + 1 6 the\nrange [ls, rs] is bounded. •\nThe worst case happens when the endpoints It and rtare\nthe preceeding and succeeding nodes of T, namely It = T - 1\nand rt = T + 1. However, for most of the cases, the redundant\nnodes returned from i.Search" are very limited.\nVI. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nFirst, we compare model-view sensor data query processing\nwith conventional one over raw sensor data. Then, we show\nthat our KVI-Scan-MapReduce \(KSM approach outperforms\nother model-view sensor data querying approaches. Finally, we\nexperimentally explore the factors that affect the performance\nof KVI-Scan-MapReduce.\nA. Setup\nWe employ accelerometer data from mobile phones as\nsensor data set. The size of raw sensor data is 22 GB in-\ncluding 200 millions data points. After modeling, the modeled\nsegments of the sensor data take 12 GB, while there are around\n25 millions modeled segments.\nWe developed our system using the versions of Hbase\nand Hadoop in Cloudera CDH4.3.0. The experiments are\nperformed on our own cluster that consists of 1 master node\nand 8 slaves. The master node has 64GB RAM 3TB disk\nspace \(4 x 1TB disks in RAID5 Intel Xeon E5-2630 slave node has 6 cores\n2.30 GHz \(Intel Xeon E5-2630 3 x 2TB disks connected via 1GB Ethernet.\nIn the experiment results, we refer to query selectivity as the\nratio of the number of qualified modeled segments over that\nof total modeled segments.\nRegarding the online sensor data model-based segmentation,\nwe applied the PCA\(piecewise constant approximation  approximation \(PCA

Regarding gridding,\nwe choose 1 second as the time granularity for discretization\nof a modeled segment. The gridding granularity is a parameter\ndepending on end-user requirements.\nB. Model-view sensor data vs. raw sensor data\nRaw sensor data is a set of discrete data points each of which\nhas associated timestamp and value. We create two tables,\nwhich respectively take the timestamp and sensor value as\nthe row-keys, such that the query range or point can be used\nas keys to locate the qualified data points. Then, the query\nprocessor invokes the MapReduce to access the large size of\ndata points for query results.\nFig. 5 \(a b c and point queries respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 5 \(a b than the raw sensor data method for\nboth time and value range queries. Although the raw sensor\ndata based methods apply MapReduce to directly access the\nqualified tuples via the row-key based range scan, the amount\nof raw sensor data to process is much larger than that of the\nmodel-view approach. In Fig. 5\(c processing time of the\nraw data based method is 2 x less than that of the model-view\none in time point queries, because the raw data method can\nuse the query time point as index key to directly access the\nrelevant data points, while our KSM requires to perform model\nfiltering and gridding. For value point queries, the model-view\napproach has nearly 3 x less time than the raw data method.\nAs normally there is a large size of data points with the query\nvalue, MapReduce is used to access this qualified sensor data\nset. In model-view approach, the point query processing only\nuses random access and range scan to get qualified modeled\nsegments for gridding locally, and thus it saves the time on\nstarting MapReduce to access data.\nC. Comparison of model-view approaches\nThere are four baseline approaches for querying model-view\nsensor data namely:\nMapReduce \(MR the whole\nindex-model table to filter the qualified modeled segments in\nthe mapping phase and perform the model gridding in the\nreduce phase.\nInterval tree \(IT operations of the interval tree [6], [9] by adding\nanother table to store the SS of each node sorted by the right\nend-point of intervals. Each index, time or value, has two\nassociated tables. During the intersection or point search on vs-\ntree, the query processor decides which table to access based\non the relation between the query range \(or point encountering one unqualified modeled segment, due to\nthe monotonicity of end-points of modeled segments. IT makes\nuse of random access and range scan to sequentially filter the\nqualified modeled segments and make gridding locally.\nMapReduce+KVI \(MRK process the whole\ntable. In MRK, MapReduce is designed to work over one\ncontinuous sub-index-model table including all the SSs of\nthe accessed nodes in search operations. For instance, in Fig.\n4\(a or value  16, a >]. The same idea applies for point\nqueries. As compared to our hybrid KSM approach, MRK is\na lightweight indexing-MapReduce plan, as it processes many\nirrelevant SSs of nodes between So and V.\nFilter of key-value store \(FKV support\npredicate-based row selection. The filter transmits the filtering\npredicate to each region server and then all servers scan their\nlocal data in parallel. Afterwards, they return the qualified\ntuples. Our filter-based query processing also works on the\nindex-model table, as the filtering predicates can be directly\napplied to the columns. The query processor waits until all\n288\nFig. 5. Query performance of range and point queries\nregion servers finish scans and then it retrieves each returned\nqualified modeled segment to conduct gridding locally.\n1 a b c queries. As depicted in Fig.6\(a the query selectivity increases, the amount of SSs\nfor scan based processing decreases and that for MapReduce\napproaches the entire table. Therefore, the response time\nincreases and approaches that of MR. The response time of\nMR increases little. As increasing query selectivity leads to\nascending gridding workload in reduce phase, these results\nshow that the overhead from model gridding is not dominant\nin MR. The response time of MRK is more than that of KSM,\nbut less than that of MR. As MRK utilizes the KVI-index\nto localize a consecutive sub-index-model table covering all\nthe SSs of nodes found by intersection search, it processes\nfewer modeled segments than MR's full table scanning. Yet,\nas compared to KSM, MRK processes more redundant modeled\nsegments. Moreover, as the sub-table in MRK covers a large\nrange, the processing time of MRK increases little for low-\nselective queries.\nFig.6\(b FKV needs to wait for each region server of\nHBase to finish the local data scanning, its total response time\nis a little longer than that of IT approach. They both consume\nmuch more time than all MR, MRK and KSM 


as they apply\nsequential accessing of modeled segments.\nWe also analyse the number of modeled segments accessed\nby each approach in Fig. 6\(c segments affect\nthe performance. MR works on the entire table, thus, the\nnumber of accessed segments is the same. From the point\nof view of the application, only qualified modeled segments\nare returned for gridding thus FKV processes no redundant\nmodeled segments and consumes the least amount of modeled\nsegments. Since IT scans the SS of one node until encountering\nan unqualified model, the total number of accessed segments\nis a little larger than that of FKV. Our KSM processes larger\nnumber of segments than both IT and FKV due to the\ncontinuous and redundant range of SSs found by isearch+.\nHowever, the results also verify our theoretical analysis that\nthe amount of redundant modeled segments is bounded. MRK\naccesses more segments than IT, FKV and KSM, as it adds\nthe SSs between So and V to form a continuous sub-table\nfor MapReduce. Referring to Fig. 6\(a and Fig. 6\(b efficient.\nFig. 6 \(d e f approaches exhibit\nsimilar patterns as for the time range queries, so we skip the\ndetailed analysis.\n2 Query: The time and value point query processing\nperformance are shown in Fig. 6\(g value point queries. The response time of KSM is a little\ngreater than IT, but outperforms the other approaches, because\nIT is able to access all qualified modeled segments in one SS.\nHowever, the KSM scans the whole SS entries of a node to find\nthe qualified ones. Because of the invocation of MapReduce\nand redundant modeled segments in the sub-table, MRK takes\nmore time than both IT and KSM. But, as MRK does not work\non the entire table as MR does, it takes about 2 x less time\nthan MR. FKV consumes the most time as it needs to wait for\nserver-side full table scan before gridding operations. Since the\nsize of the domain of the sensor data values is smaller than\nthat of the time domain, nodes in value vs-tree accommodate\nmore modeled segments than time vs-tree nodes. Thus, the\nresponse times of value point queries of IT, FKV and KSM\napproaches are all more than those of time point queries. For\nMR and MRK, the processing time differences between time\nand value queries are insignificant, as the time spent on model\nfiltering and gridding is not dominant.\nD. Insights into KVI-Scan-MapReduce\nThis experiment aims to reveal how much time KSM spends\non model gridding, which is an additional step, as compared\nto querying raw sensor data. Due to space constraints, we only\nshow the results from time range queries of selectivity from\n10% to 50%. From Fig. 6\(h for 1/3 - 1/2 of the total processing time. As the\nmajority of the gridding work is performed in the reduce phase\nand the amount of qualified segments for reducers depends\non the query selectivity, the time spent on model gridding\nincreases with the query selectivity. If the model gridding can\nadapt to users' different requirements for query results, the\nperformance of KSM can be further improved.\n289\nFig. 6. Query performance a c d g g h constitution\nVII. CONCLUSION\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\nexplore the key-value representation of an interval index for\nmodel-view based sensor data management. Different from\nconventional external-memory index structure with complex\nnode merging and split mechanisms, our KVI-index resident\npartially in memory and partially materialized in the key-value\nstore, is easy to maintain in the dynamic sensor data generation\nenvironment. Moreover, we proposed a hybrid query pro-\ncessing approach, namely KVI-Scan-MapReduce, integrating\nthe KVI-index, range scan and MapReduce for model-view\nsensor data in key-value stores. Extensive experiments in a\nreal testbed showed that our approach outperforms in terms\nof query response time and index updating efficiency not only\nquery processing methods based on raw sensor data but also\nall other approaches considered based on model-view sensor\ndata for time/value range and point queries. As a future work,\nwe plan to explore how to process time and value composite\nqueries based on KVI-index.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. Sathe, T. G. Papaioannou, H. Jcung, and K.

We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
