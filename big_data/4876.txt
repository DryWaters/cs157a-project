Enhanced Semantic Automatic Ontology Enrichment Ali Harb LIST ENS des Mines de Saint Etienne 158 cours Fauriel 42023 Saint-Etienne France harb@emse.fr Kaìl Hajlaoui ERIC University of Lyon 2 5 Av Pierre Mends-France 69676 Lyon France Kaìl.Hajlaoui@univ-lyon2.fr Abstract With the fast growing development of the Web the adoption of ontologies to improve the exploitation of information resources is already heralded as a promising model of representation However the relevance of information that they contain requires regular updating and speciìcally the addition of new knowledge Recently new research approaches were deìned in order to automatically enrich ontology Usually they extensively use either statistical models or experts to provide the relevance and placement of new concepts Unfortunately these approaches suffer the following drawback The detection of new elements and position in ontology are not automatically established and lack of use of semantic or syntactic information to extract relations between concepts In this paper we present an approach for ontology enrichment based on two steps where a novel effective ltering step is utilized First we extract the correlation between terms of a learning dataset using the generation of association rules Second we retain the relevant new concepts using an extracted semantic information The suggested approach was tested on an ontology of mechanical industry competencies Experiments were performed on real data which show the usefulness of our approach Keywords Text mining Ontology Association Rules Mutual information Syntactic analysis I I NTRODUCTION Ontologies are a knowledge and reasoning representation They are the result of an organization process for the whole concepts in a speciìc eld as well as the relations between these concepts Ontology transmits an exhaustive and rigorous conceptualization of domain or eld into a mode able to be analyzed by various information technology methods To build an ontology for a speciìc eld we need an expert in order to transfer the domain knowledge into an ontological form 2 3 Ho we v e r  this manual process based on an expert is a fastidious and time consuming Thus the relevance of ontology information needs to be up to date In addition concept enrichment by the addition of new knowledge is essential In order to accelerate this endeavor and to remove any subjectivity recent research has been interested in semi-automatic and automatic techniques for ontology enrichment In literature most of work often used statistical or syntactical approaches to enrich their 5 6 7 8 Moreo v e r  many approaches integrated data mining techniques These approaches use neither semantic nor syntactic information to extract relations between concepts Also the detection of new elements and position in ontology are not automatically established In this article we suggest an automatic enrichment methodology for ontology based on combining two types of knowledge present in the initial ontological structure suitable for a eld and that extracted from a textual corpora The process of enrichment is based on the generation of association rules between terms that represent correlation which are validated by semantic information and statistical measurements This article is organized as follows in section 2 an outline of the techniques of enrichment of ontology is presented Third section describes our approach ontology enrichment by a generic base of associative rules Lastly this paper culminates with a conclusion as well as a description of our works in progress II S TATE OF THE ARTS The ontology enrichment process is composed of two steps the search for both new concepts and their relevant relations and secondly their placement in the ontology A Discovering potential conceptual term We distinguish two methods for the discovery candidates concepts the rst is based on statistical calculations using several measurements to select potential terms according to their distribution in corpora 7 10 such as comple x measurements such as mutual information tf-idf etc or the use of statistical laws of term distributions These v arious proposals enable identifying new enrichment terms candidate but do not allow placing them in ontology without a tiresome human intervention The second is a syntactic method which determines at determining the grammatical function of a word or a word group within a sentence It is based on the following assumption the grammatic structure reîect semantic dependences It uses the grammatical functions of a word or a word group to present new concepts They present the drawbacks of identifying only the relations 1113 978-1-4244-8136-1/10/$26.00 c  2010 IEEE 


labelized by verbs Other approaches use also syntactic patterns The e xtracted terms illustrate the ne w potential enrichment concepts B Concepts placement in ontology To place the provisional terms it is essential to detect the relations between these new terms and initial concept ontology propose a statistical approach based on the frequent co-occurrence of candidates terms with the concepts of initial ontology A lack of precision is noticed among the new concepts and the ontological structure Other approaches are based on data mining techniques  Se v eral approaches suggest using frequent correlations which exist among the corpora terms while using an extracted association rules among potential concepts 11  Each rule e xpresses the relation between tw o o r more concepts of the eld This enrichment process requires ltering considering the large number of rules generated Consequently human intervention is necessary to deìne the semantic relations discovered Other work 5 is based on the classiìcation methods in order to bring closer the candidates terms contained in the texts to the concepts present in ontology The principle is to gather by a method of clustering terms according to their number of occurrences within corpora The disadv antage of these approaches is that they do not detect the relations among the candidates terms i.e which unfortunately then requires a human intervention for the addition of these new terms III A PPROACH  Figure 1 The general process of our approach The purpose of this section is to present our approach The overall process is described in 1 It consists of three phases In the following sub-sections these three phases are presented in detail A Corpora preprocessing To extract and to preserve the context of sentences contained in the corpora initially obtained from web sites we manually built a list of stop words to be ltered e.g nbsp mailto next previous GIF jpg  These words are always frequent in the corpus in spite of the extraction text phase passage of the format HTML with the textual format This list is used to lter and clean the corpora According to the expert analysis of the eld for the initial ontology concepts and the texts of the companies describing the eld of ontology the choice of the words to be kept is according to three grammatical categories  Verb  Noun and Adjectif  In order to do that we treated morpho-syntactically the corpora using TreeTagger This application enables us to obtain the category and lemma of each word A ltering step according to these three categories was made to build a new corpora based on words considered grammatically relevant B Window size creation and concept extraction The objective is to search within the corpora the words which are correlated to the concepts of the ontology Perhaps a brief explanation of our use of the term window size is in order A window size is a set of words that surround concepts For this from the processed copora we seek correlations between concepts of ontology and words of documents to enrich the ontology with more relevant and useful words The question that arises at this point is How to search for words correlated to the concepts of ontology The answer consists in two steps 1 construction of Window size 2 generation of association rules Nevertheless in order to obtain more relevant concepts consider the following hypothesis the more a word is close to a initial concept the more likely this word has strong semantic correlation Thus sentences are deìned by considering window sizes WS A window size is a set of words that include one or more initial concept of ontology In other words as aforementioned a set of words that surround concepts Our goal is to identify in sentences how to represent these WS For instance if WS is set to 1 that means that a sentence is composed by one word before and one after the pivot concept Figure 2 Example of Window Size WS In gure 2 the pivot is stampings  Using WS whose size 1 we get the following transaction  stampings cuttings 1114 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 


and industrial  and by specifying a WS 2 stampings cuttings expertise industrial and process  These windows are the transactions for the next step The second step is the generation of the association rules In order to detect the semantic correlation between the terms in documents and the ontologyês concepts an association rule algorithm as adapted to our concern More formally let I   i 1  i n  a set of terms and D a set of sentences where each sentence corresponds to a subset of elements of I  An association rule is thus deìned as X  Y where X  I Y  I  and X  Y   The support of a rule corresponds to the percentage of sentences in D containing X  Y The rule X  Y has a conìdence ratio c if c  of sentences from D containing X also contain Y  C Filtering and Enrichment In order to minimize the number of false concepts learned the words found in documents that are in correlation with several different concepts are removed Indeed as a dictionary is not used by excluding words correlated to more than one concept only those words that are highly correlated with unique concepts should be retained After this phase we obtain a list of potential concepts learned However a problem persists what is the quality of words in this list In other words do the concepts learned correspond to real features or just noise The various experiments conducted have demonstrate that effectively it was necessary to follow the learning by a ltering step One of the most commonly measures used for nding the correlation between two words is the Cubic Mutual Information  MI  This measure depends on a conte xt c Given this context it is then based on three frequencies nb  x c  the number of co-occurrences of x and c nb  y c  co-occurrences of y and c nb  x y c  co-occurrences of x,y and c The measure then is computed with AcroDef MI 3 formula AcroDef MI 3  x y c  nb  x y   c  3  nb  x  c   nb  y  c  1 In our work we wish to compute the dependency between two concepts x and y In this case nb x y represents the number of web pages where x and y are present together The problem that persists is How to identify context To do this we will study the different situations of concepts and words learned We found that the major situations in which the concepts and words learned appear in are Subject Object Verb and adjectives The normal parsing of natural language does not detect these variants of categories For this a was used parser 1 that can generate the grammatical dependencies from which context can be 1 http://www.latl.unige.ch extracted Example Consider the concept stampings which is a concept of the original ontology After the generation of the previous steps the learned words which are correlated according to the association rules are cuttings  machining  Development and Client  Firstly we verify that there is no learned word as a concept of the original ontology For this the term machining is eliminated in this rst step By doing so we need to identify the context of each word so that we can generate the AcroDef MI 3 values Concerning the concept learned cuttings  its context in relation to the term stampings is sought When the collection of documents is mined where both words appear the following sentences are found  Our expertise is in  cuttings stampings and industrial plastic process  Transformation of metals by cutting stamping and welding  We make tools for cutting and stamping  Our competency is based on three areas of expertise cutting stamping and welding Based on the logical chaining of the grammatical dependencies rules we get the following information Competency expertise Metal tools transformation These terms forms the context of stamping and the word learned cuttings  To implement the correlation formula AcroDef MI 3  and to evaluate the three frequencies queries were posted to Google The formula is applied between the concept stampings and all words learned where it is correlated The values obtained are shown below  AcroDef MI 3 stampings cuttings C1  0.13462  AcroDef MI 3 stampings Development C2  0.03029  AcroDef MI 3 stampings client C3  4.9693E-005 Because of the numbers of pages indexed by google that changes from one word to another that prevent us from nding a threshold from which we can lter candidates Hence the rst potential concept listed by the lter AcroDef MI 3 is just accepted So the word cuttings is validated as a new concept and the others are removed IV E XPERIMENTATIONS In this section the results of the different experiments we conducted to validate our methodology are presented A Corpora To test our approach we used a corpora constituted by the texts of twenty companies in the mechanical industry our ontology describes competences of these companies This corpora was built by collecting documents from the web 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 1115 


sites Concepts found on these pages were cross-references with their corresponding codes according to NAF 2  The collection contains 11926 documents is our test corpora B Building an Ontology for competence traces 1 Normalisation The rst normalisation step is to render explicit the concepts of the knowledge domain These concepts should be expressed in the form of cognitive constructs which have a non-contextual meaning This allows the arrangement of various constructs into semantically interpretable formulations Proposed to identify such cognitive constructs by applying differentiation mechanisms among concepts These authors suggested applying four semantic differentiation principles to clarify the difference between each cognitive constructs and its parent constructs  Our objective is to engineer an ontology that deals with competence traces The normalisation procedure has been divided into three phases The rst automatically identiìes candidate terms for the ontology A corpus was extracted from mechanical industrial company web sites with the indexation tool SMART for this application Using this rst identiìcation of terms the second uses informal domain expertise asking several experts to provide an initial version of the potential organisation of the domain concepts conceptual classes and their relationships Here the experts thoughts have converged to two approaches First a topdown method offers a generic conceptualisation of the notion of competence traces We show in Figure 2 that the results are a so called generic ontology Second a bottom up approach which entails a pragmatic notion of competence traces closely linked to the activity led analysed mechanical industry This 2nd approach results in a enumerated part of the nal ontology called the domain ontology Finally a normalisation phase reduces ambiguities among the concepts identiìed and improves the formalisation of relationships among terms and their deìnitions The differentiation principles proposed by Bachimont were applied 2 Formalisation The formalisation structures the various levels of the ontology notably by deìning additional properties to the cognitive constructs identiìed previously The three main types are differentiated metaphysic structure and parataxic concepts These three types correspond also to distinct generality levels from the conceptual level of the ontology to the more pragmatic The rst level of the competence traces ontology is composed of very generic commonly called metaphysical concepts For this level the generic competence model must be created Two generic classes are deìned which correspond to the types of company capabilities of interest 2 It is one of the codes of INSEE it allows the coding of the principal activity carried on in the company or association We have code APE of 1973 to 1992 and code NAF since January 1st 1993 http://www.insee.fr/fr/nom  def met/nomenclatures/naf/pages/naf.pdf the classes technological competence traces and methodological competence traces The structuring level covers a set of interrelated concepts which should make possible to provide an enumerative and conceptual description of the knowledge domain These concepts have the advantage of being independent of the speciìc activity eld addressed Competence Traces Ontology CTO can be re-used for various company activity domains The third parataxic level of the ontology is constituted by what we called in 3.2.1 the domain ontology The competence trace concepts at that level are directly linked to the application eld mechanical industry sector When applying our approach to another industrial sector it is interesting to underline that the structuring level of the ontology remains stable and only the parataxic level has to be modiìed Furthermore the concept classes of this domain ontology are characterised by sets of class instances These instances correspond to speciìc terms of the domains used as competence trace identiìers They are directly used to extract the pertinent information which is composed of the company competence traces Figure 3 partially illustrates this domainês ontology Figure 3 Parataxic level of the ontology mechanical industry 3 Operationalisation This does implement a computer version of the ontology for the application of inference mechanisms We have employed the competence trace ontology using OWL Ontologie Web Language C List of initial ontology concepts The initial domain ontology contains a large number of concepts and the enrichment is a tedious task that requires a lot of time Consequently in a rst time we chose to test on a single conceptual domain of the initial ontology to measure the performance of our approach The initial list of concepts described in Table IV-C In order to study what might be the best distance between words and concepts to retain Different experiments were 1116 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications

in these semantic resources such as ontology are made manually In this paper we present a new approach of ontology enrichment based on data mining technics speciìcally the association rules and the use of extracted semantic information to retain relevant new concepts Our approach is based on three steps 1 Preprocessing of a textual corpora cleaning and lemmatising treetagger 2 Creating window size to promote the correlation between corpora words and concepts of the ontology then the application of the APRIORI algorithm to extract association rules according to validated parameters support conìdence 3 Automatic analysing and semantic ltering of generated rules to keep those that are relevant to the initial domain ontology The obtained enrichment results seem auspicious for the chosen domain ontology This approach is sensitive to the domain studied it is important to have a corpora that describes the subject domain accurately so there is a very rich language with nouns and adjectives available Although the company websites do not represent the ideal source for building a such corpora for the domain studied companies competency in the mechanical industry but we have had promising results R EFERENCES  G Berio and M Harzallah T o w ards an inte grating architecture for competence management in Special Issue Competence Management in Industrial Processes guest editors X Boucher E Bonjour N Matta Computers in Industry  vol V58 issue 2 2007  E Ermilo v a and H Afsarmanesh Modeling and management of proìles and competences in vbes Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing  vol V18 pp 561Ö586 2007  J Hodik J V okrinek J Biba and P  Becv ar  Competences and proìles management for virtual organizations creation CEEMAS  pp 93Ö102 2007  G Pepiot Modlisation des entreprises sur la base des comptences EPFL PhD Thesis   2005  K Neshatian and Hejazi T e x t cate gorization and classiìcation in terms of multi-attribute concepts for enriching existing ontologies Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Information Technology and its Disciplines  pp 43Ö48 2004  L D Jorio L Abrouk C Fiot D  Hrin and M T eisseire Enrichissement dêontologie bas sur les motifs squentiels Actes de la Plateforme AFIA 2007 Atelier Ontologies et gestion de lêhtrognit smantique  2007  A F  A and R Steinmetz Ontology enrichment with te xts from the www Proceedings of the 2nd Semantic Web Mining Workshop at ECMLI/PKDD WSê02  2006  G Stumme and A H B Berendt Semantic web mining  State of the art and future directions Web Semantics  Science Services and Agents on the World Wide Web  vol 4 n 2 pp 124Ö143 2006  E Agirre O Ansa E Ho vy  and D Martinez Enriching very large ontologies using the www Proceedings of ECAI 2000 workshop on Ontology Learning  2002  V  P arekh and J G T  Finin Mining domain speciìc te xts and glossaries to evaluate and enrich domain ontologies Proceedings of the International Conference of Information and Knowledge Engineering  2004  R Bendaoud Construction et enrichissement dêune ontologie partir dêun corpus de textes Actes des Rencontres des Jeunes Chercheurs en Recherche dêInformation RJCRIê06 Lyon  pp 353Ö358 2006  A M V  Pekar and S Staab On disco v ering taxonomic relations from the web Journal of Information Retrieval Contextual Information Retrieval Systems  vol Springer Verlag pp 301Ö322 2002  N Hernandez J Chrisment and D Egret Modeling conte xt through domain ontologies Journal of Information Retrieval Contextual Information Retrieval Systems  vol 10 pp 143 172 2007  R Srikant and R Agra w al Mining generalized association rules Future Generation Computer Systems  vol 13 n 23 pp 161Ö180 1997  E Han and G Karypis Centroid based document classiìcation  Analysis and experimental results Proceedings of The 4th European Conference of Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery  pp 424Ö431 2000  K.Hajlaoui X.Boucher  and J J Girardot Competenc y ontology for network building 10th IFIP Working Conference on Virtual Entreprises PRO-VEê09  vol Thessaloniki GREECE 2009  H Schmid Probabilistic part-of-speech tagging using decision trees Conference on New Methods in Language Processing Manchester UK  1994  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases VLDBê94  1994  D Do wne y  M Broadhead and O Etzioni Locating complex named entities in Web text In Proceedings of the IJCAI07  pp 2733Ö2739 2007  M Roche and V  Prince  Acrodef  A quality measure for discriminating expansions of ambiguous acronyms CONTEXT  pp 411Ö427 2007  B B B A Isaac and R T ronc y  Semantic commitment for designing ontologies In the proceedings of 13th EKAW Conference LNAI of LN  vol Artiìcial Intelligence Springer 2473 pp 114Ö121 2002 1118 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
