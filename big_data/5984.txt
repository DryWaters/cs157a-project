Mining Association Rules Using Fast Algorithm M.Anandhavalli     Sandip Jain    Abhirup Chakraborti   Nayanjyoti Roy   M.K.Ghose Department of Computer Science Engineering Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology East Sikkim, India anandhigautham@yahoo.com, sunny20053@rediffmail.com, achakraborti88@gmail.com nayanroy@gmail.com Abstract The most time consuming operation in Priori-like algorithms for association rule mining is the computation of the frequency of the occurrences of itemsets \(called candidates database. In this paper, a fast algorithm has been proposed for generating frequent itemsets without generating candidate itemsets and association rules with multiple consequents. The proposed algorithm uses Boolean vector with relational AND operation to discover frequent itemsets. Experimental results shows that combining Boolean Vector and relational AND operation results in quickly discovering of frequent itemsets and association rules as compared to general Apriori algorithm Keywords- Association Rule Mining \(ARM itemsets; Boolean vector; relational AND operation I.  INTRODUCTION Association rule mining has been investigated by many researchers and practitioners for many years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Association rules are used to identify relationships among a set of items in database. These relationships are not based on inherent properties of the data themselves \(as with functional dependencies items. In this setting, attributes which represents items are assumed to have only two attributes and thus referred as Boolean attributes. If an item is contained in a transaction, the corresponding attribute value will be 1; otherwise the value will be 0. ARM is undirected or unsupervised data mining over variable-length data and it produces clear and understandable results. It has an elegantly simple problem statement: to find the set of all subsets of items or attributes that frequently occur in many database records or transactions, and additionally, to extract rules on how a subset of items influence the presence of another subset. A huge calculation and a complicated transaction process are required during the two procedures Therefore mining the Apriori-like algorithms [6] is very unsatisfactory when transaction database is very large In this paper, an algorithm has been proposed to generate 


frequent itemsets without candidate itemsets generation and also generation of association rules with multiple consequents using Boolean vector and AND operation methods II. MATERIALS & METHODS A. Association Rule Mining The Apriori-like algorithms adopt an iterative method to discover frequent itemsets. The process of discovering frequent itemsets need multiple passes over the data. The algorithm starts from frequent 1-itemsets until all maximum frequent itemsets are discovered. The Apriori-like algorithms consist of two major procedures: the join procedure and the prune procedure. The join procedure combines two frequent kitemsets, which have the same \(k-1 k+1 itemset as a new preliminary candidate. Following the join procedure, the prune procedure is used to remove from the preliminary candidate set all itemsets whose k-subset is not a frequent itemsets [6]. From every frequent itemset of k>=2 two subsets A and C, are constructed in such a way that one subset C, contains exactly one item in it and remaining k-1 items will go to the other subset A. By the downward closure properties of the frequent itemsets these two subsets are also frequent and their support is already calculated. Now these two subsets may generate a rule A C, if the confidence of the rule is greater than or equal to the specified minimum confidence B. Data Preprocessing Preprocessing is often required before applying any data mining algorithms to improve performance of the results. The preprocessing procedures are used to scale the data value either 0 or 1. We use the following method for transforming the database into Boolean values is given in Fig.1           Figure 1. Data preprocessing method  


The raw database rdb is a  m x n matrix where m is the number of transactions and  n is the number of attributes. bdb is the resultant Boolean matrix. rdb[i,j] denotes item at the i th  row and j th column of the initial matrix. bdb[i,j] denotes item at the i th row and j th column of the resultant matrix C.  Algorithm For Frequent Itemset Generation 1 Let I={i1, i2, , in} be a set of items, where each item ij corresponds to a value of an attribute and is a member of some attribute domain Dh={d1, d2, , ds i.e. ij  Dh. If I is a binary attribute, then the 1. For all i<=m  do 2. for all j<=n do 3.    if j th item is present in i th row 4.           Set rdb[i,j] =1 5.       else 6.            set rdb[i,j] =0 7.  End do 8. End do 400978-1-4244-4791-6/10/$25.00 c2010 IEEE Dom\(I containing transactions in the form of \(d, E Dom\(D Let D be a transaction database, n be the number of transactions in D, and minsup be the minimum support of D. The new_support is defined as new_support minsup  n Proposition 1: By Boolean vector with AND operation if the sum of 1 in a row vector Bi is smaller than k, it is not necessary for Bi to involve in the calculation of 


the k- supports Proposition 2: According to [7], Suppose Itemsets X is a k-itemsets; |FK-1\(j in the frequent set FK-1. There is an item j in X. If FK-1\(j itemsets Proposition 3: |FK| presents the number of k-itemsets in the frequent set FK. If |FK| is smaller than k+1, the maximum length frequent itemsets is k The proposed algorithm for finding the frequent itemsets without candidate generation consists of following four steps 1. Transforming the similarity matrix into the Boolean matrix 2. Generating the set of frequent 1-itemsets F1 3. Pruning the Boolean matrix 4. Generating the set of frequent k-itemsets FK\(k>1 A detailed description of the proposed algorithm for finding frequent itemset is described in Fig. 2                         


             Figure 2. Algorithm for frequent itemset generation D. Algorithm for Generation of Association Rules This algorithm is used to generate association rules from the already generated frequent itemsets \(by algorithm 2 takes minimum confidence from the user and discovers all rules with a fixed antecedent and with different consequent This algorithm uses the fact that:  If there exists two rules AC and A{C? X} where X ? A ? C then the confidence of the second cannot be larger than the first one This algorithm checks if a given set is a subset of another set or not. To perform this operation each item in an itemset is represented as an integer where a bit corresponding to as item is set to 1. For example suppose a database with 8 attributes itemset {1,2, 5}  is represented as 38 as follows. 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 To check if set {2,5} is a subset of {1,2,5} we represent 2,5} like above and is evaluated to 36. Now we perform AND operation 38 & 36. The result is checked for equality with the first itemset \({2, 5 otherwise it is not. In this case the result is obvious. Similarly difference of two sets is done during production of the rules This algorithm is capable of finding all association rules with a fixed antecedent and with different consequents from the frequent itemsets subject to a user specified minimum confidence very quickly. The proposed algorithm is avoiding the unnecessary checking for the rules based on the above lemma 1.The algorithm generate the rules with a fixed antecedent part. When all the rules with that antecedent are generated it will go to the next antecedent. For a given Input: The transaction database bdb

items in the consequent, have confidence less than the threshold, i.e.  no rules are generated, and then the confidence of any rule in k+1 level also cannot be more than threshold. So checking for rules from this level onward can be avoided without missing any rules. Now the maximum possible confidence of the rule in the k+1 level will be minimum confidence of the two itemsets from which this is constructed Since the confidence of only one of them is larger than the threshold, others must be less than the threshold. So the confidence of the rule in k+1 will be less than threshold. So, it is not necessary to check for the rules in the next level without missing any valid rule. So it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm is complete                         Figure 3. Algorithm for association rule generation III.

project [8] has been conducted to study the impact of normalization and to compare the effect of proposed algorithm with Apriori algorithm. Figure 4 gives the experimental results for execution time \(generating frequent itemsets and finding rules response time of the proposed algorithm is much better than that of the Apriori algorithm. In this case, confidence value is set 90% for the rule generation, which means that all the rules generated are true in 90% of the cases  Figure 4.

Association rules and Minsup in Proposed algorithm The number of association rules decreases along with an increase in minimum support under a given specific minimum confidence, which shows an appropriate Minsupport \(or Minconfidence and avoid the occurrence of some association rules so that it cannot yield a decision. These results have shown in Figures 6 and 7. The results are as expected and quite consistent with our intuition IV. CONCLUSION In this paper, a novel method of mining frequent itemsets and faster generation of association rules has been proposed to generate frequently occur itemsets very quickly. The proposed algorithm does not produce candidate itemsets, it spends less time for calculating k-supports of the itemsets with the Boolean matrix pruned, and it scans the database only once and needs less memory space when compared with Apriori algorithm The proposed algorithm is good enough for generating association rules from spatial gene expression data very fast and memory efficient. Finally, the large and rapidly increasing compendium of data demands data mining approaches particularly association rule mining ensures that genomic data mining will continue to be a necessary and highly productive field for the foreseeable future V.

The Performance Comparison In this subsection, we would like to study the effectiveness of the max-?rst traversal strategy for real-world data sets First, as can be seen in Fig. 4, due to the ?ltering effect of the upper bound and the pruning effect of the max-?rst traversal procedure, TOP-MATA consumes much less execution time than the brute-force method. This is particularly true for small ? values. As ? grows, the gap becomes smaller 50 150 250 350 450 550 0 0.5 1 1.5 K Ex ec ut io n tim e\(s ec    Brute?force TOP?MATA a 100 400 700 1000 1300 1600 0 10 20 30 40 50

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
