INTRODUCTION\nThe deregulation of electric power grids offers the oppor-\ntunity for electricity market participants to exercise least-cost\nor pro?t-based operations [1]. Despite of the market-driven\ntendency of the electric power business, security remains to\nbe a signi?cant concern of sustainable power system opera-\ntions which cannot be compromised. The security-constrained\noptimal power ?ow SCOPF   postulated\ncontingency constraints. It is an important management task\npromising to optimal control of power systems securely.\nThe SCOPF is an extension of the conventional optimal\npower ?ow \(OPF  objective is to determine\na generation schedule that minimizes the system operating cost\nwhile satisfy the system operation constraints such as hourly\nload demand, fuel limitation, environmental constraints and\nnetwork security requirements. It has been recognized [5] that\nthe optimal control of the normal state may violate the system\noperation constraints after the occurrence of the event of a\nmajor disturbance or contingency, and thus jeopardize the se-\ncurity of power systems. To address this problem, the SCOPF\nis performed by considering both pre-contingency and post-\ncontingency constraints to guarantee sustainable operations\nof the electric grid. An illustration of the SCOPF is shown\nin Fig. 1. The system security level is improved by taking\ninto account a number of contingencies in a dedicate selected\ncontingency list. The solution to the SCOPF should satisfy the\nso called N?1 criterion, which requires the operational limits\nof the power system should not be violated in case of a single\nŽ????????????E\n\nŽ?????????????\n\nŽ?????????????\nŽ?????????????\n\n\n??????\n nŽ?????????>???\nFig. 1. The system security level is improved by solving the SCOPF which\ntakes into account a number of contingency cases in a dedicate selected\ncontingency list.\ncontingency line and/or generator outage variables are restricted to their pre-\ncontingency condition settings, and corrective, whose control\nvariables are allowed to be rescheduled [6]. We will focus\non the corrective model in this paper. The seminal paper 5]\nproposed the generalized Benders decomposition method to\nsolve the corrective SCOPF. Since then, an extensive litera-\nture exists for SCOPF in power systems both for traditional\noperations and under market environments [7]–[10], [13]. The\nnested Benders decomposition method is utilized in [7] to\nsolve the SCOPF for determining the optimal daily generation\nscheduling in a pool-organized electricity market, and is tested\nin an actual example of the Spanish power system. [8] embed-\nded the SCOPF into the security-constrained unit commitment\n\(SCUC period which balanced\nthe economics and security in the restructured markets. An\niterative approach is proposed in [9] to obtain the solution\nof SCOPF, which aims to ef?ciently identify a as small as\npossible superset of the binding contingencies to achieve the\nSCOPF optimum. [10] applied the Benders decomposition\nto decompose the traditional SCOPF, and the underlying\ncomputational complexity is analyzed in this approach 13]\nsolved the SCOPF by a non-decomposed method based on\nthe compression of the post-contingency networks which can\nreduce the size of the security constraints and relieve the\nIEEE SmartGridComm 2013 Symposium - The Whole Picture - Sense, Communicate, Compute, Control978-1-4799-1526-2/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 774\ncomputational burden in the problem.\nThe SCOPF is computationally intensive due to the signi?-\ncantly large problem size the stringent real-time requirement\nand the huge number of various post-contingency states.\nAdditionally, the anticipated smart grid data deluge, gener-\nated by the sensing and measurement devices and reinforced\nby communication and information technologies, makes the\nproblem more complicated. To ensure the ef?cient and secure\noperations of the entire grid, we propose a distributive and\nparallel approach to solve the SCOPF by

The\nproposed algorithm is described in Section III and numerical\ntests are given in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes the\npaper.\nII. PROBLEM FORMULATION\nBefore presenting the formulation of the optimization prob-\nlem, it is useful to recall a general formulation of the conven-\ntional SCOPF problem compactly described as follows:\nminimize\nx0,...,xC u0,...,uC\nf0\(x0,u0 1 x0,u0 2 x0,u0 3 xc,uc 4 xc,uc 5 6 social welfare or equivalently minimize the offer-\nbased energy and production cost. xc is the vector of state\nvariables, which includes magnitude and voltage angle at all\nbuses, and uc is the vector of control variables, which can\nbe generators’ real power or terminal voltage. The superscript\nc = 0 corresponds to the pre-contingency con?guration, and\nc = 1, . . . , C corresponds to different post-contingency con?g-\nurations respectively. ?c is the maximal allowed adjustments\nof the control variables between the normal and contingency\nstates.\nIn the conventional SCOPF problem, the equality constraints\ngc, c = 0, . . . , C represent the system nodal power ?ow\nbalance over the entire gird, and inequality constraints hc, c =\n0, . . . , C stand for the physical limits on the equipments,\nsuch as the operational limits on the branch currents and\nbounds on the generators’ power output.

Note\nthat there are some variations on the objective function and\nconstraints of the SCOPF problem, and we focus on the\nconventional formulation in this paper.\nFollowing the standard approach of formulating SCOPF\nproblem, the objective here is to minimize generation cost\nwhile safeguard power system sustainability. For the sake of\nsimplicity and computational tractability, constraints 2 5 DC power network\nmodeling and neglecting all shunt elements, the standard\nSCOPF problem above can be simpli?ed to the following\noptimization problem:\nminimize\n?0,...,?C ;Pg,0,...,Pg,C\n?\ni?G\nfgi \(P\ng,0\ni 7 B0bus?\n0 +Pd,0 ?Ag,0Pg,0 = 0, \(8 9 10 0, \(11 12 13 14 15 7 while\nguaranteing the power system security, by taking into account\na set of postulated contingencies. The major challenge of\nthe SCOPF is the size of the problem, especially for large\nsystems with numerous contingency cases to be considered.\nIEEE SmartGridComm 2013 Symposium - The Whole Picture - Sense Communicate, Compute, Control775\nDirectly solving the SCOPF by simultaneously imposing all\npost-contingency constraints will result in prohibitive memory\nrequirements and huge CPU burden. To achieve ef?cient and\nsecure operations of the entire electrical grid, a distributed\nand parallel optimization algorithm is designed to solve the\nSCOPF in large-scale power systems in the next section.\nIII. PROPOSED ALGORITHM\nIn this section, a distribute algorithm is proposed to solve the\nSCOPF by decomposing it to a set of simpler and parallel sub-\nproblems corresponds to the base case and each contingency\ncase, respectively. The approach is based on the ADMM [14],\n[15], whose general form is described as follows:\nminimize\nx,z\nf\(x z 16 Ax+Bz = c, \(17 convex and proper.\nThe scaled augmented Lagrangian can be expressed as:\nL?\(x, z x z c+ ??22, \(18 variable, x and z are updated in\na Gauss-Seidel fashion. At each iteration k, the update process\ncan be 


expressed as:\nx[k + 1] = argmin\nx\nf\(x    z  Bz? c+ ?[k]?22.\nFinally, the scale dual variable is updated by:\n?[k + 1] = ?[k] +Ax[k + 1] +Bz[k + 1]? c.\nThe idea of ADMM for optimization in power systems has\nbeen used by Ross Baldick [11] and by Stephen Boyd 12].\nThe optimization problem \(7 14 couples the pre-\ncontingency and post-contingency variables together, and the\ninequality form makes the problem even more complicated.\nTo address these challenges, the optimization problem \(7 by introducing a slack variable pc ?

Remark that in the ADMM framework for distributed\ncomputing the dual variables, or price, are not uniformly set\nfor all nodes, which will require costly synchronization. For\nthe convex optimization problem, ADMM converges to the\noptimum geometrically [16], and the convergence rate will be\nsigni?cantly enhance by using the warm start technique [17].\nIV. NUMERICAL TESTS\nIn this section, the numerical tests are given to evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm. Three classical test\nsystems are used the formulate the SCOPF problem: IEEE 57\nbus IEEE 118 bus and IEEE 300 bus, whose structures and\ncharacteristics are summarized in Table II [18].\nTwo kinds of contingencies are considered in numerical\ntests: branch outage and generator failure. The contingencies\nare arti?cially generated and the number of contingencies\nconsidered are listed in Table II. We follow the physical limits\non the equipments of test systems and assume every active\ngenerator is able to reschedule up to 50% of its maximum\nreal power capacity. The numerical tests are implemented via\nMATLAB 7.10 on a PC with an Intel Q8200 2.33GHz and\n8GbB memory. The basic OPF solver is the same for all test\nsystems. The performance of the convergence and computing\ntime of the proposed algorithm are investigated in the follow-\ning parts. The numerical tests results are averaged out across\na total number of 500 Monte Carlo implementations.\nA Convergence Performance\nWe ?rst consider the convergence issue of the proposed\nalgorithm. Since the number of contingencies and the optimal\nvalue for each test system are different, the relative error is\nused here to demonstrate the results. Suppose r[k] is the result\nof the value of objective function at the kth iteration and\nr? is the optimal solution. The relative error e is de?ned as\ne = | r[k]?r\n?\nr[0]?r? |. The convergence 


performances are shown in\nFig. 2. It is shown that after a moderate number of iterations,\nthe proposed algorithm converges to the optimal values in\ndifferent cases. From Fig. 2, we can see that the test system\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n?0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nNumber of Iterations\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \nE\nrr\nor\nIEEE case57\nIEEE case118\nIEEE case300\nFig. 2. Convergence performance of proposed algorithm on test systems.\nIEEE 57 bus has the fastest convergence rate. This is mainly\ndue to the small scale of the test system as well as the number\nof the contingencies in the system. A large system leads to a\nlarge scale optimization problem, and the numerous number\nof contingencies considered will make the problem scale even\nlarger. Note that after very few iterations, the optimization\nresult are very close to the optimal value, which means that\nthe proposed algorithm are able to yield a good approximation\nto the optimal value in a short time.\nB. Computing Time Performance\nIn this part, we compare the computing time of the pro-\nposed algorithm with the centralized approach to SCOPF. The\ncomputing time to obtain the optimal solution are considered\nin both cases. The computing time to achieve an approximate\nsolution with a relative error e = 1% is also considered for\nthe distributed case. To better illustrate numerical results, the\nspeedup factor is de?ned as Sp = Tc/Tp, where Tc is the\ncomputing time of the centralized approach, and Tp is the\ncomputing time of the distributed approach.\nThe results of the computing time performance are pre-\nsented in Table III. It is shown in Table III that the pro-\nposed distributed approach obtains the same optimum as\nthe centralized approach, and can achieve a speedup factor\nSp = 1.4 ? 2.4. Remark that if only an approximated\nresult is needed, the speedup factor can even be improved\nto Sp = 4.4 ? 4.8 by the proposed distributed algorithm.\nThe speedup factor for the smallest test system, IEEE 57 bus,\nis the smallest. This is due to the communication overhead\nbetween different computing nodes during the simulations. A\nlarger Sp can be achieved on a large-scale test system because\nthe communication overhead is negligible compared with the\ncomputing time of the optimization subproblem handled by\neach computing nodes.\nThe performance of computing time for the test systems\nwith different numbers of contingency cases are also in-\nIEEE SmartGridComm 2013 Symposium - The Whole Picture - Sense, Communicate Compute, Control777\n1h 20 30 40 50\n100\n101\nNumer of Contingencies\nC\nom\npu\nta\ntio\nn \nT\nim\ne\nCentralized Algorithm\nProposed Algortihm\n\(a Contingencies\nC\nom\npu\nta\ntio\nn \nT\nim\ne\nCentralized Algorithm\nProposed Algorithm\n\(b IEEE 118 bus\n20 40 60 80 100\n102\nNumber of Contingencies\nC\nom\npu\nta\ntio\nn \ntim\ne\nCentralized Algorithm\nDistributed Algorithm\n\(c systems with different number of contingency cases\nTABLE III\nCOMPUTING TIME PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM ON\nDIFFERENT TEST SYSTEMS\nCases Centralized Distributed ADMM\nCost Time Cost Time Cost \(e\n 1 7.93\nIEEE 300 bus 9567.12 221.67 9567.12 95.74 9662.80 52.87\nvestigated and the results are given in Fig. 3 The number\nof contingencies are increased by 20% each time and the\ncomputing time is recorded. It is shown in the ?gure that\nwith the increase of the number of contingency cases in\nthe SCOPF, the computing time of the centralized algorithm\nincreases much faster than the proposed algorithm. Thus, the\nproposed distribute algorithm is more scalable and stable than\nthe centralized approach.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe SCOPF has become an essential tool for operators of\npower systems for operation planning and real time operation\nof their system The signi?cantly large problem size, the strin-\ngent real-time requirement and the variety of numerous post-\ncontingency states make the SCOPF a challenging problem\nto solve. In this paper, we propose a distributive parallel\napproach based on the ADMM to deal with the resultant big\ndata scale optimization problem with manageable complexity.\nSpeci?cally, The original SCOPF problem is decoupled and\ndivided into independent subproblems of approximately the\nsame size correspond to each individual pre-contingency and\npost-contingency case. Subproblems are optimized in a parallel\nfashion on distributed nodes and dual price effectiveness of proposed algorithm.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Shahidehpour, W. F. Tinney, and Y.

Codeword buffering delay – we assume the \ncodeword frame synchronization mechanism will \nrequire 3 code frames to acquire and to confirm \nframe sync.  Let R denote the data rate.  Thus the \ncodeword buffering delay for DSN missions and \nSN/NEN missions are 3x2048/R and 3x4500/R \nrespectively \(in unit of seconds 


Frame buffering delay – we assume a Space Link \nExtension \(SLE acquired and confirmed in one frame.  \nThus the frame buffering delay is 10240/R \(in unit \nof seconds Ground transmission delay – from prior statistics \nfor DSN data delivery over the NISN lines, we \nobserve that the long-haul latency between DSN \nsites and JPL Central is approximately 2 times the \npropagation delay.  As ground transmission latency \nis a small fraction compared to the other delays, we \nuse the rough estimation of two times propagation \ndelay to model the ground transmission delay.   \n \nUsing the Straight-Forward Leveling Scheme we estimate \nthe link sizes of the network paths of the four ISE options \nfor the “base” case and high” case traffic scenarios, both \nfor bulk science latency requirements of 1 hour and 8 hours nrespectively.  The aggregated WAN bandwidths of the four \nISE options for both cases are given in Tables 1 and 2.   \n \n \nTable 1: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Straight-Forward \nLeveling Scheme \n \n \nTable 2: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Eight Hours, Straight-Forward \nLeveling Scheme \n \nSimilarly we apply the 2-State Markov Leveling Scheme, \nand the aggregated WAN bandwidths of the four ISE \noptions for the base and high cases are given in Table 3 \n\(with bulk science latency of 1 hour with bulk \nscience latency of 8 hours Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps nTable 4: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Scheme \n \nTo validate the accuracy of the leveling schemes, we choose \nthe DSN’s GSS-MOC links for the ISE option-1 for the case \nwhen the bulk science latency requirement is one hour, and \ncompare the bandwidth estimates generated by the Straight-\nForward Leveling Scheme and those generated by direct \nsimulation using MACHETE10.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6. The WAN bandwidths of ISE-3 and ISE-4 are \nmuch higher than those of ISE-1 and ISE-2.   \n \n \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
