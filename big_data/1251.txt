INTRODUCTION  \nThe explosive growth of information stored in unstructured \ntexts created a great demand for new and powerful tools, such \nas text mining techniques, to acquire interesting information. \nText mining refers generally to a process of extracting useful \ninformation and knowledge from unstructured textual \ndocuments [1]. In order to take advantage of the learning, lots \nof text mining technologies have been researched on. \nDocument clustering is one of the powerful text mining \nmethods that represent a set of mixed documents written in nnatural language in an organized, synthetic and uniform way. \nMore accurately, document clustering aims to respond to \nhuman interests and needs during his information searching \nand understanding [2] by segmenting documents into a set of \nmeaningful clusters for which documents in the same cluster \nare similar among themselves and dissimilar to those belonging \nto other clusters. \nNevertheless, the clustering process cannot be directly \napplied on textual documents. An indexing procedure, mapping \neach textual document of the dataset into a compact \nrepresentation of its content, needs to be uniformly applied. \nThe most commonly used representation is the vector space \nmodel [3]. However, this presentation generates a dataset with \nbillion terms which makes the employment of clustering \nalgorithms challenged. On one hand, most clustering ntechniques don't work efficiently in high dimensional data \nsince they become meaningless and the documents are almost \nequidistant from each other [4]. On the other hand, some of the \ndimensions are redundant and irrelevant. These features can \nmisguide the clustering result especially when they outnumber \nthe relevant ones [3] [4] [5]. Under such circumstances, \ndownsizing the dataset by selecting the most discriminative and nrepresentative features before applying any clustering \nalgorithm becomes an important issue. \nDimensionality reduction is the process of decreasing the \ndimension of the dataset to a manageable size keeping as much \nas possible the original information. Depending on the nature \nof the resulting features, dimensionality reduction techniques \ncan be divided into feature extraction and feature selection \ntechniques.  The first method refers to the mapping of the \noriginal high-dimensional data onto a lower dimensional space. \nHence the information from the irrelevant features is kept and \nthe interpretation of the new attributes that are a combination \nof the originals is difficult. In contrast to this, the second \nmethod chooses an optimal subset of features according to an \nobjective function. Following this procedure, the over-fitting \nphenomenon can be avoided [3], the application of learning \nmethods become significantly easier [6] and text categorization nperformances will improve [5] [7]. Because of these reasons, \nfeature selection techniques are the most proper techniques for \nsolving efficiently the problem of dimensionality. \nSeveral studies have focused on feature selection methods \nand used them over the clustering process. Authors in [8], uses \na new frequency feature selection method called Third moment \nwhich has an ability to enhance rare features. Similarly, a nstrategy called CMFS was proposed in [9], it comprehensively \nmeasures the significance of a term by calculating its \nsignificance from both inter-category and intra-category. \nAnother statistical method was introduced in [5]; based on the \nwell known chi-square metric, the CHIR statistic keeps only \nterms those are positively dependant to the categories. Authors \nin [10] use the CHIR statistic in a novel feature selection nmethod relying on the Meta heuristic algorithm Ant Colony \nOptimization. \nHowever, all these methods are frequency feature selection \ntechniques. An interesting research topic is to perform a \nclustering document using not only a statistical feature \nselection method but also a semantic one. It was in fact proven \nthat using a semantic feature selection technique improves the \nclustering that had already been performed using statistical \nfeature selection method [11]. Hence, motivated by the studies \nutilizing the combination of co-occurrence terms techniques \nand the semantic similarity between words [11] [12] [13], we \npropose a 


clustering algorithm that extends and performs the \ntext clustering algorithm TCFS proposed in [5]. The novelty \nlies in the new semantic feature selection method SIM we \npropose and the combination of statistical and semantic \ninformation to pilot the clustering algorithm. In fact, we \npropose a document clustering through two stages: a statistical \nclustering followed by a semantic one. The statistical weight of \neach term is estimated by the CHIR-statistic [5] and the \nsemantic weight is estimated using a new measure based on the nmutual information. The clustering and feature selection \nprocesses are done in parallel order. The experimental results \nshow that our algorithm allows us to select only terms which \nare statistically and semantically relevant and the clustering \nalgorithm’s performances are significantly improved. \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 \nwe present a brief overview of the CHIR method and propose a nnew semantic feature selection method, called SIM. In section \n3, we describe our clustering algorithm that selects iteratively \nrelevant features and performs clustering until convergence. \nFinally, in section 4, we present the corpora on which we \nevaluate our algorithm’s performance and discuss the obtained \nresults. \nII MATERIALS AND METHODS \nA. Background Knowledge \nThe most commonly document representation employed is \nthe vector space model [3]. In this model, each document is \nconsidered as a term-weight vector. For determining the weight \nof a term in a document, we choose the standard Term \nFrequency-Inverse Document Frequency function that is \ngenerally used [3]. In this case, the representation of a \ndocument ? is: \n???????   ?  ???1 1? , ??2 ??? ?\n?\n??2\n? , … , ??? ??? ? ??????  \(1 document d?, idf? \nis the number of documents that contain the term i, n is the \ntotal number of documents in the collection, and D is the \ndimension of the text database. Finally, since documents have \ndifferent lengths, each term vector is normalized to a unit \nlength. \nIn each clustering algorithm, the similarity between two \ndocuments must be measured. Different measures exist for this \npurpose, but the most common one is the cosine function [14]. \nIn fact, for high-dimensional, all Euclidean techniques \nperformed poorly contrary to cosine function that is successful \nin capturing the similarities between documents [14]. In naddition, cosine similarity is easy to interpret and simple to \ncompute especially when the term vectors are normalized to a \nunit length. For two documents ??and ?? the cosine similarity \nbetween them is calculated as n??????, ??? ?  ????????? ????                            \(2 d? to the length \nof the vector d. When two documents are identical, the cosine \nvalue is equal to 1, and it takes the value 0 when the documents \nare totally dissimilar and have nothing in common. Larger \ncosine values indicate that these two documents are likely \nsimilar since they share most of their words. \nB. CHIR Method nCHIR is a new feature selection technique introduced in [5] \nand based on the ?? statistic. In order to select only relevant \nterms that have strong positive dependency on certain \ncategories in the dataset, [5 propose a new measure ??,? that \ndetermines whether the dependency between two attributes is \npositive or negative. It is defined as: \n??,? ?  ???,?????,??                                      \(3 the observed frequency of the documents that \nbelong to the category c and contain w. ???, ?? is the expected nfrequency of the category c and the term w. If the term w and \nthe category c are independent, ??,? is close to 1. If there is a \npositive dependency, ??,? is larger than 1 and when there is a \nnegative dependency is smaller than 1. To define the term \ngoodness of a term w in a dataset with m classes, they combine \nthe measure and the ??,??  statistic as follows: \n??? ?  ? ????,??? ????                                \(4 nwhere 1                  \(5 the category. \nThe steps of the CHIR algorithm to select l terms are: \n1. Calculate the ??? statistic for each term in the \ndataset.  \n2. Sort the terms in descending order of their term \ngoodness. \n3. Select the top l terms from the list. \nC. SIM Method \nThe mutual information is a widely used measure in \nstatistic and information theory. Two terms are considered \nsimilar if their mutual information with all terms in the nvocabulary is nearly the same [15]. To measure the similarity \nbetween two terms w and ??we use the following metric [15]: \n?????, ??? ? ??|?|  ?\n????????,??,????,????\n????????,??,????,????\n n?,????\n???????,???,????,????\n|?|\n???    \(6 mutual \ninformation between the terms w and ?? which is calculated by \nthe following formula: \n n??\n??????????                 \(7 probability of \nsuccession of the terms w and ?? in a window of d?1 words. \n P?w? and P???? are respectively the a priori probability of the \nterms w and ??.  \nThe similarity between a term w and a document \ncentroïd  d is defined in [16] as the average of the similarities \nbetween the term w and the m terms of the document centroïd. \nThis measure is given by: \n?????, ??  ?  ? ?????,???\n????\n? ? ?????????? ,???????\n 8 


weighted sum of its \nsimilarities with the document centroïd of each cluster through \nthe following formula n??????  ?  ? ?????, ???? ?????, ???????            \(9 between the \nterm w and the document centroïd ?? and ???, ??? is the mutual \ninformation between them. The mutual information criterion is \ndefined by: \n???, ??  ?  ???, ?? ???? ???,???????????             \(10 there is a genuine association between w and d then the \njoint probability P?w,d? will be much larger \nthan P?w?P?d?, and consequently I?w,d? ? 0. If there is no \ninteresting relationship between  w and d then \nP?w,d P?w?P?d? thus  I?w,d? ? 0. If w and d are in \ncomplementary distribution, then  P?w,d? will be much less nthan P?w?P?d?forcing I?w,d? ? 0.  \nWe then defined ?????, ??? the weight of  sim?w,d?  as: \n 0          \(11 are: \n1. Calculate the sim\(w their \ncriterion function. \n3. Select the top l terms from the list. \nIII. THE CHIRSIM METHOD \nSupervised feature selection techniques such as the CHIR \nand the SIM methods are more efficient than the unsupervised nones for document clustering [17]. However, they cannot be \ndirectly applied because of the unavailability of the required \nclass information. In case to adopt the supervised feature \nselection techniques in text clustering, we first perform the K-\nmeans algorithm to get initial clusters and centroïds. We then \napply the feature selection method and perform the clustering \niteratively. In this case, good clustering results will allow \ngetting better features that will improve the clustering results \nand so on until convergence. \nA. The K-means Algorithm \nTraditionally clustering techniques are broadly divided into \nhierarchical and partition algorithms [18]; both methods were \napplied to document clustering. While hierarchical algorithms \ndivides the given dataset into smaller subsets in hierarchical \nfashion [19] [20], the partitioning algorithms attempt a flat \npartitioning of a collection of documents into a predefined \nnumber of disjoint clusters 20][21][22][23][24]. They are \nfurther categorized into probabilistic clustering, k-medoids \nmethods, and k-means methods, but the most commonly used \nis k-means algorithm. It was, on one hand, proven that k-means napproach is as good as or better than the agglomerative \nhierarchical approaches in term of accuracy and efficiency \n[20]. On the other hand, the hierarchical clustering is extremely \ncomputational expensive as the size of data increases, in \ncontrast, k-means algorithm is much faster [25]. Consequently, \nthe k-means algorithm is well-suited for document \ncategorization due to its relatively low computational \nrequirement and high quality. For these reasons we use it as the \nbasic of our clustering mechanism. \nB. The CHIRSIM Algorithm nWe first build clusters by performing the k-means \nalgorithm as initial clustering step. We then categorize the \ndocuments starting by the k clusters guided by the k-means and \nusing the CHIR-statistical measure \(a co-occurrence method the statistical clustering as input to \ncarry out the semantic clustering in which the mutual \ninformation measure SIM \(a semantic measure the current clusters and their centroids to estimate the \nrelevance of each term to the dataset. If a term is considered \nrelevant, it is kept in the feature space. Otherwise, the term \nweight is reduced by a factor f which is a predetermined factor \nin the range of [0, 1]. Then, in the new feature space and using \nthe cosine function, the documents are reassigned to the cluster \nwith the closest centroid. Detailed steps of our algorithm are \ndivided in three steps as follows: \na corpus to \nget initial clusters and centroids. \nb method by using the previous \nclustering result. The weight of each unselected \nfeature is reduced by f 0,1?. \n3. Recalculate k centroids in the new feature space. \n4.

Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 until convergence. \nc Perform the SIM similarity by using the previous \nclustering result. The weight of each unselected \nfeature is reduced by f ? ?0,1?.  \n7.

The Data Set \nThe clustering mechanism is evaluated on two different \ntypes of text datasets; a collection of articles Reuters-21578 \nand a compendium of abstracts CACM. The two corpora are \nwell known and frequently used on numerous information \nretrieval papers. We denote the sets extracted from Reuters and \nCACM by RTRS and CACM. The information about these \ndatasets is shown in Table 1. \n Before applying our clustering approach, a preprocessing \nprocess was performed. It consists of performing steps that take \nas input a plain text document and as output a set of tokens to \nbe included in the vector model. These steps typically consist 


nof: firstly, removing special characters and punctuation that are \nnot thought to hold any discriminative power under the vector \nmodel, secondly, splitting each sentence into individual words. \nThirdly, reducing the words to their basic form i.e. stem, and \nfinally, removing stop words which are terms that are not \nthought to convey any meaning.  \nB. Performance Measures \nThe effectiveness of the clustering can be evaluated by two ntypes of measures. The first one, called internal quality \nmeasure, allows the comparison of different clusters without \nusing external information. For this purpose, we use the \ncohesiveness of clusters which represents the average pairwise \nsimilarity between all documents in each cluster. \n 1|?|?  ? ????????, ?\n??\n???,????\n   \n 12 nwhere C represents the cluster, cen is the centroid of the \ncluster, d and ??are documents in the cluster. \nWe notice that the cohesiveness of a cluster is the square of \nthe cluster centroid vector length. This also includes the \nsimilarity of each document with itself, which is just one. \nWhen a feature selection method is applied to text documents, \nthe cohesiveness value of each cluster may change. A good nfeature selection method should eliminate irrelevant features, \nwhile obtaining large cohesiveness values of the clusters [5]. \nThe second type of measure, called external quality \nmeasure, allows evaluating the reliability of the clustering \nmechanism by comparing the obtained clusters to known \nclasses. We use to do this the F-measure and the purity. The F-\nmeasure is based on the fundamental informational retrieval \n nparameters, “precision” and “recall”. Precision is the ratio of \nthe relevant documents retrieved number to the total number of \nthe cluster documents. Recall is the ratio of the relevant \ndocuments retrieved number to the total number of the class \ndocuments. The formulas of the precision P and recall R for a \nclass  j and a cluster j are defined as: \n???, ??  ? ??? ???                                       \(13 14 nnumber of the documents of the cluster j and ??? is the number \nof the documents of the class i in the cluster j. \nThe F-measure of a cluster j and a class i is given by: \n 15 16 nresult is measured by the largest F-measure [26]. \n The purity of a cluster represents the ratio of the dominant \nclass in the cluster to the size of the cluster. Thus the purity of \nthe cluster j is defined as n?????????  ?  ???  ?????????                 \(17 nall purity values as given by the following formula: \n?????? ?  ? ?? ??  ?????????                \(18 better clustering result is measured by the largest purity \nvalue [27]. \nC. Results \nIn this section we compare our CHIRSIM clustering \nalgorithm with the k-means and the TCFS algorithms. Since K-\nmeans algorithm is easily influenced by the selection of initial \ncentroids, we tested the algorithm with a set of 20 random ninitial centroids from the data set. We used the averages of \nresults for the comparison. The experimental results show that \nour sequential clustering algorithm has the best clustering \naccuracy. \nSince the parameters we use can significantly affect the \nclustering mechanism, the three algorithms should be nperformed with different values of these parameters. However,  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig.3. The purity value according to the withdrawal ? for \nthe CACM dataset \n \nbecause we compare our algorithm with the TFCS clustering \nmechanism we only varied the withdrawal d from 2 to 5 and \nkeep the values of the percentage of the selected features t and \nthe factor f that reduced the term weight of irrelevant features \nas they were taken in [5]. Hence t ? 25% and ? ? 0.5. \nThe SIM feature selection method is based on the mutual \ninformation calculated on a sliding window d. It has been cited \nin [14] that 98% of the occurrences of lexical relations relate \nwords are separated by at most five words within a single \nsentence. We then execute the sequential algorithm with d?2, \n3, 4 and 5. We found as shown in Fig.1, Fig.2, and Fig.3 that \nbest results are obtained for ? ? 4. \nCategorizing unstructured textual documents containing \nbillion of terms is very complex; hence the usefulness of the \nfeature selection. However, the clustering mechanism and the \nfeature selection methods require not only the frequent and \npopular contents of the data set but also the content relationship nfactors: the semantic analysis. Our proposed system offers a \ndocument clustering with the support of statistical and semantic \nanalyses. The results show that the statistical clustering TCFS \nis optimized with our proposed semantic analysis. In fact, the \nsemantic clustering reduces the irrelevant features in a nconsiderable manner as shown by the improved cohesiveness \nvalues. The sequential algorithm with a semantic feature \nselection method can achieve a better accuracy and efficiency \nfactors than the TCFS and much better than the k-means. Table \n2 shows the cohesiveness of the first cluster, F-measure and \npurity values of the clusters obtained by running the three \nclustering when 25% of the terms were selected, the weight of 


nunselected features is reduced by 50% and the withdrawal is 4. \nThe semantic feature selection process produces more accurate \nresults. \nV. CONCLUSION \nThe volume of text data is increasing exponentially which nmakes searching for purpose difficult. In order to retrieve text \ndocuments efficiently, we developed a new clustering \ntechnique based on the combination of statistical and semantic \nclustering. The successful evaluation of our method shows that \nour approach can effectively select a set of relevant terms that ncharacterize the feature space, improve the clustering \nmechanism and optimize the statistical clustering nperformances. \nREFERENCES \n[1] M.Thangamani and P.Thangaraj, “Survey on Text Document \nClustering International Journal of Computer Science and Information \nSecurity, 2010, vol 8\(2  K.Sathiyakumari, G.Manimekalai, and V.Preamsudha, “A Survey on \nVarious Approaches in Document Clustering Int.

The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators.

Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload.

A computational tool has been developed that can\nautomatically enumerate and evaluate thousands of different\nSCaN architectures. This tool contains both a performance\nand a cost model.\nNext Steps\nThe next steps include calibration of the optical link budget\ncalculations, comparisons of the network scheduling calcula-\ntions with historical TDRSS load data, and validation of the\nspacecraft sizing algorithm with real TDRS data. Following\nthe completion of the stakeholder analysis, the tool will be\nbe used to explore the architectural tradespace and identify\na subset of preferred architectures worth studying in more\ndetail.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
