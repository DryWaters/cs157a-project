Digital Game Brand Image Information Influence to the Inexperienced Consumer s Product Evaluation   Jan Storgårds Helsinki School of Economics jan.storgards@hse.fi Virpi Kristiina Tuunainen Helsinki School of Economics virpi.tuunainen@hse.fi Anssi Öörni Helsinki School of Economics anssi.oorni@hse.fi   Abstract  It is widely held that brands positively influence the perceived quality of products. Further, brands act 
as signals of quality when attribute level data is missing. Hence, brands are often posited to enhance evaluation, particularly among the less experienced consumers. Surprisingly little evidence, however exists to support these beliefs in the context of digital games, pointing us to wonder the reasoning behind brand investments In this experimental research, the ideas from the information processing theory of consumer choice by Bettman are used to study the brand influence to consumer evaluations in the context of digital games The results of this study indicate that evaluation is not greatly biased by the brand image 
   1. Introduction  The role of the brand image is to maintain and improve the perceived quality about the product and improve consumer s level of confidence towards its salient qualities. It has been extensively recognized that brand image is an important element as a choice attribute preference for a consum Frequently, consumers can not rely on the facts and prior experience about the product while making purchase decisions. They may altogether lack first hand experience with the product class, or their product related knowledge may have become 
obsolete. Product information readily available may not disclose all the attribute information relevant to populating the consumer s preference structure. Time and budget considerations often discourage search for and retrieval of factual information. Instead, the consumer fills the voids with information drawn from secondary sources.  Brand is often held as a prime source for secondary product information. It may signal, for instance, quality of the product, biasing the decision in favor of the product with a positive brand image 
In this paper, we document the results of an experimental study in which brand image s influence to individual beliefs about product s salient attributes is tested in the context of digital games There are number of reasons why this exploration is both necessary and timely. Digital game production has grown to a significant software business Bran d in g h a s al w a y s pla y ed a significant role in selling software due to intangibility of the product. Yet, branding has visibly grown to 
even higher prominence in the game industry Actually, digital gaming is not just an industry of games, but it has already different brand extensions such as, movies, toys, and comics. Branding of games holds potential for far reaching societal effects: Digital games impact people s everyday lives by taking increasing amount of time from other activities [20, 30, 40, 43   T h ey al so h a v e b een  f o u n d  to have an increasing social effect on our daily behavi p i t e t h e  i n creas i n g su ppl y a n d 
demand for digital games, there is little research that has focused on the relationship with the brand image and consumer behavior with these products  The remainder of this paper is divided in to five sections. We will begin by introducing our theoretical background. Then, we describe the focus of this study, that is, digital games. We then introduce our research model and the salient attributes of digital games. Following that, we present our empirical study and its results. Finally, we summarize the findings and discuss future research opportunities 
 2. Theoretical background  2.1. Consumer knowledge and choice  Several researchers, such as Bettman and Park [6  s e n 24],  Ho w a rd a nd S h et h 26], F i sh bein and Ajzen a ll [2 3], an d Blackw e ll et al   a v e  tried to captu re in di vidu al s decision making behavior from the perspective of cognitive Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 
 


 information processing. Hansen [24  d e fi ne s a  cognitive information process as an intellectual sequence of thinking, evaluating, and deciding  These processes serve as tools to describe and understand the complex phenomenon of consumer choice Ajzen and Fishbein e es s e n ce o f th a t  consumer behavior as a choice between different product alternatives. They base their theories to the assumption that behavioral changes are often dominated by cognitive processes and systematic use of available information, even if people often strive to simplify their decision making w e v e r, it is  good to keep in mind that consumer decisions are context dependent and subject to, for instance influence of product type and category on evaluation  ddition a ll y  in div i du al di f f e re n c es  drive consumers to manage their deliberative processes differently, depending on many factors and situations Deci s i on m a ki ng i n v o l v e s m a ny  environmental factors that lie outside the control of the individual. Fox m a i n tai n s t h at s o cial  business, cultural and economical, factors affect the consumers stimuli and attention. When information is received in the mind, it is recorded either to the short or long term memory and processed depending on the consumer prior experiences, beliefs, attitudes goals and other evaluation criteria. This knowledge is used to choose a response suitable to the context By acknowledging these challenges and limitations, we apply the theoretical findings of Information Processing Theory of Consumer Choice  d th e m odel of  C ons um er K n o w ledg e a n d t h e  Amount of External Pre-Purchase t h e main underlying theories The central thesis of Bettman and Park th at  the choice criterion is influenced by prior knowledge and experience \(see Figure 1\They  depict that people mostly use different types of information and heuristics to compare products at different stages of their choice process e ople w i t h lit tle prior knowledge tend to simplify their product evaluation process about the products qualities and decision making due to their lack of experience. While they acknowledge the benefits of additional product information, the perceived high cost of information processing discourages search for and processing of information. In contrast, people with high levels of prior knowledge face low search costs, yet, they tend to shortcut the search process as they rely on previously acquired information. Those people with some prior knowledge have both the ability and motivation to process new information available to them Prior experience shapes the decision process through other heuristic effects, as well. For example consumers with low levels of experience tend to engage in brand comparisons, while more experienced consumers rely more on product attribute information.  The heuristic effects combined help us to explain why there is usually no linear association with the need for product information and the amount of external pre-purchase search The effects of prior knowledge on consumer decisions have also been documented in relation to technology acceptance. Prior experience influences consumers evaluation possibilities [16, 51 A  person experienced with new technologies is less likely to have problems evaluating new technology based products such as digital games    Figure 1.  Consumers Knowledge and the Amount of External Pre-Purchase Search adapted from 6, 7    2.2. Brand image and credibility  In this context, we define the brand image effect to the consumer behavior as Leon  describes it, referring closely to Keller [3 brand image are customer perceptions of and preferences for a brand, as reflected by the various types of brand associations held in customer s memory  Brand image influence consumers by creating positive or negative associations towards the produ h e y  have a perception about the brand s quality even though they would not know its detailed features  A well-known brand represents credibility and consistency to the consum Erdem an d S w ait   def i n e bran d credibility  as the believability of the product information contained in a brand, which requires that consumers pe rceive that the brand have the ability and willingness to continuously deliver Low High  Low Hi g h Level of consumer knowledge Amount of external pre-purchase search Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2

[17, 18 dep i ct th at bran d is a n  information source to the consumer and it influences perception about the brand. Brand signals the credibility of a product at different attribute levels. A credible brand decreases the perceived risk for making detrimental decisions and, thus, facilitates choice, especially for inexperienced consumers In particular, positive brand perceptions help to decrease uncertainty related to consumer held beliefs about the salient product attributes  3. Digital games  We define digital games as examples of social systems which have embedded in them information technology practice, th e y are s o f t w a re  applications the purpose of which is to entertain their users There are several different terms used for digital games, mostly depending on the device used for playing the games t com m o n a m o n g th e s e  devices are video \(e.g. Atari 2600\omputer \(PC console \(e.g. Playstation 1-3\mobile \(phone e.g. Midway\hand-held console \(e.g. Nintendo DS and electronic game \(e.g. Nintendo Game&Watch which all are regularly referred to by industry specialists as game platforms Digital games are intangible products, although they are often delivered using some sort of physical medium, like a cartridge or a DVD [34 Mo reov er  in the sphere of intangible products, digital games represent information goods f o rm a tion  g oods  have been defined as goods than can be digitized, but are not necessarily digitized, like newspapers in paper form T h ey are lik e any oth e r  information technology, which consumers need to learn and which evoke individual s behavioral feelings  There are a multitude of different types of digital games [43 W e f o cu s o n  m a s s i v el y  m u ltip la y e r  online role playing games \(MMORPG\at represent a good example of digital games, which are rich in different technical features, social interaction and relatively novel revenue models, such as, monthly paid subscription fees. MMORPG is a type of digital role-playing games in which a large number of players interact with one another in a virtual world  In these games, thousands and even millions of people gather together to accomplish tasks and quests and to socialize. MMORPGs can be described as a product that involves a high degree of product complexity, as compared to many casual games, such as, well known puzzle video game Tetris or PC based solitaire games \(the most played digital game e.g. in Finland [30    Brand images are widely utilized in the digital games industry. Digital games are commonly identified by their name \(e.g. World of Warcraft WoW, Command & Conquer 1-3, Halo 1-3 Civilization I-IV\y a well-known game characters \(e.g. Mario, Sonic, Pokemón, Max Payne A game without an identifiable name does not have a meaning to a consumer, but a well-branded game may create strong associations and greater willingness to purchase  4. Research model   The focal idea of a brand is to add value to a product  w a y of un derst a n d i n g  t h e  m e a n i n g of the brand as a value adding element is to compare the non-attribute based component such as the brand image between branded and non-branded products at the individual consumer level  As proposed regularly in the brand related literature, it is assumed that evaluations of also digital games tend to be more positive for branded games than non-branded games. A branded digital game should provide better perceived quality. Thus, there should be more positive evaluation due to the brand effects The model presented in the Figure 2 is used as a conceptual framework of this study. The objective is to test the mechanisms that relate and connect brand and beliefs by influencing consumer stimuli in an experimental research setting    Figure 2. Consumer Evaluation Model  Our research proposition is as follows: the information provided by the brand image positively influences the perceived quality in attribute level which in turn positively influences the consumer s evaluation of a digital game product  4.1.

  To investigate the effect of brand image on game evaluations, it is necessary to identify the salient attributes affecting consumer decisions through creating the beliefs about the outcomes of playing the game. Based on different sources, such as, earlier studies, game magazines reviews, internet discussion and researchers own and fellow researchers  experience, we identified sixteen different constructs in addition to price, which is looked at separately The identified constructs can be grouped into 1 game characteristics, 2\ motives to play to the game 3\ outcomes of playing, and 4\ availability usefulness and ease of use. These groups, as well as the constructs within each group, are partly overlapping, but yet, clearly identifiable as separate constructs. Particularly one construct, namely the level of enjoyment and fun, could be categorized under any or all of the proposed groups, but is here considered under the motives to play 4.1.1. Price of the game Price, brand, perceived quality, and choice are related [8, 36 ccordin g l y   one of the main objectives of a strong brand is to gain higher price price premium\mpared to nonbranded products Gam e rev e nu es are m a i n l y  gained from game sales in which game price is an important factor. However, many of the MMORPGs have a mixed revenue logic. Consumer may purchase a game disc \(DVD, Blu-Ray\ from retail shop, order the game disc by mail, download the game file over the Internet or play it with a web browser Sometimes, an additional monthly subscription fee is charged. However, many of the digital online games are available free of charge and the revenues are gained indirectly from other sources such as advertisements 4.1.2. Game characteristics  Some of the game titles are also used to produce movies and vice versa e.g. Tomb Raider, Star Wars, Indiana Jones\. Games are not narrative stories like those that can be read in the books but more similar to story telling in movies  y  g a m e s inten d to prov ide a g ood story telling in which the game player takes the role of an actor Aesthetics  visual layout graphic style and audio  are fundamental features of a digital game Originally, decades ago, digital games were textbased but as computer technology has advanced games have used the latest possibilities for creating good 2D and 3D graphics and audio effects to provide an audiovisual experien  There are companies that buy and sell intangible products such as characters, weapons, tools and gold for real money. A service in which somebody else improves your character in a desired level is called leveling These can be used in the game to advance faster and success easier in the game play. Some of the virtual world related services are based on consumer s desire to equip and develop the character by using real money Eve Online, WoW\owever using real money in MMORPGs is often considered as cheating and playing against socially constructed game rules by the most experienced game players   4.1.3. Motives to play  The level of enjoyment and fun in games can be expressed as flow experience 11 Hs u an d Lu 27] de f i n e f l o w e x perien ce of digital games as an extremely enjoyable experience where an individual engages in an on-line game activity with total involvement, enjoyment, control concentration and intrinsic interest It has been stated in several studies that entertainment oriented technology is adopted and consumed differently than work-oriented technology [16, 25, 28, 49    th at a m o n g oth e r m o ti v e s  f o r  playing online games discovery  and  extensive playing possibilities are one of the most important ones. MMORPGs should provide these product features MMORPGs provide a relatively efficient channel to communicate with people with the same interests Socializing in games can occur in a multitude of different ways. For example, people gather to play games at homes, dedicated public places and nowadays virtually connected over the Internet Grouping chatting, team work, helping others and making friends are components of enjoyment such as any other game features [12, 35  Fr i e nd s a n d  community have an important impact to the motivation to play games, possible also an influence to the digital game ch  4.1.4. Outcomes of the game  The game character and its development is one of the most important objectives in MMORPGs. According to Kujanp p r es s e s  w h at t h e g a m e  player wants to be, how the player is interconnected with the others and how game character adapts to the game environment  ex plain s adv a n c e m e n t in MMO R P Gs as  progress, power, accumulation and status. It is t he desire to gain power, progress rapidly, and accumulate in-game symbols of wealth or status Game players may use a significant amount of time \(thousands of hours\ in developing their character to accomplish quests and tasks and gaining the respect of the others. The result of considerable gaming effort is often expressed as character experience level It is considered an important component of the perceived achievement which is Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 
 


 also an important motivational factor for playing games   When gaining higher experience level and becoming "legendary via playing together with others, the player receives social status that increases the fame of the player in the community  many games, the level of character reputation is also measured. The better game character is known in the community, the more feeling of achievement the player perceives [35, 53  4.1.5. Availability, ease of use and usefulness   A product cannot be chosen if it is not available in one way or another. Srinivasan et al orizes  availability in two levels. Firstly, pull-based availability, in which company continuously intends to improve the brand awareness among the consumers. Secondly, to the push-based availability in which the company delivers the product as efficiently to the delivery channels as possible People differ from technology optimists and innovators to people feeling technology anxiety in the way they perceive different computer system  Digital games should be easily accessible, easy to learn and easy to use to reach mass markets Actually, MMORPGs are assumed to be rather easy to play and with enough time, almost anybody can reach high levels e v e r, it ca n be v e r y  difficult to master all the game details and different ways of playing Furthermore, measuring user acceptance has been found important aspect for better prediction of system design ideas that users are willing to use and find useful     5. Empirical study  The method of experimenting was selected to study the brand image effect to the consumer s beliefs and attitude In an ex peri m e n t th e  independent variables are biased by experimental stimulus which are present or absent A questionnaire, which is a part of a wider study about consumer beliefs and attitudes, was designed with two different versions. The constructs were operationalized into questionnaire items by using the ideas derived from earlier consumer behavior literature and theories [3, 4, 8  The questionnaire was evaluated and tested by the researchers and colleagues several times, and a pilot study with 30 students was conducted before the actual experiment. Three questions were modified after the pilot study, but most of the pilot study responses remained usable also in the final study Seven step scales \(1-7\with only the extremes labeled were used to measure the questionnaire items For the lack of available space, the full questionnaire is omitted from this paper, but can be acquired from the authors The questionnaire included 42 questions, with 81 items in total. Students from Helsinki School of Economics \(Helsinki, Finland\ were asked to fill in the questionnaire either in one of three class sessions or in the lobby of a university building. The respondents rated the questionnaire relatively easyto-fill with an mean rate of 5,12 in a scale 1-7 The unit of analysis is an individual which is considered as an appropriate level in consumer related quantitative research in which brand image related differences are compared [47 d en ts  f i t  well into the target group, since their high activity in participating MMORPGs, and considerably amount of time spent with these games  Two groups of subjects approximately equal in characteristics were compared. The experimental group branded filled in a form which included a game description with brand information \(World of Warcraft, probably the best known MMORPG played with more than 10 million players world-wi  including brand name and an image of the game package for creating stimulus. The control group non-branded filled in a form with the same game description but without any references to a brand Each respondent was randomly given the questionnaire form either branded or nonbranded The questionnaire form started with a description of a MMORPG played on personal computer \(PC\.  The game description was as neutral as possible referring to an imaginative game of the MMORPG genre. The game description was invented using the most common type of ideas from existing games. The game description included the sixteen selected salient attributes of a digital game, excluding price. The price was left out from the description due to our interest in understanding beliefs and attitudes towards expected quality and the game price  6. Results  The experiment was conducted between February and April in 2008. The empirical set of data was processed in several ways by using a statistical application SAS Enterprise Guide, version 4.1 Means procedure and t-tests were used to provide answers to the preliminary assumptions about the difference between the groups of respondents The data between the groups was analyzed in two ways. Firstly, the beliefs about the salient product attributes were analyzed. Secondly, the level of importance of the criteria to the respondent was rank ordered Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 
 


 There were 154 usable responses out of 157 in total \(3 uncompleted forms\ty-six percent of the respondents were female, and 44% percent were male. The respondents were between 18-54 years 24.6 years being the average and 23.5 years median Eighty-four percent of the respondents reported being from Finland and the 16% were from other countries The average age of starting playing digital games was 9,2 years In our randomly selected sample, most respondents knew what a MMORPG is, and most also recognized the name World of Warcraft \(WoW However, only 12 % of the respondents had some kind of experience of this type of games from the past three months. Furthermore, only 9 % reported having experience with WoW Many earlier studies have focused on general population or experienced digital game players which could be considered as experts [12, 13, 27, 30   According to Bettman and Park perien ced consumers do brand processing in a different way than the inexperienced consumers. By focusing on inexperienced players we can analyze the beliefs of people who are novice with these types of games and probably considered as a future target group to the game publishers. Thus, we took a subsample from the data considered as inexperienced users, who 1\ad no experience on this kind of game from at least last three months; or/and 2\ad no experience explicitly with World of Warcraft \(WoW\which was used as a reference digital game in this study \(See Table 1 for descriptive statistics on the selected subsample of respondents  Table 1. Descriptive statistics \(inexperienced  Total N Non Branded N Branded N M N Respondents 127 60 47 67 53% 0 Men / Women  69/58 127 32 / 28 53 47 37 / 30 55 45 0 Average age years\ 24.4 24.7 24 0 Median age\(years 23.0 23.0 23.0 0 Min-Max age years 19-54 19-54 19-36 0 Age when first time played digital games years, min max 9.18 5-21  9.21 5-20  9.14 5-21 7 missing values  The subsample of those inexperienced with MMORPGs in general or WoW in particular is by and large very similar to the whole sample. Only notable difference is, that the youngest subjects \(a few who were 18 years old\were those that had played MMORPGs before, and were now excluded from the final sample  6.1. Evaluation criteria  Ajzen and Fishbein gg es t t h at onl y t h e  salient beliefs should be included in the analysis of attitude formation. The number of salient beliefs is limited by the short term memory capacity. People can simultaneously handle five to nine salient beliefs towards product attributes in a choice situation However, even as few as two or three beliefs can be used. Moreover, every consumer uses a different set of beliefs for each choice situation As expected, the importance of the respondents  evaluation criteria did not differ significantly between the groups \(p < 0.0001\The combined and rank ordered importance of the evaluation criteria can be seen in the table 2  Table 2.

 followed by the availability In contrast real money usage and fame are not ranked important as the other beliefs. In contrast to the results of the study by Cole and Griffiths socializing component of MMORPG is not valued very high in this sample of relatively inexperienced users. Especially fun as a salient belief is seen important. The relatively low standard deviation of 0.96 \(SD\tandard error of 0.08 \(SE\ay indicate quite coherent opinion. All variables were below the commonly accepted statistically significant level of p < 0.05 in social sciences \(p < 0.0001    6.2. Attribute beliefs  The perceived quality in this study is based on the respondents beliefs that the digital game contains features that have been described in a game description The results of  t-test indicate that the only variable to have statistically significant difference between the groups is fun but surprisingly, in favor of nonbranded games \(see Appendix 1 for full statistical analysis details\his result was unexpected, as the brand image was predicted to create strong positive bias in comparison to non-branded games. Fun is an important factor for game selection; however, in both groups the belief of perceived fun is not highly ranked for this game. The reasons may vary, one being that the brand image enhance the perception that the game is not of a type of game that respondent s would consider in their set of product alternatives The features such as discovery and play, easy availability and graphics and audio are ranked high among the respondents. They can be depicted as relatively common features in commercially successful MMORPGs of the past few years. In contrast fame and usefulness have been remarkably low ranked features. Probably, inexperienced game players do not value being known in MMORPGs as a motive for choice. In accordance to the purpose of a digital game to entertain the user, usefulness is not considerable important in this kind of software applications   7. Summary and conclusions  The main purpose of this study was to test the influence of brand image on the perceived quality and overall evaluation in the context of digital games in an experimental research setting. The second purpose was to investigate and gather up the relevant attributes of a digital game for further, more detailed investigation One of the most important roles of marketing is to influence positively consumer beliefs and attitudes towards brands. The results did not confirm the widely accepted positive effect of brand image to the consumer beliefs towards brands. In this research study, the brand did not significantly bias respondents cognitive decision making process. This may give some indication that the positive effect of branding is ambiguous in a digital game evaluation processing In many cases, consumers may be aware of a brand as our respondents were mostly aware of WoW but they have no any information about the brand s salient attributes. It may be complicated for inexperienced consumers to create the salient criteria as an underlying base for the evaluation. The inexperienced players probably had difficulties in evaluating digital game on the attribute level Without any prior experience, it was probably especially challenging to process new information signaled by the brand image As could be expected in the case of a game, the results indicate that perceived fun is considered as one of the most important salient beliefs. Moreover brand image influenced evaluation, but in favor of the non-branded game. The brand image, an official image of game package cover, was not probably perceived as providing a lot of fun as the image expressed a rather negative and serious mood. This raises a question for marketing practioners on how the perceived fun could be achieved accurately by the information provided by the brand image In contrast, even while the practice of using real money to equip virtual goods \(such as a character ship or virtual space\ part of the company revenue model is becoming more common \(for instance, in games like EVE online and WoW, or virtual worlds such as Habbo Hotel\eems that these inexperienced respondents do not value this opportunity. One reason for MMORPGs can be that it is considered as playing against socially constructed rules of game playing. However, customer segmentation and target groups differ greatly between different digital games, like for most other the consumer goods, as well The results of this study are a preliminary attempt to understand the factors that influence the brand image of a digital product. The results may, give some indication of what kind of criteria inexperienced game players would use in selecting digital games Furthermore, the game type of MMORPG is rather specialized and complex as compared to more simple, highly popular games like solitaires and Tetris. Inexperienced game players are likely to feel Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 
 


 that MMORPG is for serious gamers only, and does not fit to their entertainment needs. Then again as Ajzen and Fishbein e positiv e or negative beliefs or attitudes towards a product do not necessarily translate into actual behavior. Many times, the decisions depend on the context of choice situation, which is difficult to predict in a general research setting We believe, that our study should be of interest to those academics who are interested in the relationship between branding and digital information goods choice. For practitioners, our study may provide new ideas on the kind of salient attributes consumers perceive important for a MMORPG, when reaching for new customer segments. Furthermore, our results encourage a careful evaluation of the brand investments. There are many factors influence consumer decision making, awareness being one of them. If the consumers do not know that the brand exists, it will not be part of the set of product alternatives, eithe  Future research is needed in order determine the relationship between the brand related information and the choice of a digital game in more detail. In the next phase of our research, we are looking into brand image effect on differences between game types, as well as experienced game players  8.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
