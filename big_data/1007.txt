of rule Presently there are many methods focus on resolving these two problems Although these methods can reduce the amount of rules derived to some extent but the total number is too big as ever In this paper we first propose the notations of upper closed itemset and generalized association rule base and obtain a generalized association rule base of a database which not only contains the whole information of all association rules but also has conform structure that is convenient for practical applications Also We propose a mining algorithm of generalized association rule base From OUT propositions and example the algorithm 
is shown valid and can efficiently solve the problem of quantity of rule Keywords data mining, upper closed itemset, generalized association rule base I Introduction Association rule mining is one of the most important research areas in data minin  to which many researchers have paid their attention 31 Yet there exist two big problems in process of acquiring rule by traditional mining algorithms i.e the quantity and the quality of rule Namely too many rules obtained and not all of those rules are interesting Presently there are many methods focus on resolving these two problems Some researchers proposed 
the methods for reducing the amount of rules by deleting or combining derived rules For instance the idea of reducing overabundant rules by sttuctured rule and summarizing related rule by clustering was proposed in 5 The method of GSE-pattern to organize generalize and represent the rule mined was presented in 13 Other researchers presented the methods of mining association rule based on constraints which can reduce amount of rules by applying some special consuaints provided by users to the mining process such as the methods in 14-191 The primary methods to improve quality of rule is to define a measure 
of interest and apply it to measure the B   lhis work was suppoad by the National Science Foundation of China NSFC under the gant No.60074014 surprisingness\(unexpectedness novelty usefulness of a pattern'*'. By the measure of interest it is possible to sort the obtained rules and provide the assured high quality rules to the policymaker such as the method proposed in 16 7 121 Moreover there are many other methods for reducing Overabundant rules and increasing the quality of the rules such as mining multiple-level association rules in 41 mining association rules with multiple minimum supports in 
20 mining passociation rule in 9-111 and the like In this paper we aim at the problem of quantity of rule Although the above methods can reduce the amount of rules derived to some extent the total number is too big as ever In th following we present a generalized association rule and its mining algorithm which can solve this problem efficiently 11 Preliminaries Definition 1 Let k{i  imJ be a set of m different items An association rule is an implication of the form XaY where Xq Yd and,XnY Definition 
2 Let X be an itemset Ifs percents of the transactions containing X in the transaction database then the supporl of X denoted as supp\(X is s Definition 3 An itemset X is closed if there exists no itemset Y so that Y is a proper superset of X and every transaction containing X also contains Y Definition 4 A closed rule is an implication expression of the form XaY where Xd Y=A and X is a 
closed itemset Definition 5 Association rule and closed rule are all called generalized association rule Definition 6 An upper closed set of an itemset X denoted asX-\(called as upper closed itemset is the smallest closed itemset containing it From Definition 6 it is obviously that the following propositions hold Proposition 1 Let X be an itemset then suPP\(x  x   Proposition 2 If X is a closed itemset then X-=X Proposition 3 The upper closed set of an itemset X is  unique 9 19 


Proof If X is a closed itemset then the conclusion holds by Proposition 2 If Xis not a closed itemset and its upper closed set is not unique then there exist two different upper closed itemsets YI Y2 of X By Definition 6 and Proposition 1 we get YtXX YQX PP\(x yl supp\(x 2 that is to say if a transaction contains X then it must contain Yl and if a transaction contains X then it must contain Y2 Therefore if a transaction contains Yl then it must contain Y2 Since Yl and Y2 are different that we have YIUY23Yl   s~PP~~l~Y2~=supP~~l By Definition 3 Yl is not a closed itemset i.e Yl is not a upper closed itemset This is a'conb-adiction with that Y is a upper closed itemset Proposition 4 Let X Y be two itemsets Then Proof By definitions of support and upper closed Proposition 5 The rule set  rlr:x 3 Y be a generalized association rule X x U Y closed itemsett not only keeps the information of all association rules but also has no redundant rule. That keeping information has two meanings I it can deduce.aU association rules of the database 2 it can keep bformation in the wurse of deducing i.e it does not change the support and confidence of rule in the deductive course That no redundant rule means no rule can be obtained by adding or deleting item of antecedent or consequent to another rule in this:%se Proof By Proposition 1-4 it is trivial Remark 1 This conclusion is of great significance in association rule hining problem. Not only does the set of rules contain all information of association rules, but also rules in it are conform i.e antecedent of le and conjunction of antecedent and consequent areboth closed itemset which make it very useful in practical application such as visualization in data mining process  Definition 7 We call the rule set  r/r x 2 Y be a generalized association rule X X U Y closed itemsett as generalized association rule base of the database Therefore all association rules of the database ch be obtained provided we can get the generalized association rule base Because the amount of closed itemsets is far Iewthan that ofitemsets'?l-2 not only can we reduce the amount of rules as many as possible but also the rules in the base will not be reduced otherwise information will be lost III Mining algorithm of generalized  association rule base I  supp\(x uY X  U Y  itemset it is,obvious    In the following we give the concrete mining algorithm of generalized association rule base Algorithm:\(Mining algorithm of generalized Input Database D the least support tninsupp and the Output Generalized association rule base Method association rule base least confidence rninconf I 1 Based on mining a1 orithm of frequent closed itemset \(e.g cIose'218 cm'23 get the frequent closed itemset FCI and number it according to cardinal number in increasing order and lexicographic order Dividing FCI into two parts FCII all itemsets with cardinal number 1 and FCI all itemsets with cardinal number greater than I 3 Recursively mining rule Call GenRule\(FC FCIz 0 Where parameters in subroutine GenRule\(F F2 RuleBaseSet are  FI-frequent closed itemset in the front part of FCI t F2-frequent closed itemset in FCI Wl  RuleBaseSet-obtained rules in generalized association rule base The concrete process as follows a If F2 then stop b Select the first element A from F2 c For all subset B of A in 4 derive the rule 2 r:BaA\\B support=supp\(B Confidencesupp\(A B If the confidence of the rule r is greater than minconf then add it in RuleBaseSet d Derive rule r:A support=supp\(A Confidence=l e Adding r in RuleBaseSet f Deleting A from Fz g Adding A in FI h Recursively call GenRule\(F Fz Prop&ition 6 From the set of all frequent closed itemset we can obtain the above generalized association rule base Proof Since all applicable combination of frequent closed itemsets can be reached by e algorithm the conclusion holds Remark 2 By.proposition 6 the above algorithm is valid Example 1 Suppose a tr&saction database is shown as Table 1 RuleBaseSet Table I Transaction Databass  b c e a b c e 920

The earlier studies which focused on the large size of retail datasets have developed several Apriorilike algorithms in order to solve the problem of discovering sequential patterns from such databases However, the Apriori-like algorithms only perform well in databases consisting of short frequent sequences [17 This is caused by the fact that it is quite time-consuming to generate nTerms sequences candidates from \(n1 disadvantage of Apriori-like algorithms [1], a variety of algorithms such as PrefixSpan [17], SPADE [25 SLPMiner [22] and GST [12] have been proposed. In order to improve the efficiency, each algorithm pursues a different method of discovering frequent sequential patterns, which makes them featured by the capability of mining such patterns without even generating any candidates With respect to the representation of the content of documents, some research works have used phrases rather than individual words [21]. However, the effectiveness of the text mining systems was not improved very much. The likely reason is that, a phrasebased method has  lower consistency of assignment and lower document frequency for terms  21]. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel concept for mining text documents for sequential patterns. Instead of using single words, we use pattern-based taxonomy to represent documents. By pruning meaningless patterns which have been proven to be the source of the  noise   in this study, the problem of  overfitting  is solved and the experimental results which show the encouraging outcomes are achieved 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recall Pr e c is

  12  Figure 32 Bottom view of dual frequency antenna tile with perforated L-band patc h in lower layer with Kuband patches  Figure 33 Layer stack with perforated L-band patch in lower layer with Ku-band patches  8  B EAM FORMING N ETWORK  A major keystone for the su ccess of phased array antenna onboard aircraft is the capability of steering the main beam in the direction of the geosta tionary satellites. This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
