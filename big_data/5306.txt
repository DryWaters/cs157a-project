The data that the Internet of Things\(IOT produced is fuzzy and enormous and the Complex Events 
Processing\(CEP which is the key part of the Internet of Things need to meet the big dataês quantity and complexity In CEP how to describe the context and infer from the context is the most important and in this paper a fuzzy D-S theory and fuzzy ontology based context model is proposed according to the model we design a similarity based context reasoning method The experimental resul ts show that this method can support fuzzy context in CEP and have better performance and accuracy than other methods

I I NTRODUCTION 
As the RFID and sensor network technical developed quickly the apply range of the Internet of Things become more and more extensive Among this how to process the information especially different kinds of data is the key problem The complex events processing of Internet Of Things  demand complete devices could recognize the current context information and its transformation of users and make the response to this Among this procedure the collecting and processing of the context information play the important role Since the description of the context information model exists heterogeneity however the machine may has a different understanding for the same 
context so it is very hard to achieve the knowledge's sharing and reusing and makes the knowledge based reasoning much complicated on the other hand as the limitation of hardware device and network transmission problem the information that collected may be incomplete and high-level context information which deduced from the uncertain perception data als o exists uncertainty Hence how to describe the context information formalized and able to use the uncertainty to execute knowledge reasoning judgment and decision making has become particularly important A well accepted definition of context is proposed by Dey   
 
a Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity An entity is a person place or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application including the user and application themselves And the ontology modeling has a higher formalization level and a good inference capability its representation of the complex and dependency relationship between context data make it well accepted solution by many researchers But its biggest weakness is that the representation and processing of the fuzzy and uncertainty context problem  
 Therefore in this article a fuzzy D-S theory based fuzzy ontology context modeling approach is proposed correspondingly the fuzzy D-S theory is also presented to deal with th e uncertainty fuzzy context reasoning problem In this paper we describe a fuzzy D-S Theory and fuzzy ontology based context modeling and an algorithm used for similarity based context reasoning The structure of this paper is as follows the context modeling and similarity based reasoning will be introduced in the next section and in section III we introduction some concepts about context modeling and discuss the fuzzy D-S theory and fuzzy 
ontology based context modeling In section IV we discuss the algorithm of the similarity based context reasoning In section V some simulation is presented And we make a conclusion about this paper in section VI II R ELATED W ORK The common used context modeling approach concludes 1 Key-Value model which is easy to manipulate but it is not convenient for complicated structure and does not permit a good reasoning on context Many of the early researches used this approach such as Schilit et.al  used a Key-Value model to represent the location context 2 Markup models are most of the time specific to a particular field 
and are limited to some aspects of context The representative method of this model is CC/PP  whichis though too simple but supplied a basis for other models to extend Comparing to the key-value model markup model already has a better structure and can describe complex data structures 3 Graphical models are simple but less formal than the other models 4 Object oriented models require low level execution agreemen ts between applications to ensure interoperability For example Bouzy  used the OO

model to deal with the computer go related context information the GUIDE project  used Active object model to encapsulate and process context 5 Logic based model try to represent the context using fact expression and rule In 1993 McCarthy et.al  had a lready r es earched and published the earliest logic based context model Formalizing Context 6 Ontology based model is good at representing the relationship between the computing concepts and many papers are all based this method As to the similarity based context reasoning Chun et.al 9 p r e sen t ed a s im ilar ity b a sed D istr ib u t ed Co n t ex t Reasoning with layer context model this method enhance the trust of reasoning outcomes than the earlier approach The reference prop os ed a s i m i l a ri t y bas e d reas oni ng method with the D-S theory applied in the paper the new context merge with the most similar context and have no influence with other branches III C ONTEXT M ODELING Generally An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization It means that ontology is an explicit shared and formal descriptio n of important concepts and their relationships Ontology based context model has strong expression ability and can deduce the high level context information Moreover it is also easy for the knowledge sharing and reusing and there are many mature ontology base that can be reused With help of ontology user and system can communicate with each other But the ontology based context model cannot handle the fuzzy context information and their uncerta inty reasoning For example the context information could be very fast and very slow So we propose to use the fuzzy ontology to address this issue Several fuzzy ontology descriptions have been proposed 11  its basic definition is described as follows Definition 1 Fuzzy Ontology a fuzzy ontology of domain D is a quintuple defined as O\(D I C T N X>,for details I is the individual set which includes all the instances C is the concepts set which includes all the concepts of the domain D,T is the fuzzy taxonomic relationship N is fuzzy non-taxonomic relationship and X is axioms that expressed in a logical language Definition 2 Extended Fuzzy Ontology an extended fuzzy ontology means extending the Entity E fuzzy taxonomic relation T fuzzy non-taxonomic relationship N as V M where V and M is the corresponding linguistic variable set and membership function Fox example Speed  Slow Medium Quick S M Q and S M Q are depicted in Eq 1 Unfortunately currently there are no corresponding fuzzy ontology standards from w3c yet So we just build our fuzzy context ontology FOCM using the extension of OWL2 12  In this paper as we can see from the figure 1,it is a fragment of the fuzzy ontology context model the main entity are Person and Comp Entity the real line arrow is means has a relationship and the triangular arrow means is a relationship for example the Driver is a subclass of Person the Car is a subclass of Device the Driver has a relationship with the Car in other words Driver could drive the Car this relationship is a fuzzy relationship because we donêt know where or how fast does the drivers the car Also the Car has a speed property and at most time we say the driver drives the car with a s low or medium or quick speed it is a fuzzy concepts so we can describe it use the extended fuzzy ontology like the Definition 2 depicts Figure 1 FOCM Fragment Based the basic fuzzy ontology model in this paper we add three necessary external classes the three classes and its relations are as the figure 2 shows Figure 2 Basic added classes and its relations Like the figure 2 shows we can know the three added classes Conclusion Evidence BPA that represents the high

Figure 4 indic a cases, the majority of the directories have n top 5 tag selection \(88.8%\ and no relation 93.8%\  This means that we selecte d directories which have highest scores in b o features. In this set, there are 415 directori e has the exact set of top 5 tags and strong s with at least one other directory.

The exercise of reviewing three sets of clusters took a total of ~8 hours. Not only did this ìdistantî method speed up the process of reviewing and tidying the archive in comparison to reviewing the collection item by item, it also provided significant insight into the formation process and embedded meaning in the collection.

On one hand, this is necessary due to a lack of prior knowledge or prior models applicable to this problem. On the other hand, the heuristic knowledge, such as series distribution and customized tags lists, simplify the computations and the complexity of the processing workflow. Still, we think that using ER as a framework for data curation processes is a viable approach that can be generalized to other collections with additional learning methods to improve its robustness and effectiveness There is an important part missing from the work presented here, namely the scope of the results in relation to the entire collection. Understanding how complete is the representation provided by the distant processing is not yet possible because there is no suitable benchmark set Creating such a benchmark is not trivial, but is something we will strive for in future work In the future, we want to investigate what kind of results might be produced by further modifying the algorithm as a consequence of observations during the first clustering iteration evaluation and of the emergence of new requirements as the data are cleaned, reorganized, and filtered. We also plan to visualize the cluster review process including other metadata such as identical checksums, and file format identification that can help the curator validate his cluster evaluation and improve action decision making A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  Funding for this work was provided by grants from the National Archives and Records Administration and the Packard Humanities Institute R EFERENCES  1  R  S e rlen  Th e Di s t ant F u tu re?
