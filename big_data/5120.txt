Abstract 
 Context-aware computing is a new paradigm that relies on large amounts of data collected from a variety of sources ranging from smartphones to sensors to automatically take smart decisions This usually leads to large volumes of data that need to be further processed to derive higher-level context information Clouds have recently emerged as interesting candidates to 
support the storage and aggregation of such data for largescale context-aware applications However speciìc extensions to support context-aware data need to be designed in order to be able to fully exploit the clouds potential In this paper we introduce such a cloud-based system designed to support real-time processing and persistent storage of context data Context Aware Framework is designed as an extension of the BlobSeer storage system building a context-aware layer on top of it to enable scalable high-throughput under high-concurrency 
for big context data Our experimental evaluation validates the transparency mobility and real-time guarantees provided by our approach to context-aware applications

in fact already used to optimize e.g by helping organizing tasks contacts etc and assist e.g with navigation nd information more quickly access online data etc users with their everyday activities Their success is the basis for a shift towards developing mobile applications that are capable to recognize and pro-actively react to userês own environment Such context-aware mobile applications can help people better interact between themselves and with their surrounding environments This is the basis for a paradigm where the 
context is actively used by applications designed to take smarter and automated decisions mute the phone when the user is in a meeting show relevant information for the userês current location assist the user nd its way around a city or automatically recommend events based on the userês possibly learned proìle and interests To support this we designed Context Aware Framework  a middleware to automate the provisioning of context data to mobile applications It sits between a persistence layer where 
data is actually stored in a Cloud storage system and the actual context-aware application running on the userês mobile devices masking the complexity of managing the data In our vision a truly context-aware system is one that actively and autonomously adapts and provides the appropriate services or content to the users using the advantages of contextual information without too much user interaction Thus providing efìcient mechanisms for provisioning contextsensitive data to users is an important challenge for these systems Context Aware Framework is designed to support the 
storage of context data for such context-aware systems It manages every problem related to for example the unpredictable wireless network connectivity and data privacy concerns over the network providing transparent access to the data to such systems The contribution of this paper is twofold we rst introduce the Context Aware Framework middleware together with

the design requirements that motivated our choices we then present experimental results supporting our decisions and illustrating the performance obtained when using Context Aware Framework  The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II makes an analysis of the main requirements for contextaware storage systems and presents the architecture of the Context Aware Framework that we devised following this analysis Section III presents details of the implementation while Section IV presents evaluation scenarios and results illustrating the overall obtained system performance Section V presents an overview of the main relevant work in the eld We conclude with Section VI  II A RCHITECTURE In a typical context-aware application users rely on their mobile devices to receive information depending on their current environment Such applications can help users augment their reality they could receive information about neighbouring places or buildings in a typical tourism application they could receive recommendations or navigation data that could help a driver to more easily navigate around a city In such scenarios users are generally  and typical context data includes elements such as locality time userês status etc is important for provisioning the amount of data is potentially too large to be served entirely on the userês mobile device thus a selection of only the most relevant context data from the immediate surrounding environment is preferred Therefore our Context Aware Framework should be able to support  Except for mobility context-aware applications should provide for data provisioning The user should not receive events that happened too far in the past as such events might not even be valid for his/her current interests For example if a tourist is looking for information about objectives near him/her he/she might not be so happy receiving recommendations for a trip taken some while back The same might happen when users expect alerts about potential congestions in trafìc if he/she receives such alerts when is already in the congested road the information is not so valuable anymore To cope with such a requirement Context Aware Framework should support between users We also acknowledge the imperfections of todayês wireless communication infrastructures Context Aware Framework will not assume user is always connected to the Internet a wireless connection might not be available or in roaming the connection might not come cheap It will  and in this case we look at alternatives such as opportunistically using the data accessed by others from distributed caches using only short-range communication in form of Bluetooth and/or WiFi The system should allow in terms of speed of access as well as support for complex queries Applications should be able to express their interests using complex queries in forms of naturally-expressed lters For example the application will be able to request the data using an expression similar to get prediction of my friends location but only for those in town Or an aggregated request could be expressed as get prediction of road trafìc on a particular street For context-aware applications we consider that the system should support e.g sensors and external services such as a weather service access to data using different granularities and the aggregation of information The framework needs to support  For a typical collaborative trafìc application the number of users could potentially be in the range of millions The data should be  the history of data should be preserved for traceability and advanced data mining processing Except for these theoretical requirements we also analyzed the functional demands coming from a context-aware application For this we analyzed CAPIM a platform designed to support context-aware services Such services are designed to help people in an university who may be endowed with a portable device on top of which they run an application which facilitates the access to information by automatically reacting to changes of context CAPIM brings support by a providing different information contents based on the different interests/proìles of the visitor student or professor having scientiìc interests in automatic systems or computer science etc and on the room he/she is currently in b learning from the previous choices formed by the visitor what information

As explained the is responsible for handling the logical relation between the description of the context data and its actual physical storage To illustrate this we assume the following example in a large city many users might send GPS data to collaboratively support an application capable to aggregate this information and offer a trafìc model Some users are capable to also send data about pollution they have sensors for monitoring the air quality We assume this information is sent and stored using the previously described Context Aware Framework  First the will write in the the datatypes used by the application Next different will write the actual context data which is similar to The data is written in a Blob inside the the actual data is stored in  In this example the data is written in bursts We support this feature in cases for example when a car can collect data and sent it only when a WiFi connection becomes available The actual information used to describe the physical storage looks similar to  where refers to the application id that generated the data   and identify the blob its version the data offset and size in the Blob where the information was written Next the adds an entry linking the to the e.g The actual implementation of the uses Mongodb a e xible open source document-oriented NoSQL database system Mongodb includes support for master-slave replication and load balancing For searching it also supports regex queries For Context Aware Framework  the database system was preferred for several reasons The number of entries kept by the entries previously described is small Each entry follows a structured object-oriented data schema Consequently an object-oriented database model is preferred Also when the number of metadata access requests becomes high enough the system should be able to scale MongoDB the distributed object relational database is the natural choice because it support distributed deployment and high scalability The Metadata Manager is also collaboratively used by different applications For security and management reasons in the actual implementation each application stores its related data in separate sandboxes As previously described for accessing the data the builds a search lter This can include different custom data types deìned by an application The lter speciìes the restrictions for searching particular datatypes For instance a lter can include restrictions for retrieving speciìc location and pollution levels In this example the lter looks similar to

system has to aggregate data from two different data types Again we varied the number of clients assumed in the experiment up to 112 The experiment ran until Context Aware Framework has all the context data persistently written When all data is written next all clients issue a lter such that all queries will always return results In a rst experiment we used the same lter but the caches will return always the value and the time penalty is minimal We next assumed that each client issues a unique lter thus each query is served by questioning the last layer  We were interested to see the Brokerês capability to support parallel client requests Figures 4 and 5 show the results obtained in this case Figure 4 Simple Search Figure 5 Complex Search Again in this case Context Aware Framework is able to successfully handle the queries coming from distinct clients The results show that time increases by small amounts thus the system shows again good scalability results V R ELATED W ORK The ubiquity of mobile devices and sensor pervasiveness e.g as in smart city initiatives call for scalable computing platforms to store and process the vast amounts of the generated streamed data Cloud computing provides some of the features needed for these massive data streaming applications However todays cloud computing platforms lack very important features that are necessary in order to support the massive amounts of data streams envisioned by the massive and ubiquitous dissemination of sensors and mobile devices of all sorts in smart-city-scale applications For massive context data streaming applications M3 is a prototype data streaming system that is being realized at Purdue using Hadoop M3 eliminates all of Hadoopês disk layers including the distributed le system HDFS and the disk-based communication layer between the mappers and the reducers It proposes a hybrid memory-based and disk-based processing layer includes dynamic rate-based load-balancing and multi-stream partitioning algorithms and fault-tolerance techniques However M3 can handle only streaming data and does not handle queries that mix streaming with disk-based data A context awareness extensible layer for M3 has been demonstrated separately in Chameleon Ho we v er  Chameleon lacks general conte xtbased indexing techniques for realizing context awareness thus when the context changes the system cannot easily augment the query being executed by additional predicates to reîect that change Similar to Context Aware Framework  the author of present a large scale system called Federated Brokers for context-aware applications In order to avoid the centralized design\(single point of failure found in previous papers the authors propose a context-aware platform that includes multiple brokers The main difference compared to our system is that our architecture implies the existence of a metadata manager for all stored information which relieves much of the burden impose for managing data on the mobile application and that we offer prediction capabilities based on the provisioned data Also notable is that the evaluation of Federated Brokers was conducted over a small-size homogeneous environment We actually tested Context Aware Framework over a large grid environment with more brokers and clients considering a large distributed storage conìguration From an utility point of view our platform can also be compared with Google Now and Microsoft On X  Google Now is able to predict what information an user need based on his previous searches and on his context data Microsoft On X lets the user set actions for states deìned by his context data When a certain state previous deìned by the

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
