I I NTRODUCTION With the development and wide deployment of web services mobile applications and sensor networks data are now collected from many distributed sources to form big datasets For example users of mobile devices can generate many useful information such as user-user interactions users interests on products users location information 
users tweets etc Such datasets have become a valuable asset to the data owner This paradigm raises a number of challenges for data storage sharing and analysis 
Most data collectors such as mobile devices and sensors have very limited resources to store and process data Thus the data have to be sent to servers or clouds The collected data may be highly sensitive So it becomes necessary to transfer store and process them securely Data miners might be authorized by the data owner to use the data Processing and analyzing the secured big data will require a huge amount of computing resources to be allocated on demand where cloud computing is 
   
the ideal platform With these problems in mind we envision a cloud-based data storage and processing framework that enables users to economically and securely share and handle big matrices collected from distributed sources In this framework the data contributors may submit data vectors e.g a vector describing the users interactions in a social network service or a vector describing the users interested topics to the cloud via a mobile app provided by the service provider i.e the data owner The dat a owner authorizes the data consumers i.e a data mining team of the social service provider to conduct analysis With this framework both the data owner and data consumers do not need to own in 
house computational infrastructures they need only a PC to interact with the cloud infrastructure to 036nish the data intensive computing The key problem of this framework is the security of data The data owner loses the control of the data once the data are exported to the cloud For many reasons such as a compromised cloud infrastructure or insider attacks conducted by the cloud provider’s employees the cloud provider may not be considered a trusted party Storing data securely is trivial but processing data securely in the cloud is very challenging because th e underlying infrastructure is owned by the untrusted cloud provider Our framework aims to enable the trusted par 
ties to collaboratively securely conduct computation on encrypted data on top of untrusted cloud infrastructures The most relevant approach is fully homomorphic encryption 7   12  whi c h ho we v e r  i s t o o e xpens i v e t o b e practical As cloud users expect to minimize the client-side costs in general approaches which demand high costs on communication and the client side processing do not 036t the cloud-based framework Section V for more details

When the matrix is large the iterative methods i.e poweriteration based methods 1 4  are u s e d t o 036 nd t h e a pproximate top-k eigenvectors instead The most expensive step of the iterative methods is the m atrix-vector multiplication In the proposed framework we use the Paillier encryption system 14 t o e n c ry p t th e v alu e s which enables the processing of encrypted data in the cloud The data owner manages the keys and owns the data in the cloud At the data owner’s request the data collectors encrypt vectors e.g describing the interactions in social network or preferences over books and submit them to the cloud to form the big matrix The data owner or the authorized data consumer who has only limited computing resources then interacts with the cloud to conduct an iterative computation to 036nd the approximate top-k eigenvectors The core component of this framework is the secure matrix-vector multiplication between the encrypted matrix stored in the cloud and the vector provided by the client Paillier encryption is used to enable computations over encrypted data in the cloud which is much more ef\036cient than the existing fully homomorphic encryption methods 7 Ho we v e r  i t can onl y p ro vi de homomorphi c a ddi t i on handicapped for homomorphic matrix computation We develop an ef\036cient perturbati on-based protocol to overcome this problem and ensure no information is leaked in the computation It also guarantees low costs in the trusted client side the data owner data collectors and the authorized data consumers to fully take advantage of cloud computing We also develop a MapReduce program to process the secure matrix-vector multiplication to fully exploit the parallelism and scalability enabled by the cloud platform An extensive evaluation has been conducted on the proposed method The result shows that the cloud-side parallel processing on encrypted data is ef\036cient and scalable and the client-side costs are quite acceptable The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows Section II gives background knowledge about the proposed approach including a brief description on the Paillier encryption system the power iteration methods and the MapReduce programming model Section III describes the design of the approach an d also analyzes its correctness security and costs Section IV presents the results of experimental evaluation with a focus on the storage and computing costs in both the cloud and client sides Section V shows some related work on secure computation in the cloud II P RELIMINARIES In the following we will brie\037y describe our notation and background knowledge about eigenvalue decomposition Paillier encryption and MapReduce programming For clear presentation we will use Greek characters to represent scalars lower case letters for vectors indexed lower case letters for the elements in the vector and capital letters for matrices or submatrices In particular represents the group of dimensional vectors of integers with moduluo Weuse to denote a set of vectors or values Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix has many important applications in science and engineering domains In particular eigenvalue decomposition has been an important tool in data analysis For example Principal Component Analysis PCA depends on eigenvalue decomposition 8  In information retrieval it is used to 036nd the relationship between words and documents on a text corpus 5 The matrices from these applications can be very large Thus the direct computation method that costs is not a viable option Instead for large matrices power iteration based methods such as the Arnoldi 1 a nd Lanczos met hods 4 are u s e d for 036 ndi ng t h e t op-k e i g en v ect ors  In pract i ce such matrices are often sparse However in this paper we focus on dense matrices the result on which will be extended to sparse matrices Assume  isa real matrix and is a random dimensional vector We sketch these power iteration methods in Algorithm 1 Framework of Power Iteration Methods 1 random D vector 2 i 1to  4 other operations of cost speci\036c to the Arnoldi or Lanczos methods 5 to generate eigenvectors Note that in this iterative framework the most expensive operation is the line  Other operations are only related to processing and some auxiliary matrix Usually only a few eigenvectors are needed and thus is typically small e.g k=10 The remaining computations speci\036c to the Arnoldi and Lanczos methods cost only  With the matrix stored in the cloud we can let the cloud take care of the most expensive part while the client handles the remaining low-cost steps Fully homomorphic encryption aims to allow addition and multiplication to be conducted on encrypted values without decr yption Paillier Encryption is a partially homomorphic encryption scheme that is much more ef\036cient than the fully homomorphic ones 7  b ut onl y preserves homomorphic addition i.e 1 Multiplication cannot be implemented on top of and in Paillier encryption However with one operand not encrypted say  multiplication can still be implemented as mod power 2

where means the modulo power operation  For simplicity of presentation we use to represent mod power  It has been proven that Paillier Encryption has strong security guarantee satisfying the de\036nition of semantic security Therefore to implement more complicated operations with Paillier encryption one has to expose one of the operands which becomes the security hole Finding a way to limit the exposure and maintain data privacy will be one of the challenging tasks in the application III S ECURE T OP K E IGENVECTOR C OMPUTATION IN THE C LOUD In this section we will describe the major components in our approach We begin with the general computational framework and describe the roles of the client and cloud components Next we present the security/threat model and discuss our assumptions and potential attack points We follow with the secure power iteration algorithm that is built up with Paillier encryption and random perturbation Then we brie\037y discuss the cloud-side MapReduce algorithm Finally we formally analyze the security and cost of the proposed approach We show that our approach can minimize the cost of the client-side computation while providing excellent performance for processing big matrices with strong security guarantee Our framework involves four parties cloud data owner data collectors and authori zed data users It re\037ects the highly distributed nature in data intensive computing where collecting data storing data and processing data might be handled by different distributed parties Figure 1 illustrates the relationship and interaction between these parties The non-cloud parties the data owner the data collectors/contributors and the authorized users are trusted The data owner controls all rights to the data distributes public keys and asks the data collectors/contributors to upload the collected data which are encrypted by a public key The data owner can process the pooled data by him/herself or authorize other users to use the encrypted data Each data collector may contribute a small part of the data e.g a row of the matrix Practical examples may include the interactions with other users or the recommendations on items during a period The data owner or the authorized users can interact with the cloud to conduct matrix analysis tasks Note that encrypted data will have a size much larger than the original one The authorized users cannot afford to download the encrypted big matrix and conduct computations locally Instead they want to fully utilize the bene\036ts of cloud computing and minimize the client-side cost Our security analysis is built on the important features of the discussed architecture Under this setting we believe the following assumptions are appropriate  The cloud provider is not trustable and may silently observe the data and the computation to 036nd useful information e.g the eigenvectors  Only the data owner and the authorized users can use the proprietary matrix The data owner authorizes some trusted users to use the data They will not intentionally breach the con\036dentiality We consider insider attacks to be orthogonal to our research  The client-side system and the communication channels are properly secured and no part of the con\036dential matrix or the computation results can be leaked  Adversaries can see the secured matrix and the submitted plaintext vectors for secure matrix-vector computation but nothing else These assumptions can be maintained and reinforced by applying appropriate security policies Protected Assets Data con\036dentiality is the central issue in our approach While the integrity of data and computation is also an important issue it is orthogonal to our study Due to the space limitation we will not cover data and computation integrity techniques 18 whi c h a re t ypi cal l y used to prevent adversaries from actively tampering with the data or computation Therefore we can assume the honest but curious adversary model Attacker’s goal The attacker is interested in recovering or estimating the matrix elements and the computing result i.e the eigenvectors and eigenvalues Security De\036nition The protected matrix is indistinguishable to chosen-plaintext attack IND-CPA The submitted plaintext vectors in the computation are no different from random samples uniformly drawn from a suf\036ciently large vector space with elements in the set if is the number of bits for encoding The protocol will not

In each iteration of the proposed algorithm the client side will receive the encrypted vector from the cloud decrypt it regenerate a plaintext perturbed vector and submit it for the next iteration We will evaluate the communication memory and computation costs of the corresponding steps The communication costs consist of receiving the encrypted vector from the cloud and sending the plaintext perturbed vector back to the cloud We use the number of bytes to represent these costs According to the previous discussion an encrypted vector of 10,000 dimensions will cost 2.56M bytes which needs to be transmitted to the client side In comparison the returned plain vector of 10,000 long integers has 80K bytes These sizes are also linearly proportional to the number of dimensions The computational steps include decrypting the vector and constructing the new plaintext vector Let the perturbation pool contain 10 randomly generated vectors Table II shows the cost distribution with different dimensions As observed decryption takes most of the time Since decryption can be easily done in parallel with a multicore processor this cost can be further reduced Dimension will be added to the perturbation pool However since the number of iterations is normally small the pool requires only a limited amount of memory For example with 10,000 dimensions and a pool size of 10 10 iterations need only about 2M bytes of memory to hold the plain long integer vectors The cloud side has major costs in storing the encrypted data and computing the secure matrix-vector multiplication Note that encrypted data has signi\036cantly larger size It is impractical for an authorized user to download and process the data locally We show some real numbers in Table III to give a more concrete idea of the problem scale Matrix dimension Unencrypted GB Encrypted GB 10000 0.8 25.8 30000 7.2 232.0 50000 20.0 645.0 Table III S TORAGE COST FOR MATRICES ENCRYPTED WITH A 1024BIT KEY  Clearly data in such scales cannot be processed using traditional methods Instead we have to fully exploit the parallel processing power in the cloud The cloud side computation consists of the secure matrix-vector multiplication The matrix is stored in the form of row vector sets and split into data blocks of 64MB in the Hadoop 036le system The MapReduce framework assigns each block to a Map This allows sets of vector-vector dot products to occur in parallel Because the expensive operations happen in the Map phase the number of Maps determines the overall performance

   9 extreme radiation environment could induce faults i n these components that can only be cleared by the removal and reapplication of power termed off-pulsing The FM S implements an off-pulsing architecture that provide s offpulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transce iver IEM and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earth’s orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraft’s orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the mission’s product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earth’s rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
