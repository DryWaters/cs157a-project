In our study we developed a software tool of Multilayer Perceptrons ANN analysis Back Propagation and Scale Gradient Conjugate training algorithms that automatically tests different configurations for the ANNs on the diagnosis of Alzheimer\325s dis ease Analysis was performed primarily on all 159 variables biometrics and IMU records of 21 AD patients and 21 healthy subjects exposed to seven different tasks with increasing postural stress and posteriorly on selected data derived from Mann  Whitney analysis Multilayer Perceptron ANN reached a performance of 95 on the diagnosis of AD proving to be a potential useful clinical tool  Keywords 321  Alzheimer's disease Artificial Neural Network Inertia Measurement Units; Postural Stability     I NTRODUCTION  I  Around 30 of people aged older than 65 living in the community and more than 50 of those living in residential care facilities or nursing homes fall every year and about half of those who fall do so repeatedly 1 With the increase of the elderly population the number of falls in this group has also been increasing 2  Postural instability characterized by excessive and uncontrolled sway, degrades with ageing  and  is a factor for occurrence of falls especially in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease \(AD 3  AD is a neurodegenerative cortical disorder that besides memory deficits also displays posture and gait disturbances that trig ger more serious falls compared to non demented elderly people Thus it is highly commendable the development of diagnostic approaches that may help early noninvasive detection of AD pathology S tudies on p ostural kinetics and stability open  a possibility  because  as shown recently in 4  AD patients display a different kinetic profile  Most of postural kinetics studies on AD are based on postural analysis of center of pressure on force plates In contrast Inertial Measurement Units IMU with integrated accelerometers and gyroscopes are small fully portable devices, that are independent of inclination in space and have proved to be equivalent to force platforms in the measurement of center of mass \(COM\ and stability analysis 5 Also IMU have the advantage of measuring postural stability in several stability and environment scenarios including inclined surfaces  However because s everal factors  can act simultaneously with complex and nonlinear interactions in the same patient  it is necessary  to collect a large amount of data  Artificial neural networks ANN s  are statistical machine learning models, inspired by the highly interactive proce ssing functions of the human brain  that when exposed to complex data sets can recognize patterns learn the relationship of different variables and address classification tasks  in a way that  can generalize its mapping to new data 6 Several works have applied  ANN s on the diagnosis  of AD combining different variables such as demographic neurological  and  psychiatric clinical evaluation  neuropsy chological tests and more complex clinical diag n ostic tools  eg  neuropathology e lectroencephalography  EEG  and brain imaging   where hundreds of variables of  recorded data are  potentially clinical l y relevant  on one single patient  Mecocci  et al 7 o n a pharmacological clinical trial  on 61 AD patients with the objective of d iscriminating  responders versus non responders to a 3 month treatment with donepezil  with the outcome of cl inician\325s impression  and neuropsychological  tests scores  observed that ANNs were more effective total accuracy in predicting the outcome of 92.59  in comparison to linear discriminant analysis  Buscema  et al 8 showed that ANN model s are  better predictors than Linear Discriminant Analysis i n a longitudinal  study of AD patients where demographic data and the cognitive and functional variables of each subject during the last year of her/his  life was correlated with postmortem brain 978-1-4799-2921-4/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE

intelligent choice of the number of h idden units depends on whether you are using  early stopping  or some other form of  regularization  If not we must simply try many networks with different numbers of hidden units  estimate the generalization error  for each one, and choose the network with t he minimum estimated generalization error   31   We have developed a software tool that does this automatically In our study  choosing the network with minimum estimated generalization error  we found no significant differences between BP and SCG training algorithms which regards to  performance or the number of neurons in first and second hidden layer  Currently t he diagnosis of  AD is based on clinical a nd cerebral imaging  criteria   10   Our work  shows that postural kinematic analysis has the potential  to be used as a future comple m en tary diagnostic tool   Besid es MPL ANN  other data mining techniques  ha ve also proven to be usefull on diagnosis of AD based on other type of clinical data Radial basis function neural networks has been used on visual graph analysis of EEG  32   and Support Vector Machine s on MRI data  33   Future perspectives of our work are  to  compare MPL ANN with other data mining methods and to  collect a larger data set of AD  patients and healthy subjects   References  1  Kannus P Sievanen H Palvanen M Jarvinen T Parkkari J Prevention of falls and consequent  injuries in elderly people Lancet 2005;366\(9500\:1885 93.
