 Study on Association Rules Mining Based Chinese Text Representation     Fang Li, Qunxiong Zhu School of Computer Science and technology Beijing University of Chemic al Technology, Beijing, China lifang@mail.buct.edu.cn        Financial supports from National Natural Science Foundation of China \(No: 60774079\ and National High Technology Research and Development Program of China \(863 Program\ \(No: 2006AA04Z184\ are highly appreciated Abstract  In this paper, the problem of text representation in the process of text mining is mainly discussed. The paper focuses on how to simplify the text model in advance of the construction of term-by-document matrix. By using association rules mining method to find the highly correlative words to form words-set, the vocabulary set is decreased effectively, which leads to the text model’s simplification directly. During this process, some incremental update problems of text representation are also introduced. In the end, a simulation case validate that the method is not only efficient but also helpful to the further text clustering  1. Introduction  For mining large document collections, it is necessary to pre-process the text documents and store the information in a data structure, which, also known as text representation or text modeling is more appropriate for further processing than a plain text file Vector Space Model \(VSM\ currently the predominant approach and more effective in text structuring. But very often VSM of document text data lead to high dimensional matrix representation. Lowrank factorization methods, such as principal component analysis \(PCA\ and non-negative matrix factorization \(NMF\ood choices to enable user to work with reduced dimensional models, and also facilitate more efficient statistical classification clustering and organization of data. But all these methods ignore the semantic relationship between different words, which is more important in dealing with text data. So it will be a good idea to focus on the method considering the semantic information adequately with dimension reduction Association rules mining [1 d o it. I n t h is p a p e r we use association rules mining method to mine the words-set, which is comprised of highly correlative words. Then, using words-sets to substitute the correlative words, we can get a lower dimensional data set, based on which we can construct a simple VSM We simplify the problem at the phrase of text presentation. Of course, this method can’t substitute further dimension reduction, but it does simplify the model to a certain extent  2. Association rules mining  The general association rules are regularly evaluated by support and confidence.The following is a formal statement of association rules e t I  i1,i2,…im} be a set of items. Let D be a set of transactions, where each transaction T represent a set of items such that T 002 I.  Associated with each transaction is a unique identifier, called its TID. A transaction T contains X, a set of items in I, if X 002 T An association rule is a meaning of the form “X 000 Y where X, Y 002 I, and X 003 Y 004 The rule X 000 Y has a support s in the transaction set D means s% of the transactions in the D contain X 005 Y. In other words, the support of the rule stands for the probability that X and Y are concurrent among all the possible presented cases. The rule X 000 Y hold in the transaction set D with confidence c if c% of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y Given a set of transactions D, the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have support and confidence greater that the user-specified minimum support \(called minsup \d minimum confidence \(called minconf\pectively Association rules mining is normally a two-step process, where in the first step frequent item-sets are discovered and in the second step association rules are derived from the frequent item-sets. Here, the first step is more important, on which plenty of researches are

 focused. The most popular algorithms are Apriori d F p G ro w t h  3  3. Text representation  3.1. Text preprocessing  Text representation is the basic step of text mining by which, a text document is represented by a set of words, i.e. a text document is described based on the set of words contained in it \(bag-of-words representation\. In order to be able to define at least the importance of a word within a given document, usually a vector representation is used, where for each word a numerical ”importance” value is stored Chinese text representation is different from English, because in case of Chinese document text there is no obvious space between Chinese words. So the first step needs word-segmentation. We use the word segmentation software \(ICTCLAS\, developed by Chinese Academy of Science, to make Chinese word segmentation. Then we get a complete vocabulary set W of document corpus after stop-words removal, W= {w 1 w 2 w m Let matrix V be the set to record each word’s occurrence state in each document. Here, V ij is defined as the i th word’s occurrence times in document j Different from the traditional VSM, we don’t construct term-by-document matrix immediately instead, we use association rules mining method to deal with the matrix V first  3.2. Association rules analysis   In order to use association rules to analyze the word set, we consider the matrix V as a transaction data set Just like in the transaction database, a transaction includes many items; here a column denotes a document, many rows denote many words in this document. So we map the matrix V into a transaction matrix T. In order to illustrate this mapping process, a simple example is shown in table 1 and table 20.A problem worthy to be noted is that we must map the records denoting words’ more than one times occurrence into multiple records in the new transaction matrix. In other words, all the elements in matrix T are 0 or 1, which represent a word’s occurrence or not in a document respectively. Here, we have the equations 1  sum\(T1+T2\1 T3=D2;   \(1 sum\(T4+T5+T6\=D3  Table  1   Matrix V recording  each word’s occurrence times in documents  D1 D2 D3 W 1 2 0 1 W 2 0 1 3 W 3 2 0 1 W 4 1 1 0  Table  2  Transaction Matrix T recording word’s occurrence or not in transactions  T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 W 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 W 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 W 3 1 1 0 1 0 1 W 4 1 1 0 0 0 0  For convenience, we use ap riori algorithm  find the frequent item-sets based on the matrix T. Then we can get the association rules like W 1 W 2  Here, the concept of association rule is what keywords will occur simultaneously in a document, the following expression can show the co-occurrence support and confidence values of item beijing and item Olympic beijing  Olympic\pport=1.0%,confidence=70 where support value means that there are 1% of documents having beijing\ and Olympic\currently, and confidence value means that there are 70% of documents emerging beijing\ emerge Olympic\he same time On condition that the minconf is high enough, we can be sure that the rules we find are effective, and we can merge these items that comprise rules into wordsset one by one. Then the vocabulary set W’s dimension will be decreased, and we get the new vocabulary set W  3.3 Incremental update  Sometimes we encounter the problem that some new documents are added just after we have constructed the transaction matrix T, when we meet an awkward choice: if we start from scratch, then all the calculations before are wasted; so we name such problem as incremental update problem of constructing transaction matrix T. In this section, we focus on resolving such problem With new documents’ adding into the data corpus set, the process of incremental update is composed of three steps  
726 


 3.3.1. Incremental update of matrix V When new documents are added, what we need to do first is word segmentation to the new documents. Then we need to analyze if there are new words added to the vocabulary set W. We have two different conditions A\ No new words added:  In this situation, it’s easier to update the matrix V to V  and also transaction matrix T to T  Suppose that the number of added documents is dn, dn columns are added in V     11 1 1\(n 1\ 1\(n dn 1 n m\(n+1 m\(n dn VVVV 2 VVVV n mm VV    000§\000 000¨\000 006 000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000 000!\000 000#\000 000 000"\000   B\ Some new words added: If there are new words added into W after new documents adding, the situation becomes a little complicated, which means that matrix V will be extended not only on columns but also rows, just as shown in \(3 11 1 1\(n 1\ 1\(n dn 1 n m\(n+1 m\(n dn n+1 m+1\\(n dn m+wn\\(n+1 n+dn VVVV VVVV 3 0 0  V V 0 0  V V n mm VV     000§\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 006 000¨\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000 000!\000 000#\000 000 000"\000 000"\000 000 000"\000   3.3.2. Increment update of matrix T We can map the dn columns in V+ into several columns in transaction matrix T, then we get T  The process is similar to what above mentioned in section B. All the elements added in matrix T  are 0 or 1 like other columns in T. And we can also get equations of these dn new columns like \(3  3.3.3. Incremental update of Association Rules generation After we get the updated transaction matrix T  the problem has transformed to an incremental update of Association Rules mining. Many different algorithms [6 ha ve b e e n d e ve l o p e d fo r t h a t  task. We use the methods o r ref e ren ce in o u r  process  3.4. Text presentation  With the simplified vocabulary set W’, using the weighted term-frequency vector to represent each document, we construct the term-by-document matrix X 11 1 1 xx X\(4 xx n mmn 000§\000 000¨\000  000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000 000 000#\000%\000 000  The term-frequency vector X i of document d i is defined as T i1i2imi X x  x x  5    During constructing the matrix X, there are many ways to do the feature selection, but we use the most popular method TF/IDF \(term-frequency/inverse document frequency\. The specific methods are shown in \(8 ji ji j n xtlog 6 idf 007  where t ji idf j n denote the term frequency of word w j 010 W in document d i the number of documents containing word fj, and the total number of documents in the corpus, respectively. In addition, X i is normalized to unit Euclidean length. Here, we use X i  as the i th column  4. Case study  In order to validate the effectiveness, we select a simple document set as our data corpus: 10 abstracts of Chinese science literature from magazines relative to Computer Science. These literatures are about   security 033D\031B\024g database\ and EC\004 software We first deal with the document set by the way above mentioned. The process is shown in Figure 1 The process’s Input are: document sets, minsup minconf. Here, the minsup we selected is 1.5%, while the minconf we selected is 70% to ensure the effectiveness of generated association rules. After the whole process, the Output we obtained is term-bydocument matrix X Results indicate that by using association rules mining before data modeling, the vocabulary set decreased 8.63%, which means that in a large data set with 10000 records, association rules mining help delete 863 words. Thus the matrix V and T are also simplified accordingly. During the process of generating association rules, Some highly correlative words-set like Au1k\035\016  computer security 033D 031B\024g 1u database management\ere found

                           Figure  1  Association rules mining based text representation process Furthermore, We use the non-negative matrix factorization \(NMF e t hods t o cl u s t e r W a n d W  to validate the effectiveness of the methods. In order to get results more accurately, we do the experiment three times with and without association rules mining process, and use the metric AC in ed b y    1 D 7 n i i AC n 011   000  to assess the accuracy of clustering. Where  D i 011 is set to 1 if D i is classified correctly, and set to 0 otherwise, and n is the number of documents in the collection The results are shown in table 3.The last line in the table is the average accuracy values From the table we can see that the accuracy of clustering isn’t influenced after the word-merged according to association rules mined, i.e. using association rules mining can simplify the data matrix without decreasing the clustering results. Instead simplified matrix enhances the efficiency of data analysis and leads to clustering accuracy’s increase to some extent    Table 3 002 NMF clustering result with and without association rules mining   5. Summary and future work  In conclusion, the paper gives a try to simplify the problem of text representation before real feature selection and text modeling. Association rules mining helps to solve such problem well During this process of text representation, the incremental update problems of matrix V and transaction matrix T are very interesting directions. We separated these problems into three steps in this paper In fact, if we can give these steps an integrated analysis, maybe we can get even better results, which we will focus on for further study  6.

Used-for references in the LCSH into holonym/meronym relations in our WKB  In the experiments we assume that each topic comes from an individual user We attempt to evaluate our model in an environment that covers great range of topics However it is not realistic to expect a participant to hold such great range of topics in personal interests Thus for the 50 experimental topics we assume each one coming from an individual user and learn her his personalized ontology An LIR is collected through searching the subject catalogue of Queensland University of Technology QUT Library 3 by using the title of a topic Librarians have assigned title table of content summary and a list of subjects to each information item e.g a book stored in QUT library The assigned subjects are treated as the tags in Web documents that cite the knowledge in the WKB  In order to simplify the experiments we only use the librarian summarized information title table of content and summary to represent an instance in an LIR  All these information can be downloaded from QUT's Web site and are available to the public Once the WKB and an LIR are ready an ontology is learned as described in Section 3.3.1 and personalized as in Section 3.3.2 The user con\002dence rates on the subjects are speci\002ed as in Section 3.3.3 A document d i in the training set is then generated by an instance i  and its support value is determined by support  d i   X s 2 021  i  s 2S sup  s Q  14 where s 2 S in O  Q  are as de\002ned in De\002nition 5 As sup  s Q   0 for s 2 S 000 according to Eq 11 the documents with support  d   0 go to D 000  whereas those with support  d   0 go to D   4.4 Performance Measures The performance of the experimental models are measured by three methods the precision averages at eleven standard recall levels 11SPR the mean average precision MAP and the F 1 Measure They are all based on precision and recall the modern IR evaluation methods The 11SPR is reported suitable for information gathering and is used in TREC evaluations as a performance measuring standard An 11SPR v alue is computed by summing the interpolated precisions at the speci\002ed recall cutoff and then dividing by the number of topics P N i 1 precision 025 N  025  f 0  0  0  1  0  2      1  0 g  15 N is the number of topics and 025 are the cutoff points where the precisions are interpolated At each 025 point an aver3 http://library.qut.edu.au Figure 2 Experimental 11SPR Results age precision value over N topics is calculated These average precisions then link to a curve describing the recallprecision performance The MAP is a stable and discriminating choice in information gathering evaluations and is recommended for measuring general-purpose information gathering methods The average precision for each topic is the mean of the precision obtained after each relevant document is retrieved The MAP for the 50 experimental topics is then the mean of the average precision scores of each of the individual topics in the experiments The MAP re\003ects the performance in a non-interpolated recall-precision fashion F 1 Measure is also well accepted by the information gathering community which is calculated by F 1  2 002 precision 002 recall precision  recall  16 Precision and recall are evenly weighted in F 1 Measure For each topic the macro F 1 Measure averages the precision and recall and then calculates F 1 Measure whereas the micro F 1 Measure calculates the F 1 Measure for each returned result and then averages the F 1 Measure values The greater F 1 values indicate the better performance 5 Results and Discussions The experiments attempt to evaluate our proposed model by comparing to an implementation of mental model We expect that the ONTO model can achieve at least the close performance to the TREC model The experimental 11SPR results are illustrated in Fig 2 At recall point 0.3 the TREC model slightly outperformed the ONTO model but at 0.5 and 0.6 the ONTO model achieved better results than the TREC model subtly At all other points their 11SPR results are just the same For the MAP results shown on Table 1 the ONTO model achieved 0.284 which is just 0.006 below the TREC model 2

TREC ONTO p-value Macro-FM 0.388 0.386 0.862 Micro-FM 0.356 0.355 0.896 MAP 0.290 0.284 0.484 Table 1 Other Experimental results downgrade For the average macroand microF 1 Measures also shown on Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
