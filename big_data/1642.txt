INTRODUCTION\nRecent advances in sensor technology have enabled the\nvast deployment of sensors embedded in user devices that\nmonitor various phenomena for different applications of inter-\nest, e.g., air/electrosmog pollution, radiation, early earthquake\ndetection, soil moisture, permafrost melting, etc. Sensors con-\ntinuously produce unbounded time series of measurements\nthat can be erroneous or have missing values posing great\nchallenges for data management. To this end, various model-\nbased sensor data management techniques [1]-[4] have been\nproposed. Models exploit the inherent correlations \(e.g. with\ntime or among data streams math-\nematical function derived by the model within a certain error\nbound. These techniques aim to facilitate query processing by\naccessing or generating minimal amount of data [2], [5] and\ndeal with missing values in data by an abstraction layer over\nthe sensor data [3].\nHowever, proposed model-based query processing ap-\nproaches [2], [3] mostly employ the relational data model and\nprocess queries based on materialized views or interval indices\n[6] on top of modeled segments of sensor data. Alternatively,\nin the cloud era, time series are stored in key value stores [7]\nand query processing is parallelized via MapReduce.\nIn this paper we exploit key-value stores and the MapRe-\nduce parallel computing paradigm, two significant aspects of\ncloud computing, to realize indexing and querying model-\nview sensor data in the cloud. One modeled segment is\ncharacterized by its time and value intervals [2]-[4]. In order\nto process range or point queries on model-view sensor data\n[8], our index in the cloud store should excel in processing\ninterval data. Current key-value built-in indices do not support\ninterval related operations. The interval index for sensor data\nmanagement should not only work on static data set, but it\nshould be dynamically updated based on the new arriving\nsegments of sensor data [9]. If traditional batch-updating or\nperiodical re-building strategy is applied here [10], then the\nhigh speed of sensor data generation may lead to a large\nsize of the new unindexed data set, even in short time, with\nsignificant index updating delay. The performance of queries\ninvolving both indexed and unindexed data will degenerate\ngreatly, thus the interval index in the cloud store should be\nable to be updated based on individual modeled segments in\nan online manner.\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as\nfollows:\n• Innovative interval index: We propose an innovative inter-\nval index for model-view based sensor data management\nin key-value stores, referred to as KVI-index. KVI-index\nis a two-tier structure consisting of one lightweight and\nmemory-resident binary search tree and one index-model\ntable materialized in the key-value store. This composite\nindex structure can dynamically accommodate new sensor\ndata segments very efficiently.\n• Hybrid modeled-segment query processing: After explor-\ning the search operations in the in-memory structure of\nthe KVI-index for range and point queries that locate\nmodeled segments that may satisfy the query, we intro-\nduce a hybrid query processing approach that integrates\nrange scan and MapReduce to process these segments in\nparallel and identify the qualified ones.\n• Intersection search: We introduce an enhanced intersec-\ntion search algorithm \(iSearch processing. We\ntheoretically analyze the efficiency of \(iSearch nodes that it returns.\n• Experimental evaluation: Our framework has been fully\nimplemented, including on-line sensor data segmentation,\nmodeling, KVI-index and the hybrid query processing,\nand it has been thoroughly evaluated against a signifi-\ncant number of alternative approaches. As experimentally\nshown based on real sensor data, our approach signifi-\ncantly outperforms in terms of query response time and\nindex updating efficiency all other ones for answering\ntime/value point and range queries.\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 282\nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: Sec.

to develop interval index for managing\nmodel-view sensor data in key-value stores. The detailed\ndesigns of our innovative KVI-index and the hybrid query pro-\ncessing approach are discussed in Sec. IV and V respectively.\nThen, in Sec. VI, we present thorough experimental results to\nevaluate our approach with traditional query processing ones\non both raw sensor data and modeled data segments. Finally,\nin Sec. VII, we conclude our work.\nII. RELATED WORK\nMany researchers have proposed techniques for managing\nmodeled segments of sensor data in relational databases.\nMauveDB [3] designed a model-based view to abstract under-\nlying raw sensor data; it then used models to project the raw\nsensor readings onto grids for query processing. As opposed to\nMauveDB, FunctionDB [2] only materializes segment models\nof raw sensor data. Symbolic operators are designed to process\nqueries using models rather than raw sensor data. However,\nboth approaches in [3] and [2 do not take into account the\nrole of an index in managing modeled segments of sensor data.\nMany relevant index structures [6], [9], [10] have been\nproposed to manage interval data [11]. However, they all have\nmemory-oriented structure and cannot be directly applied to\nthe distributed environment of key-value cloud stores. Many\nefforts [8]-[ 11] have also been done to externalize these in-\nmemory index data structures. The relational interval tree\(RI-\ntree  and\ntransforms interval queries into SQL queries on tables. This\nmethod makes efficient use of built-in B+-tree indices of\nRDBMS. In [12], they proposed an approach that enables key-\nvalue stores to support query processing of multi-dimensional\ndata via integrating space filing order into row-keys. The latest\neffort for supporting interval index in key-value stores [10]\nutilizes MapReduce to construct a segment tree materialized\nin the key-value store. This approach outperforms the interval\nquery processing provided by HBase http://hbase.apache.orgl http://hive.apache.org  static interval index, as is also the case with\n[13]. Therefore, a segment tree re-building phase needs to be\nperiodically executed to include new data.\nMapReduce parallel computing is an effective tool to ac-\ncess large scale of segment models of sensor data in cloud\nstores. Many researchers proposed index techniques to avoid\ndata scan by MapReduce for low-selective queries [14]. The\nauthors in [15] integrate indices into each file split, so that\nmappers can use index to only access predicate qualified data\nrecords. In [16], indices applicable to queries with predicates\non multiple attributes via indexing different record attributes\nin different block replicas were designed. In [17], a split-\nlevel index is designed to decrease MapReduce framework\noverhead. As compared to record-level optimizations in [15],\n[16], split-level indices eliminate irrelevant file splits before\nlaunching mappers, and thus the data transferring and starting\nup overheads are further saved.\nIII. OVERVIEW OF MODEL-VIEW SENSOR DATA\nMANAGEMENT\nIn this section, we discuss the issues for managing modeled\nsegments of sensor data in a key-value store. First, we explain\nwhat is modeled data segments. Then, we discuss possible stor-\nage schemas for modeled segments and explain the necessity\nto develop a segment model index therein. Last, we describe\nthe query types of our focus and some particular techniques\nfor processing model-view sensor data queries.\nA. Sensor data segmentation\nAmong the objectives of sensor data modeling are to\ncompress the raw data, to fill missing values and to detect\ndata outliers. A typical modeling approach fragments the data\nstream into modeled data segments, and then approximates\neach data segment by a mathematical function with certain\nparameters [18], so that a specific error norm is satisfied.\nQuery processing can then be performed on the materialized\nmodeled data segments instead of the raw sensor data, as\nin [2]. Sensor data segmentation and modelling have been\nextensively studied in [4], [18 19].\nB. Storage model\nOne idea for storing modeled segments in key-value stores\ncould be to do it similarly to that of the raw sensor data storage\nsuch as Open- TSDB [7], and takes the time interval of one\nsegment as the row key \(rk intervals are\nin ascending order. Therefore, although for time range or point\nqueries, the query processor knows when to stop the scan, it\nstill needs to start the scan from the beginning of the table. The\nsame problem happens to the table with value intervals as row-\nkeys. In summary, simply incorporating time, value interval or\nmodel coefficients into the row-key cannot help accelerate the\nquery processing. A generic key-value based interval index\nfor sensor data segments is necessary. Moreover, key-value\nrepresented interval index can take advantage of efficient key\nbased random access, range scan and parallel computing of\nkey-value stores [20].\nC. Querying model-view sensor data\nIn this paper, we focus on the following four types of\nfundamental queries on model-view sensor data.\n• time point query: return the value of one sensor at a\nspecific time point.\n• value point query: return the timestamps when the value\nof one sensor is equal to the query value. There may be\nmultiple time stamps of which sensor values satisfy the\nquery value. .\n• time range query: return the values of one sensor during\nthe query time range.\nvalue range query: return the time intervals of which the\nsensor values are within the query value range. There may\nbe multiple time intervals of 


which sensor values satisfy\nthe query value range.\nThe generic process to query model-view sensor data\nqueries comprises the following two steps:\n283\n• Searching of qualified modeled segments: The qualified\nmodeled segments are defined as the ones of which time\n\(resp. value resp.\nvalue range or point. This step should make use of\nan interval index to localize all the qualified modeled\nsegments in the segment model store.\n• Model gridding: In model-view sensor data management\nsystem, only modeled segments are usually materialized,\ninstead of raw data values. Qualified modeled segments\nare too abstract and a finite set of data points are more\nuseful as query results [2]. Therefore, model gridding\nis another necessary process [2], [3]. Model gridding\nstep applies three operations to each qualified segment:\n\(i discretizes the time interval of the segment at a\nspecific granularity to generate a set of time points ii segment. \(iii or value points from\ngridding all qualified modeled segments are returned as\nquery results.\nIV. KEY-VALUE INTERVAL INDEX\nWe will first present the design of the two-tier model\nindex on key-value stores then we will discuss the updating\nalgorithm of the model index.\nA. Structure of KVI-index\nWe propose the key-value represented interval index \(KVI-\nindex interval tree is chosen here, because in-memory\ninterval tree's primary-secondary structure is convenient for\nexternalization to the key-value store [6]. Furthermore, the\nsearching and scanning algorithm of the interval tree to process\nqueries is fit for being implemented via the MapReduce com-\nputing paradigm to enhance query processing performance.\nOur KVI-index is a novel in-memory and key-value com-\nposite index structure. The virtual searching tree\(vs-tree key-value\nstore is devised to materialize the secondary structure\(SS structure: The in-memory virtual searching\ntree\(vs-tree a Each time \(or value first overlaps\nalong the searching path from root. This node is defined as\nregistration node T for this interval. Each node of vs-tree has\nan associated secondary structure\(SS store, which stores the substantial information of the\nmodeled segments registered at this node.\nWe apply space-partition strategy for vs-tree. The height of\nthe vs-tree is denoted by h. We set the value of leftmost leaf\nnode as O. For negative sensor data values, we use simple\nshifting to have the data range start from 0 for convenience.\nThen, the domain of the vs-tree is [0,R] and R = 2\(h+l 1. During the whole life\nof KVI-index, only the root value r is kept, since, due to the\nlightweight computability of the space-partition, the value of\neach node in the searching path from the root to the node\nthat has the queried point or interval can be calculated in run\ntime. All the operations on vs-tree are performed in memory\nand are thus very efficient. As the domains of time and value\nof the sensor data are different, two vs-trees one for times\nand another for values are kept in memory simultaneously for\nanswering time and value queries respectively.\nFig. 1. Two-tier structure of KVI-index\n2 a novel index-model\ncomposite storage schema, which enables one table not only\nto store the modeled segments but also to materialize the\nstructural information of the vs-tree, i.e., the SSs for each tree\nnode.\nThe index-model table is shown in Fig.I\(b the data segment shown in the black dotted rectangle\nin Fig.I\(c the\ninterval of an indexed modeled segment at that node. One\nmodeled segment's time, value interval and coefficients are all\nstored in different columns of the same row. So far, the SSs of\neach node correspond to a consecutive range of tuples in the\nindex-model table. For instance, the rows corresponding to the\nSSs of node 1, node 5 and node 13 in vs-tree are illustrated in\nFig. I\(b that\ncorrespond to time and value vs-trees respectively.\nB. KVI-index updates\nThe complete modeled segment updating algorithm of KVI-\nindex is shown in the Alg. 1. It includes two processes:\n\(1 searching: localize the node T at\nwhich one time\(value  2 Materialization of modeled segments: construct the row-\nkey based on the T and materialize one modeled segment's\ninformation into the columns of corresponding row.\n1 rSearch algorithm\nfirst involves a domain expansion process to dynamically\nadjust the domain of the vs-tree according to the domain\nvariation of the sensor data. Then, the registration node can\nbe found on the validated vs-tree.\nLemma 1: For a modeled segment M, with time\(value  tree rooted at\n2 I1og\(rt+ 2 rt+ 2 I1og\(rt+2 rt+ 2 rt+ 2  in a tree rooted\nat 2 I1og\(r t + 2 value

For instance, if the\nquery processor requires to access all the modeled segments\nstored at registration node 5, then we know that all the\ncorresponding modeled segments lie in the rows within the\nrow-key range [< 5, a >, < 6, a ». For example, take the\nmodell and model2 in Fig. 3. First, the KVI-index checks\nwhether the starting modeled segments of node5 and nodel5,\nnamely rows with key < 5, a > and < 15, a exist. Then,\nthe row key < 5,4,6 > is constructed for modell as the SS\nof node5 has been initialized, whilst KVI -index constructs the\nrow key < 15, a > for model2.\nrow-key construction\nV. QUERY PROCESSING VIA KVI-INDEX AND\nMAPREDUCE\nProof: The current vs-tree's height is hand It ::; r, the\ninterval [It, rt] rides over the root node r. Assume we don't\nexpand the domain and hang [It, rt] on r. When a new model\nM j with a time \(or value interval [l~, -: and l~ > R comes,\nthe root value has to increase to r' =2I1ogT~+2l-1_1 as [l~, -:\nintersects no node of current vs-tree. Then between rand r,\nthere is one node with value 2\(h+l It, rt is\nstored at node r = 2h-l and rt > 2\(h+l h+l rt]'s registration on node\nr contradicts with the interval registration rule. •\nmodel 1:\nmodel 2:\nmodel 3:\nmodel 4:\nindex and model table\nrow key columns\nnode value, interval tl,tr vl,vr pO, p1, p2\n1,0: [0,2 1.4,5.7] 1.4,5.7,4.2\n5,0: [4,5] [4.5,9.5] 4.5,9.5,1.2\n5,[4,6]~~:[~,6] ~~:~;] ~~:::~:~~ ~:::~:~:~:~\n15,0 7,[4,10] [4,10] [3.2,7.4] 3.2,7.4,5.3\n11,0: ~ 11,0: [9,14] [2.4,4.3] 0.2,1.3,4.65\n230: 15,0: [6,16] [6,10.3 6,10.3,5.1\n. --------------\n2 3t [20~251 [7.~9.21 7.5.9.2.4.1\nFig. 3.

Then, the sub-sequential model2 and model3 can be\nupdated successfully.\n2 Materialization of modeled segment: When materializ-\ning model M, into the SS of a node T, the row-key may be\nchosen in two ways:\n• Upon initialization of the SS of node T: when no modeled\nsegment has been stored at T'S SS, the row key is chosen\nas < T, a > for model Mi. Here, a is a postfix of row\nkey to indicate that this row is the starting position of T'S\nFor querying model-view sensor data, the searching process\nof qualified modeled segments \(defined in Sec.!II intersection search on\nvs-tree is used for range queries, while point search is\nemployed for point queries They are responsible for\ncollecting the nodes that accommodate qualified modeled\nsegments [6], [9] in their secondary structures SSs.\n• Modeled-segment filtering: Due to the rule for interval\nregistration at the nodes of the vs-tree, the SS of a node\nmay contain some intervals irrelevant to queried range or\npoint [6], [8 13]. In KVI-index, the SSs of all nodes\nfound by the search operation are accessed to filter out\nunqualified segments.\nAfter the above two steps, model gridding component\nfetches the coefficients of each qualified modeled segment\nand performs gridding. Next, we first describe an enhanced\nintersection search algorithm on vs-tree that benefits KVI-\nScan- MapReduce query processing introduced later in this\nsection. We then present the point search algorithm on vs-\ntree. Subsequently, we introduce our novel hybrid KVI -Scan-\nMapReduce query processing. Last, we theoretically analyze\nthe enhanced intersection search algorithm of the KVI-index.\n285\nA Intersection and point search\n1 a time \(resp. value  It, r t]. The nodes on the searching path from the root node\nto the one preceding T form a node set denoted by So. The\ni.Search:r stops at the node, which is closest to the left-end\npoint It. All the nodes along the 


left-descending path form\na node set, denoted by Si, while the node with the minimum\nvalue in this path is denoted by Is. Analogously, S; is the node\nset from the right-descending path and r s is the node with\nthe maximum value in this path. Any node outside the range\n[Is, r s] and the set So does not have any qualified modeled\nsegments.\nAlgorithm 2: isearch+ of vs-tree\nInput: time query range [It, rt], root value r\nOutput: node set So and V\nbegin\n/* construct So\nnode=r; h=log\(r h ~ 0 It S; node and rt ~ node break; /* node is the registration node\nelse\nSo = So U node\nif \(It >node rt <node ldJ, r;> R - 2 Llog\(R-Tt  It, rt] for further modeled-segment filtering\nand gridding. Our isearch+ outputs the discrete node set So\nand a consecutive range of nodes D = [Is, rs]. For example,\ntake the range query in Fig. 4\(a registration node\nof query range [6,10]. The traditional iSearch returns the\ndiscrete node sets shown in the solid boxes of Fig. 4\(a  the output of isearch+ benefits the hybrid\nquery processing later in Subsection V-B.\n2 denote the point search by sSearch\nas it functions as the stabbing search of interval tree. The\nsSearch is a binary search that records the nodes along the\ndescending path. We present the sSearch in Fig. 4\(a For\nexample, when querying the sensor value of time point 24,\nthe node set So = {15, 7,11,9, 10} is returned by sSearch.\nSince there is no split searching, as in isearch+, only one\nnode set is produced here. We denote this node set by So as\nwell, so as to facilitate the description of the hybrid KVI -Scan-\nMapReduce query processing that follows next.\nB. KVI-Scan-MapReduce query processing\nWe first analyze the location distribution of the SSs of the\nnodes found by i.Search" and sSearch in the index-model\ntable. The characteristics of this distribution inspired us to\npropose the hybrid KVI-Scan-MapReduce query processing\napproach.\n1 index-model table, described below.\n• So: The SSs of So are non-consecutive and sparsely\ndistributed in the index-model table. The node value\nis the primary part of the row-key; thus, the distance\nbetween SSs of So depends on the numerical difference\nof node values. As So includes the nodes from root\nnode to the one preceeding the T, the intra-distances\nbetween any consecutive nodes in So are 2h - i , where\ni = 0,··· ,h - d is the position of the node in the\ndescending search path So and d.; is the depth of T.\nObviously, the intra-distances in So are greater than those\nfor other nodes below T in the search path.\n• D: The SSs of [ls r s] are clustered around the ones of\n[It, rt] in the index-model table. The SSs of [It, rt] are\nall adjacent in the index-model table. The SSs of [Is, r s]\nare bounded by those of the sub-tree rooted at T and the\nnodes in [ls,rs] are a superset of the nodes in [It,rt]. The\ndeeper the registration node T is located, the tighter the\nset of the SSs of [ls,rs] over those of [It,rt].\nFor example, take the time \(or value  in\nFig. 4\(a  covers the node\nrange E = [0,14] and DeE. From Fig. 4\(b  and bounded by the SSs\nof E. However, node15's SS is located far away from those of\n[3,11].\nIf SSs of So and D are processed via straightforward\nrandom access and range scan provided by key-value stores,\nthe entire modeled-segment filtering and gridding processes\nare conducted locally at the application side. For a table\nof multiple or hundreds of GBs, the communication and\ncomputation costs are prohibitively high for the application\nside even for low-selective queries.\nThe modeled segment filtering-gridding processing matches\nMapReduce's filtering-aggregation paradigm. Considering the\nresearch results from [15]-[17], for CPU non-intensive work-\nload, I/O cost, network latency and starting-up overhead of\nmappers are dominant in the execution time of MapReduce\nprograms. If the SSs of So and D are all processed by MapRe-\nduce, a lot of time is wasted for mappers that process irrelevant\nSSs in the index-model table. This is because MapReduce will\naccess the continuous regions of the table including the SSs of\nnodes between the So and D due to the sequential data feeding\nmechanism in the mapping phase. For example, in Fig. 4\(b  So={15} are distant in the table.\nHence, MapReduce will launch many un-necessary mappers\nfor the irrelevant SSs of nodes between 11 and 15, in order to\nprocess the SSs of So and D.\n2 gridding: As discussed\nabove, simply using range scan or MapReduce to process\nSSs are both problematic. Our idea is to design a hybrid\nKVI-Scan-MapReduce paradigm that combines range scan and\nMapReduce for processing SSs, as follows:\n\(1 R is limited. As the\n286\nFig. 4. Workflow of KVI-Scan-MapReduce approach. \(a b location distribution for the range query. \(c 1 4 the index-model table\nand each SS of So can be considered as a small range of\nclustered index, the random-access- and range-scan-based\nmodel filtering and gridding is suitable.\n• \(2  


successive range [ls, r s] delimits a\ntight boundary of the sub-index-model table over the rele-\nvant SSs that are suitable for processing with MapReduce.\nThis hybrid paradigm eliminates the Map-phase processing\nof SSs of irrelevant nodes between So and D and the nodes\nbetween the elements of So. Moreover, it is non-intrusive for\nboth the key-value store and MapReduce. Regarding the time\n\(or value node set So without\nD, hence, only range-scan-based model filtering and gridding\nis needed.\nSuppose that the number of reducers is P and each reducer\nis denoted by 0"" ,P-l. For range queries, the partition\nfunction f is used to assign the qualified modeled segments\ninto different reducers. It is designed on the basis of query\ntime \(resp. value  resp. [lv, rvD and the time \(or\nvalue  modeled segment i. The idea is\nthat each of the reducers is in charge of one even sub-range\nrtpl t. Such a partition function f is given in Eq. 1.\n{\nl < r. < r l\(ri-ld*PJf\(ri functionalities of mappers and reducers are depicted in\ndetail below.\n• Mapper: Each mapper gets the time resp. value  resp. value function f\(ri Reducer: One reducer receives a list of qualified modeled\nsegments < pb"" ,Po >, < pi,... ,p? >, .... For each\nmodeled segment < P; ,... ,pr .>, the reducer invokes a\nmodel-based gridding function to compute discrete values\nas query results.\nRegarding the scan-based model filtering and gridding, as\nSSs in So are located in different regions of the index-model\ntable, the query processor makes use of thread pool to process\neach SS of So in parallel. Fig. 4 shows the workflow of the\nhybrid KVI-Scan-MapReduce approach. For a time \(or value   nodes in Dare\nsent to MapReduce. The SS of nodel5, enclosed by the bottom\ndot-dashed block, is processed via range scan.\nC. Theoretical analysis\nOne point to carefully consider is that is earch+ may\ngenerate redundant nodes, because the isearch+ aims to find\na tight and consecutive range of SSs for MapReduce. For\ninstance, in Fig. 4\(a MapReduce.\nTheorem 1: For a range query [It, r.l- the redundant nodes\nin [ls, rs] returned by i Search" are bounded.\nProof' Assume the height of the registration node T as\nh. Consider the left-descending path from T to the node lo\nclosest to It. Let d be the depth from which the descending\npath turns right, namely the value w It of the current node.\nThen, based on the isearch+ algorithm, w is the left boundary\nof accessed node range and w = T - 2::1=1 2h - i .\nFor a certain value of d, the worst case happens when the\ndescending process continues to go right until reaching la,\nas the nodes between wand lo are all redundant ones. The\nnumber of nodes returned by isearch+ under this case is\ngiven by: d .\nU=T-\(T-L2 h-1 2 ware all included into the output\nrange D of i.Search.v . The number of nodes returned by the\nconventional iSearch is given bYd h\nV=h-d+{T-\(T- L2h - i+ L 2h - i 3 nodes returned by\ni.Search" is given by: h\nf = U - V =d + L 2h - i - h\ni=d+1\n=d + 2h - d - h - 1\nThe Eq. 4 is a function of d and is monotonous decreasing in\nd's domain [1, h]. Consequently, when d = 1, the function f\nreaches the maximum value, namely, the number of redundant\nnodes from i.Search." attains the maximum value Therefore,\nfmax = 2h - 1 - h . \(5 is 2h - 1, hence\n1 1f < 2TJ - log\(TJ + 1 6 the\nrange [ls, rs] is bounded. •\nThe worst case happens when the endpoints It and rtare\nthe preceeding and succeeding nodes of T, namely It = T - 1\nand rt = T + 1. However, for most of the cases, the redundant\nnodes returned from i.Search" are very limited.\nVI. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nFirst, we compare model-view sensor data query processing\nwith conventional one over raw sensor data. Then, we show\nthat our KVI-Scan-MapReduce \(KSM approach outperforms\nother model-view sensor data querying approaches. Finally, we\nexperimentally explore the factors that affect the performance\nof KVI-Scan-MapReduce.\nA. Setup\nWe employ accelerometer data from mobile phones as\nsensor data set. The size of raw sensor data is 22 GB in-\ncluding 200 millions data points. After modeling, the modeled\nsegments of the sensor data take 12 GB, while there are around\n25 millions modeled segments.\nWe developed our system using the versions of Hbase\nand Hadoop in Cloudera CDH4.3.0. The experiments are\nperformed on our own cluster that consists of 1 master node\nand 8 slaves. The master node has 64GB RAM 3TB disk\nspace \(4 x 1TB disks in RAID5 Intel Xeon E5-2630 slave node has 6 cores\n2.30 GHz \(Intel Xeon E5-2630 3 x 2TB disks connected via 1GB Ethernet.\nIn the experiment results, we refer to query selectivity as the\nratio of the number of qualified modeled segments over that\nof total modeled segments.\nRegarding the online sensor data model-based segmentation,\nwe applied the PCA\(piecewise constant approximation  approximation \(PCA 


segment \(referred to as the cache filter segmentation [18]\nand upload them into the key-value store. Regarding gridding,\nwe choose 1 second as the time granularity for discretization\nof a modeled segment. The gridding granularity is a parameter\ndepending on end-user requirements.\nB. Model-view sensor data vs. raw sensor data\nRaw sensor data is a set of discrete data points each of which\nhas associated timestamp and value. We create two tables,\nwhich respectively take the timestamp and sensor value as\nthe row-keys, such that the query range or point can be used\nas keys to locate the qualified data points. Then, the query\nprocessor invokes the MapReduce to access the large size of\ndata points for query results.\nFig. 5 \(a b c and point queries respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 5 \(a b than the raw sensor data method for\nboth time and value range queries. Although the raw sensor\ndata based methods apply MapReduce to directly access the\nqualified tuples via the row-key based range scan, the amount\nof raw sensor data to process is much larger than that of the\nmodel-view approach. In Fig. 5\(c processing time of the\nraw data based method is 2 x less than that of the model-view\none in time point queries, because the raw data method can\nuse the query time point as index key to directly access the\nrelevant data points, while our KSM requires to perform model\nfiltering and gridding. For value point queries, the model-view\napproach has nearly 3 x less time than the raw data method.\nAs normally there is a large size of data points with the query\nvalue, MapReduce is used to access this qualified sensor data\nset. In model-view approach, the point query processing only\nuses random access and range scan to get qualified modeled\nsegments for gridding locally, and thus it saves the time on\nstarting MapReduce to access data.\nC. Comparison of model-view approaches\nThere are four baseline approaches for querying model-view\nsensor data namely:\nMapReduce \(MR the whole\nindex-model table to filter the qualified modeled segments in\nthe mapping phase and perform the model gridding in the\nreduce phase.\nInterval tree \(IT operations of the interval tree [6], [9] by adding\nanother table to store the SS of each node sorted by the right\nend-point of intervals. Each index, time or value, has two\nassociated tables. During the intersection or point search on vs-\ntree, the query processor decides which table to access based\non the relation between the query range \(or point encountering one unqualified modeled segment, due to\nthe monotonicity of end-points of modeled segments. IT makes\nuse of random access and range scan to sequentially filter the\nqualified modeled segments and make gridding locally.\nMapReduce+KVI \(MRK process the whole\ntable. In MRK, MapReduce is designed to work over one\ncontinuous sub-index-model table including all the SSs of\nthe accessed nodes in search operations. For instance, in Fig.\n4\(a or value  16, a >]. The same idea applies for point\nqueries. As compared to our hybrid KSM approach, MRK is\na lightweight indexing-MapReduce plan, as it processes many\nirrelevant SSs of nodes between So and V.\nFilter of key-value store \(FKV support\npredicate-based row selection. The filter transmits the filtering\npredicate to each region server and then all servers scan their\nlocal data in parallel. Afterwards, they return the qualified\ntuples. Our filter-based query processing also works on the\nindex-model table, as the filtering predicates can be directly\napplied to the columns. The query processor waits until all\n288\nFig. 5. Query performance of range and point queries\nregion servers finish scans and then it retrieves each returned\nqualified modeled segment to conduct gridding locally.\n1 a b c queries. As depicted in Fig.6\(a the query selectivity increases, the amount of SSs\nfor scan based processing decreases and that for MapReduce\napproaches the entire table. Therefore, the response time\nincreases and approaches that of MR. The response time of\nMR increases little. As increasing query selectivity leads to\nascending gridding workload in reduce phase, these results\nshow that the overhead from model gridding is not dominant\nin MR. The response time of MRK is more than that of KSM,\nbut less than that of MR. As MRK utilizes the KVI-index\nto localize a consecutive sub-index-model table covering all\nthe SSs of nodes found by intersection search, it processes\nfewer modeled segments than MR's full table scanning. Yet,\nas compared to KSM, MRK processes more redundant modeled\nsegments. Moreover, as the sub-table in MRK covers a large\nrange, the processing time of MRK increases little for low-\nselective queries.\nFig.6\(b FKV needs to wait for each region server of\nHBase to finish the local data scanning, its total response time\nis a little longer than that of IT approach. They both consume\nmuch more time than all MR, MRK and KSM 


as they apply\nsequential accessing of modeled segments.\nWe also analyse the number of modeled segments accessed\nby each approach in Fig. 6\(c segments affect\nthe performance. MR works on the entire table, thus, the\nnumber of accessed segments is the same. From the point\nof view of the application, only qualified modeled segments\nare returned for gridding thus FKV processes no redundant\nmodeled segments and consumes the least amount of modeled\nsegments. Since IT scans the SS of one node until encountering\nan unqualified model, the total number of accessed segments\nis a little larger than that of FKV. Our KSM processes larger\nnumber of segments than both IT and FKV due to the\ncontinuous and redundant range of SSs found by isearch+.\nHowever, the results also verify our theoretical analysis that\nthe amount of redundant modeled segments is bounded. MRK\naccesses more segments than IT, FKV and KSM, as it adds\nthe SSs between So and V to form a continuous sub-table\nfor MapReduce. Referring to Fig. 6\(a and Fig. 6\(b efficient.\nFig. 6 \(d e f approaches exhibit\nsimilar patterns as for the time range queries, so we skip the\ndetailed analysis.\n2 Query: The time and value point query processing\nperformance are shown in Fig. 6\(g value point queries. The response time of KSM is a little\ngreater than IT, but outperforms the other approaches, because\nIT is able to access all qualified modeled segments in one SS.\nHowever, the KSM scans the whole SS entries of a node to find\nthe qualified ones. Because of the invocation of MapReduce\nand redundant modeled segments in the sub-table, MRK takes\nmore time than both IT and KSM. But, as MRK does not work\non the entire table as MR does, it takes about 2 x less time\nthan MR. FKV consumes the most time as it needs to wait for\nserver-side full table scan before gridding operations. Since the\nsize of the domain of the sensor data values is smaller than\nthat of the time domain, nodes in value vs-tree accommodate\nmore modeled segments than time vs-tree nodes. Thus, the\nresponse times of value point queries of IT, FKV and KSM\napproaches are all more than those of time point queries. For\nMR and MRK, the processing time differences between time\nand value queries are insignificant, as the time spent on model\nfiltering and gridding is not dominant.\nD. Insights into KVI-Scan-MapReduce\nThis experiment aims to reveal how much time KSM spends\non model gridding, which is an additional step, as compared\nto querying raw sensor data. Due to space constraints, we only\nshow the results from time range queries of selectivity from\n10% to 50%. From Fig. 6\(h for 1/3 - 1/2 of the total processing time. As the\nmajority of the gridding work is performed in the reduce phase\nand the amount of qualified segments for reducers depends\non the query selectivity, the time spent on model gridding\nincreases with the query selectivity. If the model gridding can\nadapt to users' different requirements for query results, the\nperformance of KSM can be further improved.\n289\nFig. 6. Query performance a c d g g h constitution\nVII. CONCLUSION\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\nexplore the key-value representation of an interval index for\nmodel-view based sensor data management. Different from\nconventional external-memory index structure with complex\nnode merging and split mechanisms, our KVI-index resident\npartially in memory and partially materialized in the key-value\nstore, is easy to maintain in the dynamic sensor data generation\nenvironment. Moreover, we proposed a hybrid query pro-\ncessing approach, namely KVI-Scan-MapReduce, integrating\nthe KVI-index, range scan and MapReduce for model-view\nsensor data in key-value stores. Extensive experiments in a\nreal testbed showed that our approach outperforms in terms\nof query response time and index updating efficiency not only\nquery processing methods based on raw sensor data but also\nall other approaches considered based on model-view sensor\ndata for time/value range and point queries. As a future work,\nwe plan to explore how to process time and value composite\nqueries based on KVI-index.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. Sathe, T. G. Papaioannou, H. Jcung, and K.

We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
