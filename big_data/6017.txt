An Induction-based Compaction of Sets of Association Rules among Web Concepts  Mauricio Minuto Espil LIFIA, Universidad Nacional de La Plata Argentina  Juan M. Ale Universidad de Buenos Aires and Universidad Austral Argentina   Abstract Association rules are nowadays regarded as robust vehicles for creating Web recommendations. We present an induction-based technique for creating a compact representation of sets of association rules, particularly intended for publishing the compact representation in the Web. Our technique efficiently induces a defeasible logic program from a set of association rules in a manner that the complete set of the given associations can be concluded, when integrating the induced compact program within a defeasible logic reasoning framework Keywords- Association Rules Discovery; Web Ontologies; Data Mining Post-Processing; Defeasible Logic Reasoning I.  INTRODUCTION E-business and e-commerce portals are mainly intended for companies that offer the service of on-line transactions to clients. Since web-services become available to the outside of owner boundaries, many companies have started the encapsulation of their facilities in the form of web services Companies are progressively adopting public protocols of wide-spread use in order to allow machine-driven transactions in addition to the human-driven transactions available through their portals. Since business and commerce imply advertising it has become evident that some form of "semantic" advertising added to service description is also needed for potential machine" clients to asses the potential of the service provided B2B is an area where the knowledge of the state and evolution of the market is central. Association rules have been recently considered as robust vehicles for producing recommendations [27], and mining algorithms has been developed specially for the issue [20]. In B2B, publishing association rules on the history of the transactions of some 


company may result crucial for gaining markets. That is association rules may become data potentially appreciated in web-service based B2B Besides, the reader must notice that an association rule from an itemset I1 to an itemset I2 implies the existence of a logical relation among two conceptual classes: the class of transactions that involve itemset I1 and the class of transactions that involve both itemsets I1 and I2. More specifically, it implies a subsumption relation, in the sense that the extension of the last class is contained in the extension of the first one, with extra quantitative information provided on the degree of participation of the subsumed class into the more general one confidence support subsumption relations thence, association rules can be easily encoded in OWL, RDF and RDFS [32, 33, 34 implication is important regarding the fact that the assembling and filtering of association rules through the use of ontologies has shown concrete gain in terms of informative power [23]. It turns out therefore extremely desirable to incorporate association rules to web service description documents EXAMPLE 1: The association rule from class I1 to class I2 can be encoded as follows          In the fragment above, only a new namespace has been added def-ar rdfs:subclassOf: def-ar:support, informing the observed support threshold, and def-ar:confidence, informing the observed confidence threshold A. Recommendation and Association Rules Mining Algorithms for association discovery that scale well on large amounts of transaction data have been developed and are well-known, as A-Priori [1], DIC [9], FPgrowth [15], and more recently [5]. Nevertheless, those algorithms are not particularly intended to be used for creating recommendation in machine 


oriented transactions. The algorithms available for discovering association rules were devised with a purpose in mind analysis. According to the models available for defining analytical rule interest  statistically or empirically  [16, 18 interesting association rules are those that exhibit certain signifying measures \(called here generically parameters as high confidence and good support. The actual discovered values of parameters are thence of extreme importance for owl:Class rdf:ID="I1 owl:Class rdf:ID="I2 owl:Class rdf:ID="I1andI2 owl:intersectionOf owl:Class rdf:resource="#I1 owl:Class rdf:resource="#I2 owl:intersectionOf owl:Class rdf:Description rdf:about="#I1andI2 rdfs:subclassOf  rdf:resource="#I1 def-ar:support="5.100 def-ar:confidence="93.100 rdf:Description 978-1-4244-4840-1/10/$25.00 2010 IEEE analysts. Analysts, however, do not need to attend to all the associations that are present in the data, since some of the mined rules may show no analytical importance. The analysts would rather provide thresholds to parameter values to filter the potential result according to interest criteria, and normally the thresholds provided are high and the number of rules obtained small. Thresholds thus serve as pruning devices for analysis Recommendation is a somewhat different matter. Informing clients of the applied thresholds instead of the actual parameter values of each rule seems sufficient for advertising. Moreover although the number of exhibited rules should not be very large as it was the case of analysis interactions is central -, filtering through analytical signifying thresholds does not seem desirable in this context. It could imply a drastic reduction in recommendations that clients would appreciate. Other schemes of reduction are thus needed Nonetheless, whenever possible, all rules should be shown albeit in compact form B. Rule Set Compaction 


The compaction problem has received attention from the data mining community since the very beginning [6, 21 Several pre, in and post-processing reduction techniques have been proposed [7, 8, 11, 23, 30]. In those approaches; the rules exhibited are restricted only to those that match given patterns non-matching rules are not shown. Because no reasoning framework is provided, the user cannot deduce all the pruned rules from the exhibited set From a different perspective, different notions of closures and minimal covers have also been employed for reducing the number of rules to show [10, 24, 25, 31]. Those approaches based on formal concept analysis, prune redundant rules and allow the inference of all pruned rules. Nonetheless, they fail in discovering patterns characterizing the singularities present within each particular dataset when considering redundancy the patterns employed and the deduction mechanism \(closure computation More general approaches have also been attempted. A series of induction mechanisms were introduced in [12, 17, 28 showing techniques for the induction of queries on itemsets that mine associations from frequent itemsets; the queries acting as a compact representation of the rules. Those approaches, however, fail in real compaction. The presence of all itemsets with their respective frequencies is necessary for reconstructing the rules from the induced queries In this paper, we present a different approach. Since the relation among defeasible logic [3] and semantic web applications is closer, from the descriptive side [26], and from the normative side \(particularly when e-commerce is involved 13 settings is worth exploring. This is the subject of this work We present therefore an algorithm that produces a compact representation of the given set of association rules through a defeasible logic program [3, 4], a triplet formed upon a upon association predicates on pairs of terms denoting itemset classes, which represent, semantically, association rules that are present in the given set b with itemset variables, that represent particular inference rules that characterise the given set c 


ciations that can be wrongly implied from associations and assumptions, and semantically represent a set of association rules that are not present in the given set A linear-time framework for non-monotonically reasoning with programs is defined, in a manner that the set of all derived ground instances \(associations triplet, and a PTIME induction algorithm is then presented for inducing a compaction from a given set of associations, used as positive examples in a machine-learning manner. All and only all the given associations can be inferred from the induced program; the program showing therefore a compaction principle, in the sense that assumptions entail implicit associations Our approach is closer to the spirit of [14, 19]. The difference relies in scope. While the cited works have the identification of legal \(meta legal argumentation as a goal, our approach only aims at producing a compaction. The difference is significant, because in the cited approaches an association is regarded as a defeasible sentence, thus turning the approach more oriented to discover nested defeasible rules [29]. Moreover, an optimal is searched there, thus leading to intractability and the consequent use of heuristics, in that case on the legal domain which is not ours C. Compaction by Induction EXAMPLE 2: Let us have the association rules shown in Table 1, mined from a real set provided by the branch of a major banking institution, with ? 0.6 as threshold for confidence and 0.05 as threshold for support. We observe a frequent pattern to hold on the rule-set that tells us the following: if this is the case that the antecedent \(the left side of the association some rule r \(the pattern body to match disjoint itemsets i1 and i2, then it is likely to find within the set a rule r' \(the pattern head to conclude to one of the itemsets i1 or i2 and the consequent \(the right side of the association TABLE I.  SET EXAMPLE 1-A?B 11-BC?G 21-G?BC 2-A?C 12-BG?C 22-H?C 3-A?I 13-C?A 23-H?I 4-A?CI 14-C?I 24-H?CI 5-AB?H 15-CG?B 25-I?A

Henceforth the pattern can be used here for safely pruning the rules concluded from the head; provided a deductive mechanism exists that allows the pruned rules to be deduced through the application of the pattern to the appropriate remaining rules, with account of the discovered counter-examples. On this basis, we can safely prune, in the order that follows, rules 3\(6 6 7 26\(7 11 12 12 15 16 16 17 23\(18 the rule number in parenthesis denoting the rule matching the pattern body rules: A?H, B?H, C?G, C?B and C?H are not members of the set of rules and are although deduced from the pattern The reconstruction mechanism must account for them as counter-examples, in order to avoid deduction inaccuracies According to Example 2, if we could induce, with an appropriate induction mechanism, the meta-rule: For any 3 ary tuple of itemsets X, Y, and Z, whenever a rule from X union Y X and Y disjoint support ? ?0.05, conclude that a rule from X to Z also holds with the same confidence and support thresholds we could safely prune rules from the set of rules, with no information loss; the pruned rules could always be inferred, in the classical sense, from the meta-rule and the associations remaining in the pruned set. Since rules A?H, B?H, C?G, C?B and C?H would be also classically  and wrongly  inferred, our induction mechanism should produce counter-arguments of the form do not conclude rule r with a confidence ? ?0.6 and a support ? ?0.05, for each wrongly inferable rule r, in order to defeat its classical derivation. The inference mechanism needed should thus produce defeasible conclusions; they must be abandoned whenever a stronger counterargument is present. In addition, the example shows that, if we count non-pruned rules 


meta-rules and defeaters as plain rules, the information presented to the client is smaller in number than the whole set of the given associations. We have just produced a compaction of the set EXAMPLE 3: The meta-rule encountered in Example 2 can be encoded in an rdf-style, and added to a descriptive document as follows        EXAMPLE 4: The first counter-example can also be added as follows          Meta-classes in Example 3 are class variables, names denoting classes generically. Intersection of meta-classes corresponds to intersection among the classes substituting the variables. The counter-example in Example 4 is encoded as defeating a potential subsumption with appropriate values for support and confidence. It is rather a general claim than a particular one The fragment shown in Example 3 together with all counter-examples found on Example 2 encoded as shown in Example 4, plus the non-pruned rules from Example 2 coded as shown in Example 1 constitute a document that results a compaction of the set of all rules exhibited in Table 1 providing that there exists a closure notion from a reasoning device capable of reconstruct the entire given set if needed If the induction mechanism is sufficiently aware in detecting non-straightforward meta-rules, as the meta-rule encoded in Example 3, the pruning mechanism could be 


applied as a complement of the reduction mechanism based on cover computation defined in [24, 25], and the reduction mechanism of redundant rules in the sense of [31], producing more reduction. Our reduction mechanism is able to identify general inference rules \(as those of [24, 25, 31 general redundant rules in consequence, and may also identify patterns present only within the given particular set, as the meta-rule identified in Example 3, not considered in any of the reduction schemes from [24, 25, 31], showing therefore a stronger compaction power D. Paper Organization The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we present formally the logic for reasoning on association rules. In Section 3, we present an algorithm for inducing a program - in the presented logic - from a set of association rules mined from data. In Section 4, we show experimental results that assess the effectiveness of our framework with respect to the compaction goal. In Section 5, we discuss our approach from an implementation perspective, and in Section 6 we conclude def-ar:metaClass rdf:ID="X def-ar:metaClass rdf:ID="Y def-ar:metaClass rdf:ID="Z def-ar:metaClass rdf:ID="XandY def-ar:intersectionOf def-ar:metaClass rdf:resource="#X def-ar:metaClass rdf:resource="#Y def-ar:intersectionOf def-ar:metaClass def-ar:metaRule  def-ar:support="5.100 def-ar:confidence="60.100 def-ar:antecedentRule rdf:Description rdf:about="#XandY def-ar:subclassOf rdf:resource="#Z rdf:Description def-ar:antecedentRule def-ar:consequentRule rdf:Description rdf:about="#X def-ar:subclassOf rdf:resource="#Z rdf:Description def-ar:consequentRule def-ar:metaRule owl:Class rdf:ID="A

FORMAL FRAMEWORK We have explained in the introduction that our approach relies on inducing a theory in some logic of formulae with an interpretation on association rules. For a formal definition of the semantics of association rules, the reader is referred to [1 A family of non-monotonic logic formalisms for defeasible reasoning on incomplete knowledge with a well defined sceptical reasoning process has been defined [3]. A defeasible logic theory is a collection of rules, formed upon a set of atoms as a body and an atom as a head, that allows the reasoning on sets of given facts. In defeasible logic, the rules constituting a theory represent assertions whose truth is indisputable, and assertions whose truth is problematic. As a consequence, two sorts of conclusions are obtained from the reasoning process indisputable or defeasible More formally, a defeasible logic theory is composed of a set of strict rules \(rules that are indisputably true rules \(rules whose application is considered problematic defeaters \(counter-arguments to defeasible conclusions superiority relation among rules \(as a disambiguation mechanism It was shown that the problem of deciding if an atom is a member of the extension of a defeasible theory can be efficiently implemented since it demands linear time and space 22]. Besides, it has been shown that the absence of a superiority relation does not compromise the expressive power of defeasible logic [4]. Within our approach, thus, we are interested in defeasible rules and defeaters only, and, since our targets for reasoning are association rules, we incorporate a notion of threshold covering to the reasoning process; if an association rule is concluded with some threshold values for support and confidence, the same association is concluded for any smaller value down to 0, provided there is no defeater for the rule with a value in-between In the example above, the association rule 3 \(A ? I 


concluded upon the association rule 6 \(AC ? I confidence and ? 0.05 as support, according to the "defeasible rule" pattern encountered in the example. Thus, A ? I is also implicitly support. However, if a defeater for rule A ? I is simultaneously asserted with ? 0.04 the A ? I would not be concluded with ? 0.5 as confidence and ? 0.03 as support. This choice is important for a better understanding of the theories obtained. Within our approach, we consider defeasible rules that allow us to conclude that an association rule defeasibly holds, with independence of the conformance with given support and confidence thresholds, provided that other association rules also hold conforming the thresholds Defeaters are included here to prevent the erroneous conclusion of an association not conforming the given thresholds A. Logic for Associations We want to represent the set of all given association rules among itemsets through a defeasible theory. Thus, the domain on which formulae in our logic are built is founded structurally on the set of all itemsets formed upon the set of items involved with exception of the null itemset. This way, terms in our logic constants and variables number of items DEFINITION 1: \(Itemset Term term is a construct of any of the forms i1 in, a ground itemset term, where i1in is a nonempty list of items Vm,M, a variable itemset term, where Vm,M is an itemset variable, 0 ? m ? M. The pair m, M indicates the class of itemsets involved  with size between m and M .When the pair is absent, the pair \(0 t1 ?  ? tn, a itemset union term, where t1 ,, tm is a non-empty list of itemset terms, and ? is an itemset infix function name with set union as fixed interpretation. t1 ?  ? tn implies that all ti, i=1..n, are mutually disjoint DEFINITION 2: \(Association a is an atom of the form a: S where \( _ itemset terms \(that fill the _ positions Ant\(a a 


consequent of a Association predicates are parametric. The pair  parameters: ? the support threshold, and ? the confidence threshold. Both parameters must be rational numbers. This way, there would be as many association predicates \(countable infinite  logic. An association S the atom S ? T ? holds Finally, we call a schema an association with at least one itemset variable DEFINITION 3: \(Assumption the form B  B the body of assumption association schemas with no arithmetic operators used in thresholds H the head of the assumption association schema, such that every variable appearing in H also appears in B An assumption is head-relevant if each atom in the body shares at least one non-ground term with the head or has a ground itemset term with a non-empty intersection with a ground itemset term in the head EXAMPLE 5: The following assumption ?1 corresponds to the meta-rule induced in Example 2 1:  X1,1 ? Y1,1 ?\(0.05, 0.6 0.05, 0.6 where X1,1, Y1,1and Z1,1are itemset variables of item-size = 1 Assumption ?1 is head-relevant DEFINITION 4: \(Defeater form d:  X ?\(s, p where X ? \(s,p association X ?\(s, p context of a proof system, a defeater has priority over conclusions obtained from the application of assumptions EXAMPLE 6: The defeater d1: A ?\(0.05,0.6 first counter-argument introduced in relation with Example 2 B. The Reasoning Framework In order to reason appropriately with programs made of associations, assumptions and defeaters, a non-monotone inference mechanism is presented, and theories are defined on 


it. Programs in this framework are inspired from [3], and can be translated in linear-time on the number of their ground instances into definite programs of clausal logic [4], with a linear-time ground inference procedure [15] on the same basis DEFINITION 5: \(Compaction Program program ? is a 3ary-tuple \(AR, Das, Dft associations, Das is a set of assumptions, and Dft is a set of defeaters DEFINITION 6: \(Closure  AR, Das Dft associations ?, recursively satisfying the following           and there exists an index k ? 1, such that ? [k] = S closure Cl AR, Das, Dft set AR+, where AR+ is the set of all ground associations derivable from program III. INDUCTIVE DEFEASIBLE COMPACTION In this section we present the main result of our paper: we present the notion of inductive defeasible compaction of a set of association rules and an algorithm for finding such compaction of a given set of discovered associations. The input is assumed a complete set of associations, with maximum values for confidence and support thresholds; no holding association rule should miss to be interpreted by an association atom in the input set, and, for all association atom in the input set, no association rule holds with support and confidence greater that the thresholds given in the atom DEFINITION 7: \(Inductive Defeasible Compaction constant k > 0 and a set of ground associations AR, complete for a given database D, a pair parameters, an inductive defeasible compaction of the set AR is a program ?: \(ARmin, Das, Dftmin

The Induction Algorithm A PTIME algorithm that computes a compaction of a complete set of ground associations by inducing a set Das, and producing appropriate sets ARmin and Dftmin for the induced set Das is presented in Fig. 1. We discuss here the underlying ideas, and details related with its correctness and time complexity The algorithm begins with a procedure, detailed in Fig. 2 that greedily tries to produce all ground head-relevant assumptions, increasing the possible body size, variable j in the algorithm, from 1 to k. Each association in AR is considered there the head of a potential ground assumption, and all groups with a body size that equals j are considered as potentially bodies, provided the union of the itemsets that appear in the antecedent and the consequent of all members of the group covers the union of the itemsets of the antecedent and the consequent of the selected head rule                   Figure 1.

              Figure 2.  Forests Derivation Next, the procedure proceeds to build, for each ground assumption, a set of forests of trees of itemset terms, with 1 one forest for the head, with one tree for the antecedent and one tree for the consequent; and 2 body, with a tree for the antecedent and consequent of each atom in the body. The leaves of the trees in the forests contain the subsets that are produced from the complete intersection of the prospective head of the assumption and the prospective bodies, considering the antecedent and the consequent of each rule separately Then, fresh variables are assigned to leaves; the forest becoming a structural representation of an assumption candidate for the set Das It is simple to see that the time complexity of the procedure detailed in Fig. 2 is O\(n k  The next step consists in finding isomorphisms among the forests, with the linear time algorithm of [2], leaving one assumption per isomorphic class in the set Das; the step demanding O\(m 2  all ground instances of each class on a list attached to the class in a manner that the substitutions applied to each variable can be deduced from them easily The algorithm proceeds next to find defeaters, the set Dftmin 


from the set of assumptions  forest classes -, applying them greedily to the given associations, according to the condition established in equation \(1 an atom to be defeated are then attached to the defeater with the substitutions applied. The method employed works satisfying the property iii in equation \(2 a minimal set of defeaters can always be obtained using the assumptions and the complete given set AR; the defeaters inferred from Das is independent of the level of pruning applied to AR, provided no information loss occurs in that pruning. This step takes O\(n k  An optimisation is attempted for set Das, with the reduction of the number of defeaters in Dftmin as a goal. The algorithm loops, trying to find the better set of assumptions, by successive adjustments. The substitutions applied to form ground assumptions are contrasted with the substitutions applied to form defeaters. Adjustments in variables sizes hitherto unlimited  and in thresholds of the assumptions are operated, producing if possible: 1 variables that exclude the size of variables of defeaters; 2 maximum of confidence and support thresholds for bodies in the assumptions that prevent the formation of one or more defeaters. It is easy to see that the step is polynomial in the size of set AR The pruning of AR is then accomplished. A candidate for pruning results any association that appears as head of a ground instance of an assumption in Das \(recall they were attached to assumptions in step one have cycles, cycles are identified and broken by eliminating one node of each cycle. An elimination order is therefore produced, by a systematic remove of ears in the graph considering only nodes candidate for pruning. Associations are then pruned from AR in the elimination order, forming the set ARmin. Note that this technique ensures properties i and iii to hold for set ARmin. Finding cycles in a graph, the hard part of this step is known to have a polynomial time complexity in the number of nodes, so it is this step in the number of given associations, since the nodes in the graph are the associations themselves Finally, the test: #ARmin + #Dftmin + #{atoms 


AR is made. If the answer is positive the algorithm ends successfully  the program returned satisfying property ii \(in addition to i and iii among those contributing in producing a defeater is chosen for elimination \(the most employed when producing defeaters is chosen first new set Das. If there are no assumptions to prune, the algorithm ends with failure. This step has constant time provided the sizes has been stored, and the number of loops, if they resulted necessary, cannot exceed O\(n k  IV.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
