1. Introduction  
The United States spends more than $2.3 trillion per year in healthcare and is the second largest nation just below Marshall Island\as  not translated into quality of care. As many as 98,000 people die annually in hospital because of medical  o reover, there is a significant gap between the healthcare we could have and the health care that is 
  
currently available in the Un response to this situation, The Institute of Medicine proposes several recommendations to increase the quality of care. One of the highly sought areas is the usage of business intelligence and big data analytics BI&A present evidence at the point of care, i.e., the practice of evidence based medicine \(EBM this study, we refer to EBM as the çconscientious explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patient  m eans affirm ing the individual clinical 
expertise with the best av ailable external clinical evidence. The best external clinical evidence can be drawn from the literature, and/or through the practice based knowledge. Each year, a significant number of research studies \(potentially serving as evidence reported in the literature at an ever-increasing rate outpacing the translation of these research findings into practice. Coupled with the proliferation electronic health records, and consum er health information researchers and practitioners are challenged to leverage the full potential of EBM The proliferation of potential evidence, patient data 
and health consumer information represent opportunities for the innovative applications of analytics techniques to assist with the translation of data \(in a variety of format depending on the source consumable knowledge. In this study, we refer to analytics as the çsystematic usage of data and related business insights developed through the applied analytical disciplines statistical, contextual quantitative, predictive, and cognitive fact-based decision making for management measurement, learning and pl anning. Analytics can be predictive, descriptive 
 The objective of this study is to explore the opportunities for leveraging business intelligence and big data analytics for evidence-based medicine. This is accomplished by conducting a systematic review of peer-reviewed journal by searching PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE, ACM, ABI/Inform and EBSCOhost using the keywordsÑ\(Evidence Based Medicine AND \(Computer OR Information Technology OR Information System OR Big Data OR Analytics OR Data Mining applications of analytics in EBM. We also performed a Google scholar search to scan 
important articles related to big data analytics in EBM.  We included 69 articles in final analysis. This research draws from that systematic review, and highlights existing gaps and opportunities for addressing these gaps by applying analytics techniques along th e different steps involved in EBM.  The analysis is designed to respond to the requirements and limitation of existing approaches in EBM The paper is organized as follows: the next section further describes business intelligence and big data analytics in the context of this study. Next, we illustrate the process of Evidence Based Medicine

followed by a research agenda for leveraging business intelligence and big data analytics in EBM. The paper concludes with a set of examples of research projects emanating from the research agenda and a brief discussion of challenges and prospects of BI&A in EBM  Evidence based medicine \(EBM conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of  is the intersection of individual clinical expertise, external evidence, and value to the patient. Evidence can be generated from both extant medical literature and practice-based evidence. Literature sources include randomizedcontrolled trials \(RCT\atic reviews, clinical guidelines, cohort studies, Qu asi-Experimental studies  other hand, practice-based evidences are generated from the day-to-day data collected in the hospital through treating the patients \(electronic health record Additional sources of practice-based evidence include claims data, insurance, and other administrative hospital data  According to Bloomberg, çAmong advanced economies, the U.S. spends the most on health care on a relative cost basis with the worst outcomeé, ranking 46 th among Bloomberg list of th e most efficient health  This is far behind the comparable developed countries like Hong Kong \(efficiency= 92.6\ and Singapore efficiency= 81.9 o reover, the N a tional H ealth Expenditureês \(NHE to persistently degrade in  2021 NHE projected \(a grow an average of 5.7% per year \(b GDP to increased from 17.9 %  to 19.6% \(c\edicare Spending to grow in average of 6.1% per year \(d Medicaid spending is estimated to grow an average of 8.2 % per year.  Most importantly, in 2007, 62.1% of bankruptcies filers claimed high medical expenses; and a study done in 2013 showed that 25% of senior citizen who filed bankruptcy indicates the healthcare cost as  problem in United States and if something is not done healthcare is likely to hamper the overall countryês economy and the quality of life of its citizens In that regard, there is a significant interest in EBM by various stakeholders \(e.g. federal organizations, researchers and practitioners mechanism to reduce cost and improve quality of care In principal, EBM will assist in identifying what works for individual patients and in identifying the most suitable intervention. Moreover, there are also evidence that the practice of EBM will results in cost saving. For example, Neubauer et al. showed that use of EBM for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer NSCLC   various ways for how EBM can result in reduced healthcare cost including: 1\ results in a decrease in overall therapy. That is, physician can confidently recommend the most effective therapy as the first line of treatment, which eliminates many unfruitful or detrimental interventions; 2\BM can reduce the cost by prescribing less expensive Drugs or/and Intervention.  For example if evidence points to two probable therapies with simila r benefits and risks, but largely varies in cost; than, physician recommends less expensive therapies; 3\ can reduce the number of hospital visit by allowing physicians to minimize the adverse side effect of drugs or therapies. Other important cost saving thr ough the EBM includes: cost saving by preventing or predicting the diseases condition, cost saving by e fficient chronic care, and cost saving by reducing the adverse drug effects etc  Generally, evidence based medicine consists of 7 steps \(Table 1 The first step in EBM is to ad equately understand patientês clinical problem. An exam ple of patientês condition may beÑ48 years old, 200 pounds, white male, with high blood pressure \(BP\ that is newly diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes. Other relevant information includes: aller gy condition; kidney, foot and eye health; cardio-vascular diseases etc. The patientês condition can be understood by the past and present diagnosis, laboratory, and administrative data After the patientês condition is identifie d, this step proceeds with synthesizing those condition in to clinical questions. An example of a clinical question may be: Is nutritional therapy as affective as Oral Medication to the 48 years old T2 Diabetes patients with overweight, and high BP?  Then, clinical questions are converted into EBM question. One of the ways to structure the EBM question is through the Population-InterventionComparison-Outcome \(PICO\ criteria. PICO is getting significant attention as a means to compare the economic, social and clinical outcome of different intervention alternatives [14

 TABLE 1: The EBM Process 
the demographic and clinical information of patient intervention refers to the possible course of action while comparison refers to comparing between alternative interventions, or between çintervention and çno interventioné; finally, outcome means output which we want to access \(clinical, economic or social An example of EBM question may be Age: 48; Wt: 200pounds; BP high; A1C:7%; Allergy: NSAIDs Nutritional Therapy Oral Medication Glucose Control In general, the medical question on hand can refer to diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, iatrogenic harm quality of care, or health econom This step focuses on extracting the information related to the EBM question This step also includes preliminary evaluation of relevant information \(individual article, or individual piece of information from electronic health record before it is used for further analysis. For example, if an article does not satisfy the minimum criteria, then it should be discarded. The information is analyzed synthesized, and translated into consumable module that solve the EBM question. The sources of evidence could be electronic health record \(Practice-Based Literature-Based Evidence The practice guidelines that are generated in previous step are further curated in this step. Medical field is information critical domainÑcorrect info rmation assist to make correct decision and save life; however, faulty information may invite death or complicates the patientês condition. As a result, clinicians are reluctant to trust a computer progr am that display evidence without clear information about reliability and  and practitioners must adequately evaluate the evidence and maintain confidence in evidence Evidence evaluation can be done in three steps: grade the individual articles, or individual piece of information; grade the overall evidence \(after aggregating the individual piece of information calculate the statistical significance of overall information. The output of evidence evaluation is the pvalue Here, the focus is on converting critically appraised evidence into consumable guidelines preferably in mach ine readable format, e.g evidence coded into the UMLS, or evidence coded in   Regarding the evidence presentation, literature points  esent the EBM at the point of care; present at least 2 alternatives course of actions show reliability and citati on along with the evidence fit information in a single screen of a computer This step assesses if stakeholders are actually getting benefit by practicing EBM. Not only this, it also helps to know which evidence is working, and what are the improvements needed in the knowledge base of EBM. When technology is used to deliver EBM, this step becomes easier by automating the evaluation task  
1- Identification of Patient Condition Identify overall patientês condition by analyzing past and present health records. This may include demographics, allergies, symptoms, diagnosis, tests economic status, past condition, family history for hereditar y and other related information 2- Formulate the EBM Question Synthesize the clinical question into EBM question One of the most common ways of generating the EBM question is through the PICO criteria \(Popula tion, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome 3- Evidence Generation and Analysis Generate evidence by combining the information fr om the research studies \(literature, RCT, Clinical Hospital Information Systems/ Electronic Health record\ Here practice-based evidence refers to evidence generated fr om the day-to-day practice in clinical setting 4- Evidence Evaluation Grade individual pieces of information \(individual artic le, or individual information from practice based evidence Calculate the statistical significance of collective evidence 5- Converting Evidence into Consumable Unit Convert critically appraised evidence into easily accessible & usable format 6- Evidence Presentation and Use Present  at least 2 alternatives course of actions at the point of care Show reliability and citation along with the evidence 7- Evaluation of Implementing EBM into Practice Track the success/failure of each piece of information Update the statistical significant/rating of evidence accordingly Calculate the long-term effect of using EBM

With the proliferation of data, business intelligence and big data analytics has emerged as an important study for both practitioners and researchers, regardless of domain. Chen et al  techniques, technologies systems, practices methodologies, and applicati ons that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better understand its business and market and make timely business decisionsé. Examples of emerging issues in BI&A include Big Data Analytics, Text Analytics, Web Analytics, Network Analyti cs, and Mobile Analytics  e of the im portant applications of analytics in the literature in the context of evidence based medicine are \(a\utomate the article selection procedure in systematic review b the abstract of article in PICO \(population intervention, comparison and outcome c  d mine the electronic health record and identify the  e guidelines into computer ex  f grade the evidence  and calculate the statistical  g i ne the health records and identify the optimum h identify the association rules in the electronic health  valuable, still lags behind other domains, such as ecommerce. This may be attributed to the notion that healthcare researchers are relatively new to the field or has rarely taken advantage of scalable computational platform or analytical met  demonstrate that the potential exist for researchers and practitioners to employ BI&A in healthcare specifically the practice of EBM and as a mechanism to provide a new venue to reduce the cost and improve the quality of healthcare   This section illustrates how BI&A can be applied to support various Evidence Based Medicine processes described in Table 1. Each sub-section describes pertinent examples from the literature, identifies research gaps, and lists examples of research issues for leveraging BI&A in EBM as outlined in Table 2  Extant literature suggests that EBM should be fully integrated with electronic h ealth record \(EHR\s  keywordês of EHR with pertinent literature is done \(for example, matching diseases condition with Metathesaurus of article  d a prototype system that explores the opportunity to automatically extract patientês problems from the teamês notes and query evidence resources available in literature. They used the National Library of Medicine \(NLM\etaMap service to identify relevant Unified Medical Language System \(UMLS aurus concepts in the patientês electronic medical record \(EMR those terms to query resources. The problem with their system isÑidentifying only the UMLS terms in the patientês EMR does not provide a complete picture of patientês condition, e.g demographic information duration of problems, etc. I ndeed, if a researcher wants to realize adoptable EBM, more work should be doneÑEBM systems must automatically mine patientês past and present health record and assist in identifying the overall clinical condition. Examples include demographics, allergies, symptoms, diagnosis tests, economic status, past condition and family history for hereditary essence, there is a limited capability for automatically extracting patients information from EHR fo r identifying a patientês  In order to automatically identify patientês condition, a system should use a combination of analytics techniques. Applyi ng data analytics will be facilitated if the electronic health record is in a standardized format, e.g., CDA, SNOMED, and LONIC. Otherwise ad-hoc processes may be required Data mining and Text anal ytics techniques such as information retrieval and information extraction can be applied to EHR. Ad-hoc techniques to mine the unstructured physician notes can also be employed  Currently, clinicians have to manually translate patientês condition into an EBM question following the Population-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome \(PICO criteria. However, this is very time consuming and inefficient. For example, th e average hospital visit in United States in primary care setting takes 20.8 minutes; with less than 10 minutes for more than 20  u ring a visit, it is alm o st

impossible for the physician to conduct the additional work needed to adequately formulate the clinical question, to generate the search query, and to execute those queries against an evidence-base. There must be a better way Fortunately with r ecent developments in technology, patientês condition can be automatically synthesized into  PICO criteria.  One of the key techniques in synthesizing c linical question into PICO criteria is Topic ModelingÑit uncovers the hidden thematic structure in doc ument collection. Topicmodeling assist in creating new methods to browse search and summarize large archives of text into structured format \(based on topic After the clinical questions are structured into the PICO criteria, it is possible to automatically create the search query; moreover, search query must be slightly customized based on the underlying technology Vendor of EMR system, da tabase system, analytics tools and other\ also allows clinician to alter the clinical questions, or generate the clinical question manually  There is a need for being able to generate usable information from existing litera ture as well as the everincreasing repository of information in electronic health records. For example, as of May 2013, over 145 thousand clinical trials are registered in clinicaltrial.gové alone; moreover, there is a huge number of clinical guidelines, cohort studies, expert opinions, and other evidence sources. On the other hand, as the healthcare is moving into electronic format, large amounts of data is being produced and stored in EHR systems on a daily basis. In that regard IBM W to generate evidence by retrospective analysis of existing data as well as data from perspective studies IBM partnered with Wellpoint and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \(MSKCC commercial applications for Watson in Healthcare. At MSKCC, Watson will be trained about the Oncology so that it can help with diagnostic and decisions in cancer. IBM Watson is incredible example of application of BI&A for EBM; However, it is still in the research phase, and many more research and business issues should be figure it out before it is delivered into the marke t. Another example from  text mining based pipelini ng framework that supported the creation and updating of evidence reports that provide assistance for the literature collection collation, and triage steps of the systematic review process.  Their system has four components: \(a search engine; \(b\classifies article based in RCT, cohort studies etc. \(c the articles publicationês relatedness \(d component ranks the classified and grouped articles based on likelihood of inclusion in systematic review The proposed approach automates some aspects of the systematic review process. Other examples include  these studies do not yet realize the full potential enab led by an ever-increasing evidence base Big data analytics enables all the data \(medical literature, electronic health record, clinical notes, x-ray and other imaging data, insurance and claims data, and more\translate data to relevant information for EBM search Engine provides the mechanism to search all the available resources \(e.g., PubMed and Cochrane translating user queries into the respective query  Search System provides the capabilities for searching and retrieving any number of unstructured and structured data sources w ithin a organization by single  application of various analytics technologies semantic web technology, text analytics, statistical machine learning and others.

 Topic linking can be used to link all the patients in an EHR who have a particular combination of related conditions, e.g., gout and have allergy of NSAIDs  Despite of strong guidelines and recommendation there is no adequate mechanism for evaluating the evidence. For example, W criteria for rating evidence: \(a\aggregate rating of individual studies \(b\number of studies, sample size, and effect magnitude \(c consistencyÑfor any topic, the extent to which different studies reported similar findings. While the study demonstrates the viability of the criteria in evaluating relevant evidence, it is not scalable given the sheer volume of medical knowledge/evidence There is a need to automate the application of these criteria to the the literature and practice based information BI&A techniques may be used to rate the individual articles as well as the overall evidence. The individual piece of information can be rated based on the study question, popula tion, randomization blinding, intervention, and  researcher can use text analytics and natural language processing to identify if the articles satisfy the criteria given by AHRQ and rate the individual articles  Recommendation and guidelines for computer based EBM highly encouraged generating the final evidence in computer interpre  Surprisingly, we found none of the EBM systems in literature satisfying this requirement.

In anot her example, Sim et al  trial.  These techniques help to understand the fundamental ideas; however, there is yet a need to be able to analyze incomplete, highly unstructured guidelines; and accurately convert into computer readable format. One approach is to use a combination of advanced analytics techniques \(entity extraction topic modeling, clustering, semantic web and statistical machine learni ng practice guidelines into standard Medical Ontology The exact identification of biomedical and clinical terms, and matching to standard ontology is very  essence, term identification  string as possible term; 2 assify the term \(diseases drug, body part, physiological function the term to a standardized medical ontology. For an example, one can use a combination of analytics techniques to mine the practice guidelines generated by computer, and those practice guidelines can be represented into UMLS format. According to NLM UMLS integrates and distributes key terminology classification and coding st andards, and associated resources to promote creation of more effective and interoperable biomedical information systems and services, including electronic health records  Moreover, future research can further explore adequacy of various techniques in accurately modeling incomplete practice guidelines into computer readable format    The final task of EBM systems, namely EBM presentation, is to ensure th at the right information gets to the right person, at the right place, at the right time  Any information delivered should have metadata related to provenance, reliability and quality of the delivered information.  It is also important that the information presented should be concise, and if possible, should fit in a single screen  o w ever, m ajority of the EBM system s in the literature have not considered all these factors EBM data visualization techniques present the economic, clinical, and social outcome of different treatment alternatives in the form of text. Physicians do not have time to read extensive documentation. Better way must be found! Thi nking out of the box, and moving further from the traditional healthcare data visualization; it is time for researchers and practitioners to adopt recent developments in areas such as visual analytics, e.g., SAS Visual An i sual Analytics present big data in an interactive graph and chart in a way that is not overwhelming. For an example, in spite of pres enting the economic, clinical and diseases progression of different treatment alternatives in the form of text in three different screens; visual analytics can present all the information in single screen in the form of chart, or graph

However, existing literature have performed only limited task of evaluation. For  ated that EBM for Cardiac condition \(Cardiac Decisi on Support physician time for getting relevant information.

The TRIDENT vehicle  concurrent engineering facility, Team X, and was driven by both science and trajectory requirements We assumed current technology levels for all subsystem components despite the 2029 launch date, since the goal of the Planetary Science Summer School was to understand what type of  technology During the Team X sessions we identified several key system trades that ultimately drove the spacecraft design The navigation trades were presented in Section 3 and trades regarding risk, reliability, and cost will be discussed in Section 5 The spacecraft design specific tr ades were related to 1 power 2 attitude control 3 telecommunication, and 4\ configuration, and are presented in Table 6  Table 6. Key Technical Trades Subsystem  Trade  Decision  Impact  Power  ASRG vs RTG vs Solar  ASRG  Dual fault tolerant power system, lifetime issues  A C S  Reaction wheels vs Propellant  Reaction wheels  No scan platform, high pointing capability  Antenna  Gimballed vs. Fixed  Gimball ed  Flexibility in operations  Config   Scan vs Fixed Pla tform  Fixed  Simpler design more stringent pointing requirements   We recognized from these trades that lifetime was ultimately the limiting factor since it significantly affects the power attitude control and propulsion subsystem requirements. In this section, we begin with an overview of the TRIDENT spacecraft and the key components. We then provide a breakdown of each subsystem and the key design considerations for each of them Finally we also offer a breakdown of the mass and power requirements for the system

It demonstrates the spacecraft provides sufficient power including contingency throughout the entirety of the mission In the case of a single ASRG failure the system will rely on supplementary battery power during the radio occultation mode to meet spacecraft requirements The battery capacity is sufficient for the short duration of discharge \(4 hours Communications  We designed the communications system to be a dual-frequency system, with full redundancy and flight-proven hardware The four primary performance requirements were 1 two-way link with Earth through all mission phases 2 6 kbps data rate at 30 AU on Ka-band between the spacecraft and a 34 m beam waveguide \(BWG ground station, 3\ X-band occultation capability at Neptune and 4\ flyby spacecraft reception of probe data at 2 kbps on S-band from a range of 15,000 km Additionally we required that the command Bit Error Rate BER be 1e5 and that the telemetry frame error rate FER be 1e-4 Finally we set minimum link margins of 3 dB for all data terminal equipment \(DTE\ and 6 dB for all relays Table 9  details the flight hardware for the communications system The total system mass is 70.6 kg.

A 70 m antenna will be used for Neptune encounter and flyby tracking.

    13  software architecture where each component is an individual system and these smaller systems work together as a unified C&DH subsystem Thus each element determines its own data requirements such as compression ratio, and the C&DH and software systems handle the overall data accumulation and handling Subsystem responsibilities include 1 telemetry collection analysis 2 command processing 3 data management and 4 subsystem and instrument data collection and processing. We chose a dualstring RAD750 64  f o r  th e ce n tr al p r o ce s s in g  u n it  C P U   The C&DH subsystem is capable of 32 Gbits of RAM, and 1.6 Tbits of non-volatile RAM. This is more than sufficient storage for the 21 Gbits generated by the science instruments  Configuration  Figure 5 shows a CAD rendering of the \(a fully deployed and b Atlas V 551 fairing-configured TRIDENT spacecraft The principal components and their locations within the vehicle are also detailed The primary design considerations were instrument location fairing diameter, and propellant tank size. TRIDENT possesses two different deployment mechanisms one for the magnetometer boom and one for the probe No scan platform was included in the configuration design Therefore the imaging instruments require attitude control maneuvers during operations In order to limit the severity and frequency of these maneuvers we imposed a common look-direction requirement for the NIR spectrometer UV spectrometer and NAC which is the Y face of the spacecraft Doppler imager operation occurs 1 month prior to the encounter phase and its location was thus less strictly constrained The plasma spectrometers are located in the 255 45 260  X direction The magnetometer and its 10 m boom which do not have requirements on their position, extend in the +Y face, primarily to prevent obstruction or interference with the HGA or instrument suite Attitude Control System ACS  The ACS is three-axis controlled and we provide its specifications in Table 11 The  high pointing demands of flyby science especially due to conflicting requirements between the Doppler imager and NAC The Doppler imager science requires a very stable platform while rapid slew rates are necessary for the NAC science. The success of the encounter is therefore dependent on the performance of the ACS We designed the ACS to with full redundancy and fine control capabilities in order to meet the science requirements. The primary limitation of the ACS is the slew rate of the spacecraft Using reaction wheels a slew rate of 2.4 mrad/s is possible This rate enables the NAC to be continually positioned at the target until just before closest approach and again during the departure. During the approximately three minutes of closest approach the slew rates will be insufficient for the NAC to capture high quality images of the targets However the science goals do not depend on imaging with the NAC during those periods. Lastly, we note that even in the absence of reaction wheel control thruster pointing is sufficient to achieve full threshold science The thrusters alone would enable a similar slew rate to the reaction wheels during closest approach however the pointing stability during the acquisition of the Doppler imager science without reaction wheels will be limited to less than ideal conditions Therefore to obtain reliable Doppler science and achieve all the baseline science objectives, the reaction wheels are necessary Table 11 ACS Capabilities  Capability  Specification  Po inting Control  0.2 rad  Pointing Knowledge  0.1 rad  Axis Stability  5 rad/s   Thermal System  The thermal environment for the TRIDENT spacecraft is similar to several other spacecraft designed for deep space activity. During cruise, TRIDENT will experience low ambient temperatures throughout the trajectory Consequently we utilize a 10 W pumped fluid loop system to redistribute waste heat from the GPHSs in the ASRG systems and from other heat dissipating components to maintain operating temperatures of the entire spacecraft Additionally twelve Lightweight Radioisotope Heater Units LWRHUs are used to maintain operating temperatures of the spacecraft thrusters providing approximately 11W of power Finally the spacecraft also possess ten layers of Multi-Layer Insulation MLI to prevent heat dissipation In the hot case when the spacecraft is in the inner solar system waste heat is rejected by means of an external 0.75 m 2  passive radiator which is shown in Figure 5  MLI also prevents excessiv e heating from the Sun In the case of an ASRG failure the temperature of the GPHS used to provide heat to these nuclear power components would increase 56   Ho w ev er   th e  p u m p e d  fluid loop system was designed to effectively redistribute this excess heat for up to two ASRG failures. The fluid loop system was also designed with a redundant loop in case of failure. Excess heat from the GPHSs can also be dissipated from the spacecraft by the radiator via the fluid loop system Propulsion System  We designed a dual-mode hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide NTO propulsion system to meet  dual-mode high performance apogee thruster DM HiPAT 65  ca p ab le  o f  a 4 4 5  N o f  th r u s t w it h  a s p ec if ic i m p u ls e o f  329 s The main engine is augmented by twelve Aerojet hydrazine monopropellant engines MR-103G 66   w h ic h  are each capable of 0.9 N thrust The monopropellant engines are responsible for attitude control maneuvering  approximately 1620 m/s. The total propellant and pressurant needed to meet these requirements have a mass of 1184 kg and included 226 kg contingency for mass growth and reaction wheel de-scope 


    14  5  C OST AND M ANAGEMENT  An overview of the cost and risk management approach for the spacecraft lifecycle is presented in this section. We first provide a breakdown of the expected costs at each phase of the development followed by details of the risk mitigation strategy employed to ensure that the system survives the long travel times and the deep space environment Finally we discuss desc ope options for the spacecraft Cost Overview  Although we designed the TRIDENT mission to comply to the constraints imposed on New Frontiers missions, the cost cap for the mission was increased to FY2015 1.5B excluding launch vehicle costs\ to account for the inherent costs of flying a spacecraft to deep space We used the NASA Instrument Cost Model NICM database and parametric estimates based on heritage to estimate the instrument costs We estimated the system cost using JPL grassroots and parametric models Furthermore we used internal JPL labor rates to estimate the operations costs NASA inflation rates were used to compute cost values in 2015 dollars Table 12 provides an overview of the project costs broken down by phase and Table 13  presents the instrument cost estimates. As can be seen from these tables the spacecraft design falls well below the provided cost cap even with the significant reserve included Table 12 Mission Cost Summary Mission Phase  Reserv e    Cost  M$FY2015  Development \(A D  30  1103.1  Phase A  30  11.0  Phase B  30  99.3  Phase C/D  30  992.8  Operations \(E  15  240.3  Project Cost w/o LV  27  1343.5  Launch Vehicle \(LV  0  30.0  Total Project Cost  26  1373.7  Table 13  Su mmary of Instrument Costs Instrument  Cost \(M$FY2015  Probe  0.0  MAG  9.0  NAC  18.0  PS  11.4  UVS  14.0  NIR  28.0  Doppler  57.5  Total Cost  152.1   We made a few important assumptions in the costing process First as mentioned earlier we assumed that the Atlas V 551 launch vehicle was provided by the government at no cost, as detailed in the New Frontiers Announcement of Opportunity 2   C o n s eq u en tl y   w e o n l y  i n clu d ed  t h e  operations costs associated with the launch vehicle in the estimate for the launch vehicle cost. Furthermore, the probe was also provided as government-furnished equipment and its cost was also not included in the estimate However when calculating associated costs \(e.g. systems engineering costs we assumed that the probe cost 157M without reserves which was consistent with the Uranus probe presented in the 2013-2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey 1   Mo r eo v er   w e ad d ed  d ev elo p m en t p r o g r a m s  i n  the Phase A-D costs including 12 months of testing and 100M for the development of the Doppler imager and 100M for further ASRG lifetime testing Although we  assumed that the necessary plutonium isotopes would be available, the ASRGs were not assumed to be governmentfurnished equipment and their acquisition, costed at $215M was fully accounted for in the cost breakdown \(within Phase C/D\ provided in Table 12   Risk Mitigation We performed a thorough analysis of the risks affecting the mission to ensure that appropriate mitigations were in place  Overall, we identified five significant risks and discuss these in the rest of this section, in order of importance 1\ ASRG lifetime 2\ High activity flyby sequence 3\ Long mission duration 4\ Doppler imager 5\ Antenna gimbal failure ASRG Lifetime  As discussed in Section 3 ASRGs are currently only rated for a 17-year lifetime, specifically for 3 years in storage and a 14-year flight lifetime 56   d u e to  limitations associated with their moving parts Although lifetime tests are ongoing we assumed 2015 technology in the mission design Therefore we did not assume that ASRGs will most likely have significant heritage by the proposed 2029 launch date The trajectory used in this design has a time of flight to Neptune of 13 years, with the end of the mission scheduled 8 months after close encounter This means that the proposed mission will require the ASRGs to survive until 4 months before the end of their rated lifetime, assuming that there are no delays in schedule, which represents a significant risk To mitigate this risk we sized the spacecraft to carry five ASRGs and we performed a risk analysis to investigate the probability of mechanical failure occurring We found that there is a <10% probability of a single failure occurring, in which case all the baseline science could still be achieved We found that the probability of two ASRGs failing is 3 If such a dual failure occurred all the threshold science could still be achieved. As mentioned in the last section, we also added an additional $100M into the budget for further ASRG lifetime testing High activity flyby sequence  As detailed in the mission design section the flybys of Triton and Neptune have a short duration 2 Earth days compared to the rest of the mission During this short period a large number of activities must occur in perfect sequence in order to achieve

The main mitigation approach to avoid data loss is to have a dual string system where both ACS and CDS strings are on during approach. If a single failure occurs the system will automatically switch to the redundant system without going into safe mode or requiring operator intervention. Furthermore, we showed in Section 2 that the probe can address the top three science questions for this mission Consequently we designed the mission sequence to prioritize observation of the probe during descent There is also ample time to downlink all the data collected by the probe before the Neptune encounter occurs The key science questions can thus still be answered even if a malfunction occurs during the Neptune close approach Long mission duration  The total mission duration including the data downlink time after the close approach of Neptune, is nearly 15 years. This imposes lifetime survival requirements that are much longer than those of typical missions. To address this risk, we designed the spacecraft to be fully redundant and parts selection was commensurate with the mission duration The ACS and in particular the reaction wheels was especially sensitive to lifetime degradation failures We therefore added a spare reaction wheel to the design Additionally we found that the thrusters would provide sufficient control to achieve all of the threshold science in the case of a reaction wheel failure and we included enough spare propellant in the design to enable this Doppler imager  As we explained in Section 2 the Doppler imager is an instrument that has never been flown for planetary observation before The technology and measurement techniques must therefore be proven in the laboratory before the imager can be flown. We added twelve months to Phase A and $100M to the budget to enable this additional assessment and testing to take place Antenna gimbal failure  The proposed design includes a gimballed antenna in order to enable radio occultation measurements during the encounter. The gimbal is a moving part that presents a risk of mechanical failure However threshold science can still be exceeded and the complete set of data can be returned post-encounter in the event of a gimbal failure thus reducing the adverse effects of such a failure   De Scope Options Although the proposed design falls well below the FY2015 1.5B cost cap and includes significant margins and risk mitigation strategies such complex missions are always at risk of unforeseen cost overruns As the design develops mass and power overrun can also occur Consequently we present a list of de-scope options in Table 14 with options at each of the first three phases of the development process The primary de-scope option is the Doppler imager This instrument has a very high potential for incredible science return, but it is the single most expensive instrument in the chosen suite. The other de-scope options would simplify the proposed design while still enabling all the threshold science to be achieved Overall, we showed that this mission comes well below the cost cap even with significant margin We performed a thorough risk analysis we did not find any missionthreatening risks and we implemented several strategies to mitigate any potential adverse effects from the main perceived risks that were identified. Finally, we listed seven de scope options which together would cut up to 125M 160kg and 115W from the mission These potential descopes therefore provide several opportunities to simplify the design should the need arise while still achieving all the threshold science 6   C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we present the results of a study undertaken by 16 graduate and post-doctoral students during the 2013 Planetary Science Summer School We propose a low-cost mission concept to the Neptunian system called TRIDENT which can achieve a range of science goals with a budget of less than FY2015 $1.5B. Neptune and Triton are chosen as the target of this study because, together, they embody two fields of high scientific interest 1 ice giants and their similarities to exoplanets and 2 icy moons and their potential as astrobiology targets. Neptune and Triton among 


    16  the planetary bodies in our solar system that have the least amount of observational data and a mission such as TRIDENT would provide order of magnitude improvements on our current understanding of the Neptunian system We start the paper with a decomposition of the science goals for TRIDENT. We then show that we were unable to close on an orbital mission design due to significantly exceeding launch mass requirements, thus motivating the selection of a flyby trajectory. We follow these with in-depth descriptions of the subsystems and overall system designed We close the paper with details of the system cost risk mitigation strategies and de-scope options Although a mission to the Neptunian system is not feasible until the late 2020s due to trajectory constraints, we show that compelling science can be undertaken at this target under constrained budgets and urge that the study of this system be considered in future mission proposals A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The 2013 Planetary Science Summer School was held at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology, under government contract to NASA We would also like to thank members of the JPL education office specifically Trisha Steltzner and Leslie Lowes for coordinating the summer school.
