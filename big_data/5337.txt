      niasup 1ni1}asupminconf{maxasup  a i 1ii i  For example: we can see from Table 2, the support of [1 is 4/6, and the support of [1 **] is the greatest in the all items, so its MIS value is its own support 2/3. From this calculation, we can draw the support of various items and items among layers in Table 3 IV. APPLICATION EXAMPLE We use the form of a hierarchical structure to encode the user purchase information in table 1, express the value in the corresponding with the various items hierarchical encoded of the TID by information granulation, and calculate the support corresponding to each item encoded by the hierarchical structure, which are shown in table 2. Through the definition of multiple minimum supports based on Granular Computing and the minimum support derived form the various items calculated in Table 2,we can calculate minimum supports corresponding to each item and level-items and show  in Table 3 The entire mining process of multi-level association rules is start at the search of is high-level frequent itemsets. Each item has a minimum support by definition 2. Search the transaction data in table 2 to find the frequent itemsets which meet the minimum support in same layer and multiple layers, while record them in table 4. For example, we calculate the multiple minimum support of [1 **] and [2 **] is1 / 3, sup \([1 **] [2  111100 ? 100101 which meet the minimum support 1 / 3. therefore, [1 **] and [2 are combined as frequent itemset. To extract the frequent itemsets repeatedly, and filter the candidate itemsets which does not meet the minimum support. Finally all the frequent 2 


itemsets are shown in table 4. While no further increase in levels, the entire search process will end Then we find frequent 3 - itemsets from all the frequent 2 itemsets in table 4 which meet the multiple minimum support of definition 2, and filter out the candidate itemsets which does not meet. Repeatly extract the frequent 3  itemsets, until the entire search process is completed, the results is shown in table 5 The generation process of frequent itemsets of multi-level mining is as follows TABLE II.

CONCLUSIONS This paper presents a multi-level association rule mining method based on binary information granules operations and multiple minimum support constraint, with hierarchical encoding and binary granular computing of information granules operation to acquire frequent itemsets at intra level as well as inter level. We give a new definition of support and confidence based on binary information granules. And combined with the definition of multiple minimum supports we effectively restrained the generation search space of frequent itemsets, and found new rules implied in the scarce data items, achieved association rule mining of multi-layer including cross-layer. We got more meaningful rules, and avoided the generated useless rules from the high frequency data items. At last, the method is applied to mining agricultural information association rules, which has been proven to be effective and practical REFERENCES  1] Agrawal R, Imielinski T, Swami A.

of the proposed approach are described. A simulation dataset with 64 items and 10000 transactions were used in the experiments. The dataset followed the exponential distribution. The initial population size P is set at 50, the archive size is set at 30, the crossover rate pc is set at 0.8, and the mutation rate pm is set at 0.001. The parameter d of the crossover operator is set at 0.35 according to Herrera et al.s paper [14] and the set of minimum support values is {3 4%, , 13%}. The experiments were first made for demonstrating the evolution of the Pareto fronts by the proposed approach. The evolution of the Pareto fronts of chromosomes in the archive along with different generations by the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 1 From Fig. 1, we can observe that the solutions were distributed on the Pareto fronts and the final solutions after 500 generations were better than those in different generations. Besides, we can also found that the derived solutions on a Pareto front are trade-offs between the two objectives. It thus depends on the user preference to decide which solutions on a Pareto front are desired. The experiment was then made for comparing the final Pareto front of chromosomes in the archive of the proposed approach with the previous approach [2], and is shown in Fig. 2  250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 Suitability To tal N um be r o f L 1

Comparison results of final Pareto fronts between the proposed approach and the previous approach  From Fig. 2, it is easily to know that the Pareto front derived by using the proposed approach is better than the previous one.  From the experimental results, we thus can conclude that the proposed approach is not only effective in finding an appropriate set of solutions, but also can provide different options to users for further analysis VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS The SPEA2 adopted a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method to derive better Pareto solutions 25]. In this paper, we have utilized it to propose a more sophisticated multi-objective approach to find the appropriate sets of membership functions for fuzzy data mining. Two objective functions are used to find the Pareto front. They are minimizing the suitability of membership functions and maximizing the total number of large 1-itemsets respectively Experiments on a simulation dataset were also made to 


show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach is effective in finding an appropriate set of solutions. Further, the experiments also show that the proposed approach can derive better Pareto front than the previous one [2].

n-dimension data cube\( I1  I k Support=sup_count/total_count 2 3 4. Performance Analysis Example 2 Lets talk about a practical problem just like the status of sales. Assume that we will mine the association rules involved 4 dimension attributes of sales, the minsup=25%. First of all, using OLAP technology to build a 4-D data cube and the 4 dimension attributes are: time location, item, and supplier. For location dimension which contains area, country and so on, we choose province level We use brand level for item dimension, company level for supplier dimension. Time dimension can be divided as Q1 1-3 4-6 7-9 10-12 location\(P1,P2,L1,L2 York, item\(B1,B2,B3,B4 C1,C2,C3 sales data cube can be generalized like this Graphic 2: The 4-Dimension Data Cube of Sales The details of this sales data cube are in the table follow: The amount of cells is 100 Location Time Item Supplier Count Cell-1 P1 Q1 B1 C2 5 Cell-2 P1 Q3 B1 C1 2 Cell-99 L1 Q3 B1 C1 3 Cell-100 L2 Q4 B1 C3 11 Table 2: The details data table of sales data cube We use original Apriori_Cube Algorithm to find frequent predicate set with minsup_num= 25%*100=25 According the data table we calculate that sup_count of every member of dimension L is \(P1:8, P2:5, L1:1, L2:24 and also T, I, S. So there is the process Graphic 3: The processes of old algorithm As we know, through comparing with the minsup_num dimension location has no one frequent 1-predicate set, so that there have no frequent 4-predicate set in the output by the original algorithm. But users are interested in the Candidate 1-Predicate set L T I S P1 P2 L1 


L2 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 B1 B2 B3 B4 C1 C2 C3 Frequent 1-Predicate set T I S Q1 Q3 B2 B3 C1 C2 I1 I 2 C1              C2                 C3 2 12 1 3 5 1 6 2 12 8 11 Q 1  Q 2  Q 3  Q 4 P 1 P 2 L 1 L 2 Candidate 2-Predicate set Q1,B2},{Q1,B3 Q1,C1},{Q1,C2 Q3,B2},{Q3,B3

But this time, users require that different members from dimension item can exist at the same time So we redo this mining process by the improved Algorithm Graphic 4: The processes of improved algorithm At last, we got the frequent 4-predicate set which the users are interested in, and then can format the rules 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size 


of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.

But this time, users require that different 


members from dimension item can exist at the same time So we redo this mining process by the improved Algorithm Graphic 4: The processes of improved algorithm At last, we got the frequent 4-predicate set which the users are interested in, and then can format the rules 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.
