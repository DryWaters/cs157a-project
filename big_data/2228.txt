INTRODUCTION \n \nThe rapid growth of data volumes created, recorded and \nanalyzed is a byproduct of consumer electronics’ and \ntelecommunications’ adoption boom. Almost twenty years \nafter the state controlled analogue fixed and mobile \nnetworks we are now well into the age of crowd-funded \nbusiness models and tech gadgets capturing different angles \nof our everyday activities. Every page we visit, every \nproduct we show some interest to, our clicks on various \nlocations and even the way the mouse or finger moves on \nthe screen1 is captured, analyzed and fed back to improve \nthe performance of each online store or blog. The growing \ntrend of wearable electronics2 suggests that many aspects of \nour life from sleeping patterns to gestures, emotions and \nexercising will be available to analyze and experiment on. \nMass data on urban mobility from a number of different \nresources \(including fixed and mobile phone networks, \nsocial networks transport electronics, banking activities, \nvarious purchases etc reschedule meetings or more importantly help \n                                                           \n1 www.clicktale.com and www.crazyegg.com are both \nmouse move capturing analytics services helping to improve nthe layout quality of each webpage. \n2 Like Google Glass, Wakemate, Fitbit, Zeo Personal sleep \ncoach RunKeeper, MoodPanda, Klout and Apple iWatch \ncontrol the spread of diseases and manage the risks of \nphysical or terrorist threats.  \n \nAll these capabilities are still waiting to be proved in \npractice as the analytical capacity of existing hardware, \nsoftware as well as the predictive modeling methodologies \ncan often delay the system responses or provide outcomes \nwith an unconvincing accuracy due to noise or other \ninferences. To that end it is possible that ‘economic \nthinking’ can help disentangle the causal links in the data, \nidentify reverse loops and multicollinear regressors and \nimprove the existing computation algorithms to match the nspeed that data are created every second.     \n \nWe follow a simple approach and attempt to categorize big ndata as distinct information goods with unique \ncharacteristics. In this process we build a taxonomy, explain nthe main pricing features of big data, and document their \ntrading principles in online and cloud-based marketplaces. It \nis common to find two or multi-sided platforms for big data \nwhere producers \(generators right’s owners entities interested in the information structure or schema designers, equipment owners and \nmaintenance providers limits of use. We try to shed some light on \nthese challenges in ecosystem building on a common \neconomic framework.     \n \nThis paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we describe \nthe value of big data taxonomy as a market mechanism. In \nsection 3 we provide a simple framework for data trading \nunder uncertainty and competitive pricing.

BIG DATA TAXONOMY \nUnlike other goods and services information goods or \nsimply data belong to the broader class of experience goods: \na prospective buyer has less insight on the product itself \nthan the trader/owner and the later can – and often will [1] - \ntake advantage of this favorable condition.  \n \nBefore sketching the data taxonomy we first need to explain \nwhat data actually mean – in the big data context. This is \nperhaps easier through an example: a young man decides to \nupgrade his smartphone and starts searching on the web for nreviews, prices and personal experiences of other existing \nand prospective users. Profiling mechanisms in the search \nengines, cookies and sessions in each website, tracking from \n\(logged in status in networks and email providers all \ntogether capture his moves. More importantly price-\ncomparing platforms online auctions and mega stores often \nagree to share information with each other through a trusted \nthird party in order to – fairly – increase their revenues from \nthis activity 3 . He starts to see relevant content in the \ndesignated ad space of the places he visits even in a random \nforum, blog, video provider or newspaper website. Emails \nstart popping about sales in electronics and perhaps some \nholiday deals. For hours or even days later he still gets these \nupdates although he may have already purchased the phone.  \n \nAll these events happen because of real time, individual, \ngeocoded \(or simply big engines identify the product the young man is \nlooking for and match it to the list of suppliers that have nopted for paid advertisements. Then social networks and \nother websites get the organic feeds, combine them with \ntheir own information and subsequently start bombing their \ncustomer with suggestions, ‘liked’ products 


and offers. \nSometimes the algorithms appear to fail by a large margin \nand push messages for completely different goods. \nGradually consumer profiling improves and targeted \nmessages get a scarily high success rate. \n \nAll this data trading activity happens on the web and \ninvolves primarily private and often-sensitive data for \nindividuals combined with public and open data feeds. Key \naspects that define the types of data products or services in \nour taxonomy include intellectual property rights, licensing \nterms, and type of owner. \n \nA. Intellectual property rights, ownership and licensing \n \nData and databases can be legally governed under either \ncopyright or database right. Copyright only protects \nexpression, and applies to a database only when significant \ncreative effort has been put forth to organize the data or \npresent them Database rights, in contrast, protect a whole \n                                                           \n3 See Intent media \(intentmedia.com substantial effort has gone into the data collection. \nHowever, both copyright and database rights are difficult to \nenforce because of the difficulty of tracking paths of data \nstreams once the resource is made available. As with many \nother types of intellectual property, once data are out, they \nare out, and their destinations and uses cannot easily be \ndemonstrated. Such “leaky” intellectual property can be said \nto be nonrivalrous and partially exclusive, at the most [2]. \nRival goods such as cars can only be used by one party at a \ntime, whereas nonrival goods such as information can easily \nbe distributed and simultaneously used in many different \nlocations by many different people. For exclusive goods, \nproperty rights can be reasonably easily defined and \nenforced, whereas the opposite is true for nonexclusive \ngoods. Property rights may be defined and incompletely \nenforced for partially exclusive goods such as many \ninformation goods. \n \nAssuming that intellectual property rights \(other than simple \ntrade secrecy can be \nlicensed or simply made available without terms or \nrestrictions. Data goods can be owned by individuals, \nprivate parties \(e.g. commercial entities licensing terms, and ownership \ndetermine where data goods fall in our simple taxonomy. \nWe attempt to classify the different data origins in a \nstandard economic framework for goods’ classification. \nTable 1 draws three main categories of Big Data: private, \npublic and open data goods. Private goods are the classic ntype of an economic good where property rights are clear \nand held by a specific private party. Public goods are \nvaluable resources such as parks or clean air where someone \nmay or may not hold the property rights that are often rather \nvague. Such goods are often subject to the “tragedy of the \ncommons” [3] whereby they tend to be overused and not \ninvested in and maintained. The third category of data goods \nwe discuss here we call open data, which we define as \ncommon pool resources [4]. According to Ostrom, provided \na set of institutional requirements are met, collective action \ncan overcome the tragedy of the commons and maintain a nshared resource. In the case of nonrival information goods, \ncollective action can overcome a form of the tragedy of the \nanti-commons [5]. The tragedy of the anti-commons arises \nwhen multiple parties hold conflicting rights to a common \npool resource such as information with positive \nexternalities. If negotiation costs are significant due to the \nnumber of rights holders, a market failure results and the \nresource such as a technological breakthrough remains \nunderexploited.  \n \nIn the case of economic data goods, private data are created \nthrough a private application, website, device or service. \nThis information is generated by the users and owned by \none or more firms \(although individuals may sometimes \n39\nhave specific rights to the data about themselves the data either with layers of meta \ninformation, supplementing with publicly available \ngeocoding \(often through APIs users and usually stored for research and use \nby governments and local authorities, but commercial \nentities might also provide public data goods to support \ntheir proprietary resources or services. This type of ninformation includes data from public \(and free controlled \ntransport, electricity, gas, water information, income and \ncorporate tax reports etc. In the United States, due to the \nFreedom of Information Act, data collected by the \ngovernment belongs to the general public and hence by \ndefinition is a public good, whereas in most other countries, \ngovernments can actually claim property rights to the data \ncollected about citizens or organizations. This demonstrates \nhow any type of data can be offered as a private or public \ngood depending on the legal and institutional framework. \nWe define open data goods as accessible by everyone, \nalthough the terms of access may still limit the quantity, \nfrequency, uses, or monetary compensation for the data \ndepending on the type of user and type of use. General \nobservation suggests that open data are often patchy, \nunrepresentative, and non-tradable and they tend to lack \nconsistent structure. However this trend can quickly be \nreversed. Crowd sourcing attempts for open data platforms \nlike Lively \(former Pachube 


vendors, service innovators or governments to \nquickly share and connect their feeds in a flexible way. \nOpen data resources are collectively generated by private or \npublic \(governmental under \nrather general terms of use. For example, Open Data \nInitiative \(http://www.opendatainitiative.org an \nAustralian effort by a private company to increase \navailability of public \(governmental topics such \nas health, education, population, and transport. Similarly, \nthe World Bank has been a pioneer in creating and making \navailable open data, although these datasets are generally \nwell-structured, coherent and infrequent. More recent \nefforts are under way at the World Bank to pool less \nstructured and higher-frequency data as well \(cite plagued by anti-commons issues, because potentially \ncomplementary data sources are not available for valuable nanalyses due to the complexity and cost of negotiating rights \nand valuing \(pricing the main distinction between public and open data \ngoods is that property rights are not defined or enforced for \npublic data, whereas property rights are clearly defined and \nusage terms specified \(through licensing for open data, \neven if in many cases open data terms are stated very \nliberally \(but they still are licensed which means that \ndatabase rights are held by the owner of the data privately owned and controlled. \n \n\(Big Non-exclusive Partially \nexclusive \nRivalry Nonrival Nonrival Nonrival\nOwnership Private Public Private or npublic \nStatus Final Intermediate/Final Intermediate\nReach Global Global Global\nComplementarity Cross-dependent/\n\(sometimes Facebook, Google ncountries/ Independent for \nstate controlled regimes  \n-\nNecessity High Variable Variable/Low\nScarcity Non-free/\n\(sometimes nbase/Entire \npopulation with \nsynergies or \nmonopolies \nFull sample for client\nbase/Entire population \nwith synergies or \nmonopolies/Potential to \nimprove the Open data \nsphere with public data1 \nVariable Non nrepresentative \nsamples, \nomitted \nobservations, \nlack of \nconsistency \nCross-sections  \nGeography Coordinates  \nTime Time of day Day/Month/Year Time of Day\nGranularity Individual Individual Aggregate/\nIndividual  \n \nTable 1: Big Data classification from an economist’s view \n \nIn table 1 we also include typical cross sections in big data \n\(geography, time and granularity nfocus and dimensions of analysis achievable from each \nsample. \nIII. DATA TRADING \n \nAs all other intangible nwillingness to pay. Two economic factors significantly \ninfluence the pricing of data goods. First, as data are \nexperience goods, it is difficult to convince potential buyers \nof their value without actually showing the data. According \nto Arrow’s paradox, after information is revealed, its value \nis significantly reduced because of its nonrivalry and partial \nexcludability characteristics defined earlier. However, \ndatabases can be utilized in many ways and their value is \nperhaps not quite so critically influenced by Arrow’s \nparadox therefore the experience good challenge mainly \nconcerns the availability of “enough” descriptive \ninformation about the data, their structure, process of \ncollection, possibly “teasers” about the analyses or outputs nfrom the database. Besides, the volume of data produced in \nsearch engines and social media makes it almost impossible \nfor one or more users to monitor let alone document the \ngenerated information. The experience good restriction \nalmost collapses in light of these unique characteristics of \nbig data. \n \n40\nSecond, as information goods, data are often rather costly to \ninitially collect, and very cheap to copy or disseminate nTherefore, the fixed cost of constructing a database can be \nvery large, whereas the marginal cost of making copies of a \nsubset of the database is essentially zero. As a result, \n\(perfectly marginal-cost pricing \ncannot sustain the production and commercialization or such \ninformation products. With zero marginal cost, the price of \ncompetitive products would also be zero, and the supplier \nwould make a loss. Value-added \(and more excludable become profitable once a critical mass of data is \navailable. However, a potential “game changer” that limits nthe validity of the above arguments is the evolution of cloud \nservices coupled with process and service innovations for \ndata management and storage. There already are many cloud \napplications4 that help drastically reduce set up costs and \ncan be flexible in the pricing and storage needs as the \nbusinesses grow This ongoing trend that shifts the sunk \ncosts required for database collection, storage, and trading \ncan have a catalytic impact for small and medium \nbusinesses and is largely dependent on the quality of the naccess lines \(fixed or mobile connections information goods, producers need \nto position themselves in the market so as to generate some \ndegree of market power, such as through product \ndifferentiation. This implies that the producer can attempt to \nprice the \(hopefully unique 


data supplier indeed has some monopoly power due to \ndifferentiation, they can attempt to make a greater profit \nthrough price discrimination. This involves versioning the \nproduct, segmenting the market, or negotiating each sale \nseparately – offering personalized pricing. Each of these \ntactics is widely used in the digital economy. Versioning \nallows users with different needs and willingness to pay to \nself-select into product or service bundles of different \nquality levels, such as business and economy classes in air ntransport. Here, it is important to have a rather good idea of \nthe structure of demand, in order to be able to define the \nversions sufficiently distinctly so that revenues actually are \ngreater under versioning than under a single price. Market \nsegmentation, in contrast, requires that groups with different \ncharacteristics and thus willingness to pay can be clearly \nidentified and that they cannot sell the good to one another n\(carry out arbitrage professionals \ncannot pretend to be students \(vendors require student ID to professionals for a \nlower price than the professional price, a data supplier could \n n4 Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Storage, Dropbox, \nAero FS Justcloud, Livedrive and many others. \nmaximize profits by offering a lower-priced package for \nstudents \(the more price sensitive segment who are less price sensitive pricing requires very rich knowledge \nabout the characteristics of each customer based on which \nprice offers are being made. These characteristics could for \nexample be estimated from registration information and nclickstream. Whereas this is probably a more common \npractice than is known, there are notorious examples when \nprice personalization terribly backfired when customers \nfound out and were enraged. It is thus a riskier pricing \nstrategy that requires much information about users and \nconfidence that they implicitly accept these practices. \n \nIV. DATA INFORMED POLICY AND STRATEGY \nBuilding on Ostrom’s seminal contributions in the analysis \nof the role of collective action in resolving common pool \nresource problems [6][7], we propose that five of her design \nprinciples can be applied and adapted for open data markets. \nMost of these principles are clearly adopted in open-source \nsoftware communities, and to the degree that data \nmarketplaces attempt to create open platforms for data \nmodeling and collating, similar approaches will likely turn \nout to be valuable. \n1. “Clearly defined boundaries \(effective exclusion of \nexternal un-entitled parties means that it is \npossible to identify who is a legitimate user or \ncontributor and who is trespassing. Data platforms \nneed to set up clear and easy procedures for \nregistering and obtaining credentials to become \npart of the data user community. \n2. “Rules regarding the appropriation and provision of \ncommon resources that are adapted to local \nconditions.” It is important to specify how the data \nresources can be utilized offline or in other \npotentially unrelated applications. In particular, \ndata marketplaces must define whether and how nthe data can be subsequently commercialized. \n3. “Collective-choice arrangements that allow most \nresource appropriators to participate in the \ndecision-making process.” To maintain legitimacy \nof the marketplace contributing users must have \nways to participate in the development of the \nplatform. Otherwise, the platform provider risks \nalienating influential key members of the \ncommunity. \n4. “Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of \nor accountable to the appropriators.” Essentially, an \nopen data marketplace would need to be monitored \nby the group of core users, or by a third party \naccountable to the core users.  \n41\n5. “A scale of graduated sanctions for resource \nappropriators who violate community rules” and \n“mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap \nand of easy access.” Rules must define how the \ndata resources are to be utilized and if rules are not \nfollowed, what the penalties are. Any resulting \ndisputes will need to be handled reasonably quickly \nand efficiently. \n \nThese design principles seem simple and even obvious, but \nit is easy for an open data marketplace designer \(platform \nprovider nplatform and attempt to maximize control over the facility \nand activity. However, this is quickly likely to alienate \nimportant core users. In contrast, core users should be \nengaged in decision-making and develop clear rules, \npenalties, and conflict resolution mechanisms to maintain \nlegitimacy and full functioning of the community. \n \nV. CONCLUSION  \n \nThe constantly changing environment in the digital \neconomy has challenged traditional economic and business \nconcepts. Huge volumes of user-generated data are \ntransferred and analyzed within and across different sectors \ngradually increasing the markets’ dependency on precise \nand timely information services. A mere tweet from a \ntrusted source can cause losses or profits of billions USD \nand a chain reaction in the press, social networks and blogs5. \nThis situation makes information goods even more difficult \nto value as they have a catalytic impact on real-time \ndecision-making. “There is little doubt, at least in our own \nminds, that over the next decades “big data” will change the \nlandscape of economic policy and economic research” [8]. \n \nCategorizing these goods, assessing their quality and \nidentifying their impact is radically new in the field of \neconomics. The rate and scale of content generation \nmultiplies their impact 


and diminishes the time to respond. \nIn this paper we make a first attempt to build a taxonomy of \nbig data looking at three main clusters: private, public and \nopen data. We find that meta-information, consistency nrepresentativeness, copyrights, and limits of use are the \ncritical elements distinguishing these clusters In terms of \nthe market structure evolving around data trading and \npricing we note that traditional business models are \n                                                           \n5 The Associated Press Twitter account was compromised \non April 24th 2013 and reported the injury of President \nObama by an explosion in the White House. Although the \nAP quickly addressed the situation the event caused the loss \nof 130$ billion in stock values in a few seconds and the \nS&P declined by 0.9%. Big data analytics and high \nfrequency traders instantly responded to this tweet \nescalating the magnitude of this false alarm.   \nchallenged as almost zero set up costs can allow perfectly \ncompetitive markets with marginal-cost pricing to exist \nthrough a combination of value added services, product \ndifferentiation and market segmentation.    \nFinally we apply the common pool resources framework to \nidentify and describe the types of institutions that help \novercome the scarcity of valuable goods with significant \nexternalities \(tragedy of the anti-commons nit is essential to distinguish and engage the core user group \nin decision-making about the data platform Also, without \nclear rules about appropriate use of the resources, penalties \nof misuse, and mechanisms for conflict resolution are likely \nto be very important for the long-term success of open data \nmarkets. These design features can be found in successful \nR&D consortia, open-source software communities, and nstandard-setting organizations. Knowledge-creating \ncommunities can thus usefully be analyzed through the ncommon-pool resource framework. Indeed, knowledge \nresources, including big data assets, are common pool nresources fundamentally affected by externalities and \ncomplementarities among users and different uses, and to \noptimize the marketplace these need to be fully recognized \nand supported. \n  \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1 Brown, Jennifer, and Dylan B.

Observing that\nfrequent patterns have been widely recognized as important\ngraph characteristics we proposed a pattern-preserving graph\ngenerator \(PPGG target node number, degree distribution, and clustering\ncoef?cient, and the generated graph is guaranteed to contain\nthe frequent patterns with the required supports speci?ed by\nthe user. PPGG contains the two phases of Pattern Overlap-\nping and Graph Augmentation, and the experimental results\ndemonstrate that PPGG is ef?cient and able to generate a\nbillion-node graph in approximately 10 minutes. PPGG has\nalso been released as a free download.\nIt is expected that a massive graph usually has more\ndifferent kinds of frequent patterns than a smaller graph, under\nthe conditions of the same support. Therefore, a massive graph\ngenerated from PPGG may contain other frequent patterns not\nspeci?ed by the user. It is unrealistic for a graph generator\nto restrict the possibility that a generated graph can only\ncontain a set of given frequent patterns, because it will severely\nundermine the graph generation process to achieve the required\nstatistical parameters. Nonetheless it is reasonable for a user\nto specify a black list of frequent patterns that are not allowed\nto appear in a generated graph. Another way is to limit the\nnumber of unspeci?ed frequent patterns generated in a graph.\nOur future work will also explore this issue of undesirable\npatterns for PPGG.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work is supported in part by US NSF through grants\nCNS-1115234, DBI-0960443, and OISE-1129076, US De-\npartment of Army through grant W911NF-12-1-0066, and\nNational Science Council \(NSC 101-2628-E-001-003-MY3 Taiwan.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H.

The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
