  Abstract A decentralized fusion problem is a hypothesistesting problem where the decision algorithm is not provided with raw measurements but rather is provided only with results from so-called local decision functions.  In a serial decentralized fusion problem these local decisions are fused into a global decision one-by-one until all local decisions have been included or until a stopping criterion is achieved.  In this paper, we consider serial decision fusion with a single radar sensor using a local decision function based on the radar cross section \(RCS\characteristics 
measured across multiple dwells. In a single-sensor situation, the serial topology is convenient because local decisions are naturally sequential in time.  A serial topology also supports the calculation of system performance measures and adapts easily to a distributed or multi-sensor situation.  From dwell to dwell, measured RCS fluctuates due to noise, errors, and target scintillation.  By examining the results from multiple dwells, the measured RCS can be separated into fixed-amplitude and Rayleigh components The relative magnitudes of these components vary 
depending on both target type and sensor-to-target geometry.  Spreading measurem ents and local decisions in time allows the sensor to observe a moving target from different aspect angles and thus introduces changing geometry into the decision data.  In this way local decisions at different times are based on observations of different fixed to Rayleigh-amplitude ratios.  Results based on a high-fidelity radar simulation along with different fixedversus-Rayleigh RCS profiles are used to investigate issues related to serial multi-hypothe sis decentralized fusion Simulation results and performance measures demonstrating 
the efficacy of the proposed method are presented and sensitivities with respect to RCS profiles and to localdecision rates are investigated 1,2    1  1-4244-1488-1/08/$25 00 ©2008 IEEE   T ABLE OF C ONTENTS   1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  RCS  K APPA 2

Double-bound testing expands the twohypothesis detection problem into a three-hypothesis problem by introducing a hypothesis that exists in the region between signal present and signal absent   Thi s  three-hypothesis technique was later extended as a general multiple-hypothesis testing method for both the singlesensor[9 d m u lti-sen s o r[1 0  cases In this study, local decisions involve the selection of one of three hypothesis based on the measured properties of a radar target.

These measurements occur at a higher revisit rate compar ed to standard search and track maintenance rates.  Th e classification decisions at each periodic burst are treated as local decisions and are processed into a global classification using a serial approach.

At the conclusion of these sections, results are summarized and future work is identified 2  RCS  K APPA  By definition, radar cross section \(RCS\is the ratio of power per unit area reflected to ward a receiver divided by the power per unit area that wa s incident on the target.  A radar receiver does not directly measure RCS but can infer its value by calculating the ratio of the signal power received divided by the noise power \(SNR\The radarrange equation defines the re lationship between SNR and RCS.  Fluctuations in the target’s RCS certainly cause fluctuations in measured SNR; however, SNR fluctuations can also result from fluctuations in the environment transmit power, scan loss, beam-shape loss, and so on.  For the purpose of this section, assume that RCS fluctuations are the principal cause of SNR fluctuations.  In the Simulation Results” section we will relax this assumption and demonstrate what happens when other effects contribute to fluctuations in the SNR The RCS of a typical target is very sensitive to aspect angles i.e., roll, pitch and yaw\o frequency.  Relative motion between the radar and target induces RCS fluctuations both pulse-to-pulse and scan-to-scan due to the changing phase relationships between a target’s dominant scattering centers For different frequencies, a ch ange in the electrical distance between the dominant scattering centers induces RCS fluctuations even when the asp ect angles are held constant The exact nature of these fluctuations is difficult to model and even with real hardware measurements are typically not fully repeatable For these reasons, computer simulations of radar systems adopt various statistical models for RCS fluctuation.  The most common models are the so-called Swerling models Both Swerling type 0 and type 5 refer to a model with no RCS fluctuation.  Swerling types 1 and 2 model RCS fluctuations using an exponential distribution that assumes the target consists of many equal-amplitude scattering centers.  Swerling types 3 and 4 also use an exponential distribution but here the target is assumed to have one dominant scattering center along with many smaller equalamplitude scattering centers.  In types 1 and 3, the RCS fluctuations are relatively slow so that all pulses of the same frequency in a single dwell experience the same RCS.  In types 2 and 4, the RCS fluctuat es more rapidly so that each pulse in a single dwell experiences a different RCS From a modeling perspective, it would be convenient if a single Swerling type could account for the RCS fluctuations of a complex target over all frequencies and aspect angles As one might expect, this is only rarely the case.  From a discrimination perspective, it is important to realize that real targets often exhibit fluctuations with different statistics at different radar-target geometries.  One way to account for this change is to model the RCS using a more general distribution.  One good candidate is a Rician distribution because it is described by bot h fixed and fluctuating RCS parameters.  Indeed, specific ratios of parameters have been shown to produce results identical to the various Swirling cases.[11 Under the assumption of a generalized Rician RCS model part of the received signal can be attributed to a fixed RCS part can be attributed to a fluctuating RCS, and part can be attributed to noise.  In this case, the sum-channel in-phase and quadrature voltages for a monopulse radar receiver may be expressed as

In the Rician model, these observed values are presumed to be composed of contributions from three sources  the noise c 1  the fixed RCS, and c 2  the fluctuating RCS The observed SNR ratio R 0 is calculated from the sum channel voltages according to   2 2 2 2 0 2   012 012     RMS V  The expected value and varian ce of the SNR in terms of   and  can also be established.  This involves writing a pdf for the jointly Gaussian random variables s I and s Q  changing variables from s I and s Q to  and  integration over  and finally changing the variable  to R 0  The final result is a pdf for R 0 that can be used to write expressions for the expected value and variance.  These expressions are     1 2 1 1 1 2 0 2 2 2 2 0                  R F R R F VAR E   012  012   Here, the expected value for R 0 has been written so that contributions from the fixed and fluctuating parts can be easily identified.  The percent contribution from the fixed part  can now be expressed as the ratio of the fixed SNR to the total SNR.  The expression for  is R F F        A Method of Moments \(MM\ estimator can be used to obtain an estimate of  from samples or measurements of the SNR. Setting the equations for E  R 0  and VAR  R 0  equal to their corresponding sample moments yields equations for the MM estimates for R F and R R in the presence of noise.  From a set of observed SNR values estimates for R F and R R are obtained by N N F N N N R V Y N N V Y N N Y             2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1    where Y N is the mean and V N is the second moment given by        N k k N N i k N N V N Y 1 2 0 1 0 1 1 1   R 0k is the observed SNR at time k and N is the number of samples used in the estimate Measured RCS values can al so be used to estimate  The radar-range equation defines th e relationship between SNR and RCS.

This socalled classification mode is active for a short period of time after which the radar returns to normal operation.  The serial fusion process takes the set of periodic “local classifications and produces a fused classification.  This process implies two steps.  In the first, a set of raw measurements are used to decl are a local classification and in the second, multiple local classifications are fused In this study, each local cl assification is based on two inputs: the estimated mean RCS \(i.e Y n,RCS he estimated fixed RCS percent \(i.e  RCS  classified as either unknown or as a member of a class with known characteristics.  Since the target orientation is not known, the probability of belongi ng to a particular class conditioned on Y n,RCS and  RCS forms the basis of each local classification To support the conditional probability, the various densities e.g p\(Y n,RCS   RCS type ated using a histogram populated with noisy estimates of Y n,RCS and  RCS from each type under consideration.  To make it a little easier to keep things straight, two equally likely target types are identiefied as a reentry vehi cle \(RV\and a spent tank Fabricated data representing the true mean RCS and   versus aspect angle for the targets are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively.  To si mplify the problem, the targets are also assumed to be roll symmetric and further, exhibit no signature change with respect to relative polarization angles The conditional probability for each target type is calculated according to Bayes rule      RCS RCS N RCS RCS N RCS RCS N Y P type P type Y P Y type P                  Each local classification is based on two likelihood tests

Further, there is no “quality” data \(e.g., a probability input.  Finally both inputs are assumed to contribute equally to the new classification This leads to the following rules for making the global classification 1  If both inputs are the same, no change 2  If both inputs are different and neither is Unknown, the new global classification is Unknown 3  If one input is Unknown, the new global classification is equal to the known input In the case of two back-to-back errors, this simple strategy will quickly change its classification.  Thus, within reason it is better for the local classification to be unknown rather than wrong.  A more sophisticated strategy that passes a weighting along with the classification, limits the total number of certain types, weighs certain local classifications more than others, or stops changing the classification after a threshold, could all be considered as possible improvements to this simple global algorithm 4  S IMULATION R ESULTS  The serial decision-fusion problem was simulated in the context of an X-band radar tracking the reentry vehicle RV\and spent tank from a separating short-range theater ballistic missile The radar-target geometry is also fairly simple.  The missile launch point is about 300 km from the radar and the impact point is the same as the radar’s location.  The total flight time is about 350 seconds.  The trajectory was generated based on a WGS84 geoid using a high-order gravity model and neither target was tumbling.  The target enters the radar’s field of view shortly after booster burnout, about 80 seconds after launch.  The trajectory provides the radar with a view that covers a large range of aspect angles and consequently a good range of RCS and  values. The true RCS and  presented to the radar during the missile’s flight are shown respectively in Figure 4 and Figure 5.  Ideally   estimates should be close to the true values in Figure 5.  The radar model includes various effects that introduce errors in the estimate The radar model used in this simulation is a closed loop model that includes the calculation of in-phase and quadrature detection voltages, range-cell spreading due to matched filtering, maximu m-likelihood monopulse angleof-arrival estimation, cost-b ased measurement-to-track assignment, interacting-multiple-model track filtering track-based beam pointing, el ectronic scan loss, antenna beam-shape loss, polarization effects, SNR-based waveform selection and resource limits. The model also simulates many real-world effects including navigation errors, sensor biases, tropospheric refraction, instrumentation noise thermal noise, and most importantly aspect-dependent RCS fluctuations.  Developi ng radar-signal-processing algorithms in the face of all these effects is certainly a challenge for both radar-mode l and algorithm developers however, it can significantly reduce the risks involved in fielding an algorithm 100 150 200 250 300 350 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 Time \(sec RCS \(dbsm   RV Tank  Figure 4, Nominal RCS versus Time

In addition, the increase in SNR fluctuation does not appear consistent with a change in   from 75% to 20% \(Figure 5, RV\ reality, beam-pointing errors, angle-of-arrival errors waveform management, and range differences from dwell to dwell contribute to the SNR behavior seen in Figure 6 One way to eliminate these contributions would be base each estimate of  on only the subpulses in a single dwell Another possible solution is to use multiple dwells and base the estimate of  on the detected RCS.  Using RCS removes the effects of waveform management and changing range but still includes fluctuations caused by beam-pointing and angle-of-arrival errors.  Angl e-of-arrival errors might be reduced by substituting filtered track-state angles for the angles measured during the dwell.  The use of filtered track states was not investigated.  Even so, the RCS versus time data plotted in Figure 7 appear to be more consistent with a reduction in  from left to right Of course the real test come s when measured SNR and RCS data are used to estimate  Plots of estimated RV  versus time for N equal to 100 and 250 are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, respectively.  Increasing N results in smoother estimates for  however, increasing N also introduces significant regions of drop out for the SNR-based estimate These drop outs occur because a changing target range and a changing pulse-width mean that over the sample size SNR fluctuations cannot be completely attributed to the target’s characteristics.  W ith measured RCS, there are fewer drop outs because the RCS calculations compensate for both range and wavelength 100 150 200 250 300 350 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 Time \(Sec RCS \(dB m 2   Figure 7, Detected RV RCS versus Time 100 150 200 250 300 350 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Time \(Sec Kappa \(N=100   Truth RCS k SNR k  Figure 8, Estimated RV  versus Time, N=100 100 150 200 250 300 350 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Time \(Sec Kappa \(N=250   Truth RCS k SNR k  Figure 9, Estimated RV  versus Time, N=250 The revisit rate used in Figure 8 and Figure 9 was 50 Hz and a sliding window was used to estimate  at every revisit 


 6 time.  This sort of sustained revisit is not realistic for a radar that must share resources acr oss functions that include search, track, and classification.  A more realistic classification schedule would have the radar enter classification mode, for example, 2 seconds out of every 20 seconds Data for the four conditional probabilities, RV as an RV RV as a tank, tank as an RV, and tank as a tank for a 2 second classification interval every 20 seconds are plotted in Figure 10.  The results of the local decision method with the cost of assigning to Unknown set equal to -.5 is shown in Figure 11.  Most of the time the local classifications are correct.  This is consistent with the conditional probability plots.  The fused, global classification is shown in Figure 12 For the tank, the fused-serial classifier was able to replace the incorrect decisions at the lo cal level by instead asserting an unknown type.  A local classification of unknown was also replaced by a correct classi fication.  Here it is fairly obvious that a history of previous classifications would certainly help the serial process through isolated unknown or incorrect local classifica tions.  For the RV, the fusedserial classification delays th e misclassification near the end of the trajectory but it cannot fully correct for it          100   150   200   250   300   350   0   0.5   1   1.5   2         Time \(Sec Probability              RV as RV  RV as Tank  Tank as RV  Tank as Tank   Figure 10, Conditional probabilities for a 2 second classification window executed every 20 seconds          100   150   200   250   300   350   RV   Tank                                                                                               Time \(Sec True Type              RV as RV     RV as Tank   RV as Unknown  Tank as Tank     Tank as RV   Tank as Unknown   Figure 11, Local classification with an unknown” cost of 0.5          100   150   200   250   300   350   RV   Tank                                                                                                   Time \(Sec True Type              RV as RV     RV as Tank   RV as Unknown  Tank as Tank     Tank as Unknown   Figure 12, Serial-fused global classification Beginning at around 250 seconds, the RV’s orientation is such that it’s RCS and  values start to approach the tank’s values.  When this happens, th e local decisions are biased toward the tank because the ta nk’s conditional probability is more concentrated in that area For this particular scenario a stopping rule would correctly fix the classifications.  For a different scenario \(e.g., one in which the initial target-sensor geometry is not as favorable\opping rule might cause the classification fix at the wrong value 5  C ONCLUSIONS  The results from this preliminary investigation are very promising and warrant furthe r investigation along several directions.  The classification behavior of the decentralized approach based on RCS kappa for more than two, known target types is a much more interesting but much more difficult problem.  For this problem, additional discriminates, a serial structur e that passes more than a yes or no answer, and a short history of previous decisions will probably be necessary.  Even so, the mathematical framework for extending the technique is readily available in the literature.  Another interesting problem would be the classification behavior when the algorithm is presented with a target with RCS statistics different from the assumed target statistics.  Under these conditions, it may be possible to improve the robustness of the classification by building a conditional probability based on more than one target type from the same class of targets In this way, the classifier may be able to decide between general target classes even if it is unable to identify a specific target within the class Finally, the fused-serial approach is ideally suited for use as a multi-sensor classification architecture particularly in a network of heterogeneous sensors.  The architecture has a low communication overhead and relies on relatively simple data from each sensor R EFERENCES  1  R. Viswanathan and P.K.

9 when attempting to adaptively cancel an interference with time-varying relative geometry, such as would occur with a spacecraft orbiting a distant planet Compensation of Antenna Pointing Errors Pointing error is also a significant source of gain loss for the large antennas of the DSN at 32 GHz. Presently a complex monopulse pointing system is used to aid in pointing the DSN 34-meter antennas at 32 GHz. The blind pointing requirement on the antennas is driven by the pull-in range of this monopulse system requiring elaborate pointing models and calibration.  Use of a focal plane array eliminates the need for a monopulse system entirely, and greatly reduces the requireme nts on blind pointing accuracy and associated calibration effort Figure 8 shows the gain of the 70-meter antenna for signals appearing off bore-site when a single corrugated horn is used as the feed, and for th e case of an 81-element array used with a re-imaging magnification factor of three. The response for the single horn feed effectively is that of a uniform aperture, resulting in a 3-dB beamwidth of approximately 7.5 mdeg. Theref ore in practice the antenna must be pointed, without feedback, to approximately this accuracy before an active pointi ng control system such as a monopulse system or CONSCAN can be employed to actively point to the beam peak.  On the other hand, the response of the focal plane array to off-axis signals is quite forgiving, as illustrated by the black curve on the figure. In this case the response is not limited by the inherent beamwidth of the antenna, but rather by the field of view of the array. For this particular magnification and array size pointing errors of greater than +/- 20 mdeg can be accommodated  by the array with essentially no gain loss These pointing requirements are consistent with typical 8 GHz \(X-Band\ues, allowing operation of the 70-meter antenna at 32 GHz with no requirement for an additional active pointing system or improvements to the present blind pointing performance of the antenna. While illustrated here for the 70-meter antenna, exactly the same advantages exist for application of the FPA on a smaller, 34-meter DSN antenna. Relaxation of antenna pointing requirements is considered a major advantage of the focal plane array over a single horn feed 3  S UMMARY AND C ONCLUSION  The operational advantages of a focal-plane array receiver for use on large antennas of the Deep Space Network have been discussed. Examples of gravity compensation of the 70-m antenna during 32-GHz operation has been used to illustrate these advantages. In addition, an adaptive 


10 algorithm for optimal combining of focal-plane array signals in a noisy environment, including interference, has been described and evaluated via simulation. Finally mitigation of antenna pointing errors via focal-plane array processing is illustrated, providing additional benefits over the use of a single receiving horn A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration R EFERENCES    V Vi l n rot t e r and Fort Dem onst r at i on and Eval uat i on of the Ka-Band Array Feed Compensation System on the 70-Meter Antenna at DSS 14," TMO PR 42-139, JulySeptember 1999, pp. 1-17, November 15, 1999    V Khai ki n, E.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
