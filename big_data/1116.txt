enterprises' text repositories \(e.g., email archives digital libraries, etc.\ desirable to develop effective knowledge management tools to process this unstructured data so as to extract  domain knowledge for business decision making. Ontology-based semantic annotation of documents is one of the promising ways for knowledge discovery from text repositories. Existing semantic annotation methods usually require many labeled training examples before they can effectively operate, and this bottleneck holds back the widely applications of these semantic annotation methods.  In this paper, we propose a semisupervised semantic annotation method, self-teaching 
SVM-struct, which uses fewer labeled examples to improve the annotating performance. The key of the self-teaching method is how to identify the reliably predicted examples for retraining. Two novel confidence measures are developed to estimate prediction confidence. The experimental results show that the prediction performance of our self-teaching semantic annotation method is promising   1. Introduction  Nowadays, knowledge has become a very key factor for making successful decisions, and most big companies make large investments in Knowledge 
Management Systems \(KMS\ and knowledge discovery for decision support. But most data stored in KMS are text documents, and current KMS has limited capabilities for interpreting the text documents. In order to effectively use the valuable text data for decision support, it is necessary to make these texts to be "understandable" by Decision Support Systems DSS Semantic annotating documents using domain ontology is one of the promising ways to implement this object. Semantic annotation formally identifies 
concepts and relations between concepts in documents and is intended primarily for use by machines example, a semantic annotation might relate Bei Jing  in a text to an ontology which both identifies it as the abstract concept City and links it to the instance China of the abstract concept Country with the relation of CapitalOf Semantic annotation allows for more accurate information retrieval and better interoperability. For example, when searching 
information about city Bei Jing will be hit, since it is an instance of City Interoperability is particularly important for organizations, since their legacy databases exist in different proprietary formats Semantic annotation with common ontology can facilitate the integration of these heterogeneous data sources. As a result, with semantic annotation, DSS can effectively utilize the valuable knowledge hidden in the text repositories: 1\ DSS can "understand documents to retrieve more accurate information and 
make better inference for decision support; 2\ DSS can exploit vast and heterogeneous legacy data for decision support Manual annotating documents needs lots of labor cost and time, so some automatic and semi-automatic methods are proposed. Among them, sequence model based approaches are very effective for semantic annotation, since these models can describe the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE

As a result, sequence models have not been widely used for semantic annotation in practice One main contribution of this paper is that a semisupervised learning method, self-teaching SVM-struct is proposed for semantic annotation, which only needs fewer labeled examples. The idea of this method is using the reliably predicted examples as the training examples to retrain the SVM-struct model to improve performance. The latest and best sequence model SVM-struct ad opted h e re. A n d accordin g to th e  characters of SVM-struct, we design two confidence measures to identify the reliably predicted examples for retraining. The experimental results show that this method really improved the performance of semantic annotation The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 introduces some background knowledge of semantic annotation and SVM-struct model. Section 3 describes our self-teaching SVM-struct algorithm and the confidence measures. Section 4 describes our experiment and results. Section 5 introduces the related research in semantic annotation. Finally, we offer concluding remarks and describe future direction of our research work  2. Background Knowledge  2.1. Semantic Annotation as Sequence Labeling  Semantic annotation can be resolved with the rule induction and classification methods. But recently sequence model based methods become a promising way for it, since these models enable describing dependencies between concepts, and the dependencies can be utilized to improve the accuracy of the annotation w e  u s e an ex a m ple to illustrate  that semantic annotation is modeled as the sequence labeling problem, and then is resolved with the sequence models  Bei Jing is the capital of the People's Republic of China  City  Country   In the above sentence Bei Jing is an instance of concept City and People's Republic of China is an instance of Country Then its corresponding label sequence is  Bei      Jing    is  the  capital  of   People's      Republic    of                China B-City I-City O  O    O          O    B-Country  I-Country  I-Country   I-Country  Here, the region information is coded by three kinds of labels B-concept  I-concept and O  B-concept  means that the current word is the beginning of an instance of the concept I-concept means that the current word is in an instance of the concept. And O  indicates that the word is not in an instance of any concept After reframing semantic annotation as sequence labeling problem, the task of semantic annotation can be seen as: for a given sentence, finding the right label sequence for it. For the sequence model-based methods, some examples with right label sequences are given as training examples first, and a sequence model is trained based on these examples. Finally, the trained model is used to predicate the label sequences of other unlabeled sentences The formal definition of semantic annotation with sequence models is given below For a given the ontology Ont the concept set is defined as    Ont c c ClassSet i i   here i c is a concept Then, the label set from this ontology is defined as     _  _     O c I l c B l ClassSet c l LabelSet j i j i j i           that is LabelSet consists of the labels with B_ or I_ as the prefixes of concepts. The sequence modelbased method for semantic annotation is The input space is       2 1 WordSet w w w w w x x X t T t i i    here i x is a sentence consisting of multiple words The output space is       2 1 LabelSet l l l l l y y Y t T t i i    here i y is the label sequence Given some labeled training examples n i i i y x 1     here Y y X x i i    a mapping function Y X f   is learnt using these training examples. For an unlabeled sentence x    x f is the predicted label sequence which is the semantic annotation for that sentence  2.2. SVM-struct for Sequence Labeling  There are several sequence models for sequence labeling, such as HMM and CRF. Here, we will adopt SVM-struct, since it leads to better performance than HMM and CRF T h e m o ti v a tion of th e SVM s tru c t  algorithm is driven by the idea of the maximum large margin from Support Vector Machine \(SVM o r structured output problems, such as sequence labeling and syntactic tree analysis i n d a righ t  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 
 


parameter to optimally separate the right structured output from other. The basic idea of SVM-struct is as follows Let X and Y are the input and output space, and Y y X x     y can be any complex structure\d n i i i y x 1     is a set of training examples. First, a linear discriminant function is defined by            y x y x F 012 012 here    y x  is the feature representation function and represents the combined features of input x and output y The corresponding mapping function f is defined by the expression     max arg    012 012 y x F x f Y y   The SVM-struct method solves the following optimization problem     to get the right parameter 012 to achieve optimal separation. Here    y y i  is the loss function For the sequence labeling problem x is a sentence and y is a label sequence. Similar with HMM, the feature representation function can include the combined features of input sentences and labels, and features between adjacent labels. The maximization of        y x i 012 over y can be carried out by dynamic programming \(Viterbi algorithm th e f o llo w i ng sections, we exactly utilize the characters of Viterbi algorithm for our novel prediction confidence measures  3. Self-teaching SVM-struct for Semantic Annotation  Although, the previous research shows that SVMstruct leads to promising performance for sequence labeling when compared with other sequence models  s u ff ers  f r o m th e s a m e  w e akn e ss of oth e r  sequence models, that is, requiring a large number of labeled training examples. In this section, a novel selfteaching method of SVM-struct is proposed to alleviate this partially for semantic annotation  3.1. Self-Teaching SVM-struct Algorithm  The self-teaching learning is a kind of semisupervised learning, which uses the reliably predicted unlabeled examples to retrain the model to improve the prediction performance. The process of the selfteaching is: first train a learning model based on small amount of labeled data, and then use the learning model to predict unlabeled examples. Typically, the most confident unlabeled examples, together with their predicted labels, are added into the training example set. The learning model is re-trained and the procedure is repeated until the stop condition is satisfied [8 h e self-teaching SVM-struct algorithm for semantic annotation uses SVM-struct model in the self-teaching process. The algorithm is as follows  Table 1. Self-teaching SVM-struct Algorithm ____________________________________________ Let L i i i L y x D 1      be the initial labeled training examples Let U L j j U x D 1      be the unlabeled examples 1. Train SVM-struct model M on L D  2. Use M to predict the label sequence  j y for every j x in U D  3              j j j L L y conf y x D D  4. If           j j y conf y decreases, or iteration number 015  Then stop, Else go to step 1 ____________________________________________  The key step 3 in this algorithm means if the confidence of the prediction  j y is high enough  j y  together with the sentence j x is added into the training examples set to retrain SVM-struct model. The performance of this algorithm heavily depends on the prediction confidence measure. In the following section, two novel confidence measures are proposed  3.2. Confidence Measure  In the self-teaching SVM-struct algorithm, the confidence measure of the predicted label sequence plays the key role. A good measure can select the good predicted examples to retrain SVM-struct model, and improve the semantic annotation performance Otherwise, the poor predicted examples will damage the performance For usual generative sequence models \(such as HMM\e conditional probability     j j x y P is a very good measure to identify how probable  j y is the right label sequence for j x But SVM-struct is a discriminative model rather than a generative model so the conditional probability     j j x y P is not readily available here. According to the character of SVMstruct, two special confidence measures are described  3.2.1 Ratio of the Top Two Viterbi Path Costs Measure In the section 2.2, we know that, when    n i i C 1 2  2 1 min  012  012 i i i i i y y y x F y x F y n j t s                     1    Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 
 


making the prediction for the input x SVM-struct tries to find an output y to maximize     012 y x F and then this y is the prediction for x For the sequence labeling problem, SVM-struct adopts the Viterbi algorithm a x i m i ze     012 y x F efficiently. The process is as follows  Table 2. Viterbi algorithm used in SVM-struct ____________________________________________ Let T t w w w w x   2 1  be the input sentence Let 1 l  2 l  i l  LabelSet l LabelSet  be possible labels Let   i t l  store the maximal cost of the label path with i l at the ending position t   Initialization         1 1 i i l w l  012    where the feature weight vector 012 represents the weights of different features, and the feature representation function    1 i l w  represents the combined features of the word 1 w and the label i l   Recursion             max    1  1           i i t t l i t l l l w l l  012  012     1  1   T t where the feature representation function     i l l  represents the combined features of the adjacent labels  l at the position t and i l at the position 1  t  ____________________________________________  Assuming   i T l  is the maximal cost, and the labels covered by   i T l  compose the predicted label sequence for input x     Picture 1. An Example of the Prediction  In picture 1, the path indicated by the solid arrow has the maximal cost, so the labels \(the black points covered by this path are the prediction for the sentence  Bei Jing is the capital of the People's Republic of China  From the above, we know that the prediction for a sentence is the label sequence with maximal path cost If a prediction is highly confident, its path cost should have an obvious difference with the second largest path cost. Otherwise, if the difference is small, it is very possible that this prediction is not right. So the ratio of the maximal path cost to the second largest path cost is a good indicator for the prediction confidence. If this ratio exceeds a special threshold, we can think this prediction is confident and can be added into the training example set. Also this ratio can be calculated efficiently with the Viterbi algorithm for the maximal path cost and second largest path cost  3.2.2 Annotated Semantic Concepts Confidence Measure Although the ratio of the top two path costs can measure the confidence of the predicted label sequence, it does not differentiate the semantic concept labels B-Concept and I-Concept rom the blank label O d handle them totally equally. So this measure does not consider the confidence of the annotated semantic concepts, which should be the focus points in semantic annotation. We propose another confidence measure, the Annotated Semantic Concepts Confidence Measure. The intuition of this measure is that assuming the semantic concepts annotated in the maximal cost path are right, and these right concepts are labeled as other concepts in another path, this path cost will decrease greatly. So we use the ratio of the maximal path cost to the maximal cost of the path, which bypasses the semantic concepts annotated in the maximal cost path, as the second confidence measure O B-City I-City B-Country  I-Country    Bei       Jing         is            ......         of     China  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 
 


  Picture 2. An Example of the maximal cost path bypassing the semantic concepts  In picture 2, the concept labels covered by the maximal cost path in picture 1 are circled, which the label sequence must not pass when searching the maximal cost path bypassing the annotated semantic concepts In this example, if the searched path is the one indicated by the dashed arrow, the prediction confidence using this measure is the ratio of the cost of the black arrow path in picture 1 to the cost of the dashed arrow path in picture 2 For calculating the maximal cost of the path bypassing the special semantic concept labels, some constrains are added into the Viterbi algorithm, like  h e con s train t   t t l s C   means that at position t the label path can not pass the label t l For the above example C should be  _  _  2 1 City I s City B s   After adding some constrains, the formulas d table 2 are modified separately as follows otherwise l l if l w l i i i       0   1 1 1      012   otherwise l l if l l l w l l t i i i t t l i t               max 0   1  1  1              012  012   So this confidence measure can also be computing efficiently  4. Experimental Evaluation  4.1. Experiment Design  In order to evaluate the performance of the selfteaching SVM-struct for semantic annotation, a controlled experiment was performed. The results were compared with the sequence model based methods The GENIA benchmark corpus [9  w a s use d fo r  this experiment. The GENIA corpus is an annotated corpus for the biology domain. Some terms are annotated with the GENIA concept labels. The ontology for this experiment comes from the organic  branch of the GENIA ontology and contains 27 classes with 4 levels and 23 leaf node classes. After some preprocessing, 1144 sentences and the related label sequences were obtained. Two types of features associated with input sentences were used: 1\ord feature k w   2  1  0  1  2     k  k is the relative position from the current word, a negative value represents the preceding word, and a positive value represents the following word. 2\Part-Of-Speech \(POS\ of the current word pos  The sequence model based method and the selfteaching SVM-struct method with the two confidence measures were applied separately in this experiment The three metrics widely used in the information retrieval field, precision, recall, and f-score, were adopted in this experiment. Precision means the ratio of the right predicted semantic concepts to all predicted semantic concepts by the algorithm, recall means the ratio of the right predicted semantic concepts by the algorithm to all original semantic concepts, and f-score is a mixture of precision and recall     2  recall precision recall precision score f      The SVMstru o f t w a re pack a g es  w e re rev i s e d in t h i s  experiment The experiment contained two settings.

In setting 2, 193 sentences \(about 5,000 words\d their labels were as the training examples, and 227 sentences about 6,000 words\were as the testing examples  4.2.

The self-teaching SVM-struct with the ratio of top two path costs raises f-score and precision in setting 2, but damages them in setting 1 This experiment indicates the self-teaching SVMstruct with annotated semantic concept confidence measure can stably improve the performance, but the one with the top two path costs measure does not always improve the performance  5. Related Work  Many research efforts have been done for semantic annotation. However, most of the previous work uses classification methods or sequence model based methods, and few of them tried to use fewer labeled training examples to improve the performance. The previous work can be categorized as the follows 1. Rule Induction Method. Rule induction is employed for the semantic annotation. For example  learn an n o tatio n ru le s f r o m t h e trai n i ng data  Although rule induction has better precision, the recall is not very high 2. Classification Method. The method views semantic annotation as a problem of classification. It learns a classifier from training examples to detect the types of the test examples. For example, SCORE Enhancement Engine \(SEE\upports web page annotation by using classification model [11    3. Sequence Model Based Meth tilized  HMM in semantic annotation. But HMM needs lots of training examples to enumerate all possible observation sequences  6. Conclusions and Future Work  In this paper, a novel self-teaching SVM-struct model is proposed to improve the performance of semantic annotation with fewer labeled examples Especially, two prediction confidence measures are described for the self-teaching SVM-struct. The experimental results show this method achieves promising performances In the future, more features from text, such as prefix, suffix, verb, syntactic relations, etc. will be added into the models to improve the precision. In addition, the co-training method is also an optional way to increase the performance, and we will explore the co-training between CRF and SVM-struct models for semantic annotation  7.

Memory Benchmarks We evaluated the memory performance using two benchmarks: a streaming copy benchmark and the random memory access benchmark from Section III The streaming copy benchmark is simple: it allocates a memory buffer, divides it in two, and copies data from one region to the other using PowerPC 450 parallel load/store instructions. The benchmark reports the theoretical peak memory performance if it is run in a noise-free environment The results for several different buffer sizes can be found in Table III. With a 16KB buffer size, which ?ts well in the L1 cache, all kernels perform equally well, because no TLB misses are caused by the benchmark even under standard Linux with 4KB pages. With larger buffers, such as 4MB \(which ?t in the L3 cache which do not ?t Linux kernel is signi?cantly lower than under CNK. Linux with Big Memory shows a 0.2% loss compared to CNK This is a small performance hit, but it is still larger than expected, given that the noise level has been measured at just 0.03% \(see Section III detailed investigation of this phenomenon, but we suspect that instruction cache thrashing at context switch time caused by the OS tick update might be responsible; the benchmark issues a series of parallel load/store instructions, and the cost of cache thrashing might be higher than for an FPU benchmark Table III STREAMING COPY BENCHMARK \(GB/S 16KB 4MB 256MB CNK 6.74 4.60 3.85 Linux 4KB 6.73 3.85 3.35 Linux 64KB 6.74 4.51 3.82 Linux Big Memory 6.74 4.59 3.84 In Section III, we showed the results of the random memory access benchmark on CNK and on Linux with paged memory; there was a large difference in performance Table IV adds the result for Linux with Big Memory support the gap to CNK is narrowed to 0.04%, or within the system noise level Table IV RANDOM MEMORY ACCESS BENCHMARK MB/s CNK 44.70 Linux 4KB 14.39 Linux 64KB 16.40 Linux Big Memory 44.68 B.

LOFAR Online Central Processing We had the opportunity to observe the performance of Big Memory in a real-life application. LOFAR is a radio telescope being built in the Netherlands [15]. In contrast to current radio telescopes that employ custom-built hardware as a correlator, LOFAR uses a Blue Gene/P supercomputer Our previous work discusses the LOFAR central processor in more detail [7], [16 LOFAR stations stream UDP/IP data directly into the Blue Gene/P I/O nodes at a rate of slightly more than 3Gbps These I/O nodes store the data in a main memory ring buffer which is used to absorb network delays or temporary hiccups in the processing pipeline. From here the data is transported to the compute nodes, where the information is correlated Poor main memory performance of the I/O node running the default Linux kernel proved to be one of the major bottlenecks in trying to achieve optimum data throughput Table VII shows a breakdown of the tasks on the Blue Gene/P I/O nodes running the LOFAR online processing application in a fairly standard 16-bit observation mode and a more challenging 4-bit mode. The required CPU resources in processor cores, are shown for the stock IBM I/O node kernel in the 16-bit mode and for a ZeptoOS compute node kernel, modi?ed to run on the I/O nodes, for both the 16bit and 4-bit modes. We see that using the original I/O node kernel would require almost two entire I/O node cores just to handle the ring buffer, and that there are not enough compute resources available to perform all the tasks in real time, even for the less demanding 16-bit mode We used a slightly modi?ed ZeptoOS compute node kernel, including support for the Ethernet device and excluding compute node speci?c devices like the torus network, on the I/O node. We reserved 1536MB of main memory as the Big Memory area and used it for the ring buffer using six 256MB TLB entries. The I/O node application was also adapted to copy 128 UDP/IP packets into the ring buffer at once, instead of one at a time. These two optimizations reduce the resources required to copy data into the ring buffer by more than 600%, about half of which can be attributed to the lack of TLB misses in the Big Memory area The more challenging 4-bit mode signi?cantly increases the potential number of TLB misses. Although limitations in the default kernel make direct comparison impossible smallscale memory benchmarks show a more than 500 reduction in required CPU cycles using Big Memory when 


reduction in required CPU cycles using Big Memory when copying UDP/IP packets one by one Clearly, the access pattern of the LOFAR I/O node application is very susceptible to performance hits caused by TLB misses. With the stock I/O node kernel, the processor was unable to achieve our throughput requirements. Preventing TLB misses for at least part of the application, combined with several other optimizations not discussed here, allowed us to reduce CPU load considerably, increasing I/O node performance to well beyond our original requirements Table VII LOFAR I/O NODE PROCESSING \(#CORES Stock ZeptoOS 16 bit 16 bit 4 bit Receive UDP/IP packets 1.44 1.44 1.22 Copy data to ring buffer 1.80 0.27 0.37 Send ring buffer to CN 1.40 0.52 0.61 Receive data from CN 1.00 0.10 0.35 Send results to storage 0.40 0.32 0.64 Total system load 151% 66.5% 79.7 VI. CONCLUSIONS This paper presented the implementation of Big Memory support for BG/P Linux  a transparent, ?at memory space for computational processes. Big Memory addresses two major issues encountered when attempting to run highperformance code on the BG/P Linux: poor memory performance caused by TLB misses handled in software, and the dif?culties of writing an ef?cient communication stack caused by the limitations of the BG/P torus  DMA engine Our experiments have shown that benchmarks running under a standard Linux kernel with paged memory can run up to three times slower than under CNK. With Big Memory support, Linux is slower by only 0.03  0.2%. We think that the 0.03% loss is due to the time spent executing the OS tick interrupt handler; with some benchmarks this can grow to 0.2%, presumably because of instruction cache thrashing With further kernel tuning, it should be possible to reduce the noise level to close to zero. Experiments at scale showed a slowdown of well under 1 71 Employing Big Memory on the I/O nodes was instrumental in reducing the I/O node CPU resources required for LOFAR online central processing. A 500  600% performance increase was observed in key parts of the application allowing the I/O nodes to achieve their required throughput Our modi?cations to the Linux kernel are relatively small principally because we focused exclusively on the requirements of computational processes, rather than trying to solve the problem in a generally applicable way, which would have been far more complicated. We maintain two versions of Linux kernel, and we found porting the Big Memory patches between the kernels to be straightforward Contemporary parallel architectures such as Blue Gene/P Cray XT5, and Roadrunner use commodity CPUs such as Intel Xeon, AMD Opteron, or IBM PowerPC, instead of designs dedicated to computational environments. The memory management units in these processors are essentially designed to support a highly multitasking environment. It would be interesting if future designs had hardware support for computational process address space similar to the Big Memory area that we implemented, to allow for a seamless coexistence of high-performance applications and standard Unix processes on the compute nodes Along with the Big Memory implementation, we conceived the idea of a special process that the kernel treats differently from other processes. In the case of Big Memory the kernel creates a different application address space, and we showed that this idea works for compute nodes. We have also experimented with other uses of this feature, such as disabling nonessential interrupts when a computational process gets scheduled in order to reduce the system noise Our current implementation is suitable for benchmarking 


Our current implementation is suitable for benchmarking and simple applications. We need to make several improvements in the quality of implementation, such as the granularity of the Big Memory area. So far, we have had little experience with running large, real-world applications on the compute nodes using our modi?ed kernel; this area will be explored as part of our future research Acknowledgments: We thank IBM  s Todd Inglett Thomas Musta, Thomas Gooding, George Alma  si, Sameer Kumar, Michael Blocksome, and Robert Wisniewski for their advice on programming the Blue Gene hardware.

interact with strategic and structural properties of a firm Also, as we see growing amounts of regulation and stronger public reactions to how firms conduct their business, compliance issues have received increased attention. Especially from an IT governance perspective, two questions are exciting to ask: How are alignment and compliance related, i.e. to what extent can or should the dimensions of alignment be an explicit part of compliance activities? And one step further: As regulation regarding internal controls like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the USA affects almost all IT activities [61] this is a highly relevant issue. From an IT business value perspective, IT business alignment may be a driver but IT compliance may act as a constraint In practice, combining the demands for compliance and value delivery of IT is widely seen as the domain of IT governance [43]. This leads to the second question: Is there a positive business value impact from compliance beside just being compliant, i.e. do improvements from better governance/alignment structures and actions would have been worth the effort even without external regulatory pressure Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 References   1] Alavi, M. and Leidner, D.E., "Review: Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual Foundations and Research Issues", MIS Quarterly 25\(1 2] Armstrong, J.S. and Overton, T.S., "Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys", Journal of Marketing Research, 14 3] Avison, D., Jones, J., Powell, P., and Wilson, D., "Using and Validating the Strategic Alignment Model", Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13\(3 4] Barua, A., Kriebel, C.H., and Mukhopadhyay, T., "Information Technologies and Business Value: An Analytical and Empirical Investigation", Information Systems Research, 6\(1 5] Bassellier, G. and Benbasat, I., "Business Competence of Information Technology Professionals: Conceptual Development and Influence on IT-Business Partnerships MIS Quarterly, 28\(4 6] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Gomber, P., Wagner, H.-T and Weitzel, T., "Die Bedeutung des Alignments von IT und Fachressourcen in Finanzprozessen: Eine empirische Untersuchung", Wirtschaftsinformatik, 48\(5 339 7] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of outsourcing on IT business alignment and IT flexibility: a survey in the German banking industry",  Twelfth Americas Conference on Information Systems AMCIS 8] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "Strategy matters - The role of strategy type for IT business value",  12th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS 9] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of operational alignment on IT flexibility Empirical evidence from a survey in the German banking industry",  13th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS CO 10] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The Influence of Alignment on the PostImplementation Success of a Core Banking Information System: An Embedded Case Study",  40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences \(HICSS Big Island \(HI

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
