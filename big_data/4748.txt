Transaction data are usually useful for data mining. While it is high-dimensional data traditional anonymization techniques such as generalization and suppression are not suitable. In this paper, we present a novel technique based on anatomy technique and propose a simple linear-time anonymous algorithm that meets the l diversity requirement.  The simulation experiments on real datasets and the results of association rules mining on the anonymous transaction data showed that our algorithm can safely and efficiently preserve the privacy in transaction data publication while ensuring high utility of the released data Index TermsÑl diversity, anatomy technique, privacy preservation, association rules mining  I   I NTRODUCTION  Privacy preservation in transaction data publication is a hotspot issue in privacy-preserving data publishing Transaction data consist of many aspects such as querying log online shopping, supermarket transaction data and so on Transaction data are usually used for data mining, including association rule mining  3  use r be ha vi o r pr ed i c t i o n  and recommender systems. Therefore, when we publish data for scientific research, it must be anonymized so that malicious attacker cannot re-identify userês privacy information. We first show two examples for re-identification on transaction data 10  Example 1. Bob has bought some things in the supermarket including bread, milk, biscuits, red wine, beef, ice-cream, light bulbs and home pregnancy test strips. Assume that some of the items purchased by Bob were on top of his shopping bag \(e.g bread, milk, light bulbs\ and his neighborhood Alice was in the same bus. Bob would not want Alice to know what s/he has bought \(i.e., home pregnancy test strips\. But if the supermarket decides to release its transaction data and there is only one record containing bread, milk and light bulbs, then Alice can immediately refer that this record corresponds to Bob and s/he can find out the rest thing Bob purchased Example 2. AOL recently released a query log database [1 2 i n a n al y z i ng t h e s e re co rd s   t h e  N o  4 4177 49 user w a s fo u n d  as a 62-year-old widow Thelma Arnold who lives in Liburn Although not a record that contains her address or name, but a malicious attacker can still re-identify the userês personal information using items permutations and combinations In these examples, the data holder publishes transaction data for research purposes. Each transaction record contains an arbitrary set of items. An item can be either public \(i.e. bread milk and light bulbs\ private \(i.e. home pregnancy test strips The attacker attempts to re-identify the subset of some transaction records. As background knowledge, the attacker knows that the target person \(i.e., Bob\ has a transaction record in the published data and certain public items \(e.g., bread, milk light bulbs\. If there are very few transaction records containing these items, the re-identification will be successful Many privacy models, such as k-anonymity [4,5   l diversity [7 an d tcl os en es s  8   ar e u s ed t o  pr ev en t r e identification attacks on low-dimensional relational data, but directly adopt these to high-dimensional unstructured data will not produce good results. These models anonymize the public attributes \(i.e., quasi-identifiers\ to prevent the attacker using link attack to infer the privacy of personal information However, for transaction data, any attribute \(i.e., item permutations and combinations are considered as the attacker's background knowledge. Therefore, these models are not suitable to solve transaction data. Paper [9 p o in t e d  o u t th at  th e  high-dimensional data are more easily attacked by inference attack, and to achieve a degree of anonymity, a large number of data information will be lost Traditionally there are two ways to achieve data anonymity generalization and suppression. Generalization is to replace a value to a more general one, such as use drink to replace milk and beer. Suppression is to delete the existing record, so the user cannot see it in the publishing data Currently there is only a few works to research privacy preservation in transaction data rt i t i o ns hi ghdimensional data set into private and public item set and proposed \(h,k,p\-coherence model.

The query accuracy of anatomy is unaffected by the dataset dimensionality, where as the accuracy of generalization decays severely as dimensionality increases. Furthermore, anatomized tables can be computed much faster than generalized tables Transactional data is high-dimensional data, and our goal is to adopt this technique to transaction data However, anatomy requires a clear separation between quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes, for transaction data we can not completely distinguish quasi-identifier between sensitive attributes. Therefore, we modified anatomy technique so that it can be used in transaction data The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the preliminaries for our method are reviewed. In section 3, the privacy preservation model based on anatomy technique is proposed. A linear-time anonymous algorithm is illustrated in section 4. The experimental results of the proposed algorithms are argued in section 5. In section 6, we conclude the paper and discuss future work II  P RELIMINARIES  Definition 1 \(p-item set\ Let I 1 I 2  I m be the set consist of m different items where each item I k k=1,2 m equivalent to a attribute. Let D={T 1 T 2  T n be the n transaction records in transaction data. Record T i i=1,2 n\ is also called item set. Each record T i is a subset of attributes and T i  A. The length of item set is the number of items in the item set. If the length is p, this item set is called p-item set Definition 2 \(item partition and columns\n item partition consists of several subsets of A, and each item belongs to exactly one subset. Each subset of items is called a column. Let there be p columns C 1 C 2 C p then A U p i   1 and for any 1 i j p    j i C C  In transaction data, it is difficult to distinguish quasiidentifier between sensitive attributes. In this paper, we view each item in transaction data as the same type that is quasiidentifiers Definition 3 \(record partition and buckets\A record partition consists of several subsets of D, and each record belongs to exactly one subset. Each subset of record is called a bucket. Let there be q buckets B 1 B 2 B q then D U q i   1  and for any 1 i j q    j i B B  174 WeP2.5 


     Definition 4 \(multi-dimension anatomy\. Given a transaction table T, a multi-dimension anatomy of T consists of item partition and record partition Definition 5 l diverse multi-dimension anatomy\. A multidimension is l diverse, if each bucket B i 1 i q\tisfies the following conditions. Let v ij be the most frequent item set in bucket B i and column C j   and c\(v ij he number of records with T[C j v ij then c\(v ij B i  1 l 1 where |B i is the size \(the number of records\ of B i  Example 4. Table I\(D\ and Table I\(E\ are two multidimension anatomy table. In Table I\(D\, the item partition is d,e,f,h},{a,b,c,g}}, and the record partition is t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7 t 8 t 9 t 10 In Table I\(E\, the item partition is a,c},{b,e,g},{d,f,h}}, and the record partition is t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7 t 8 t 9 t 10 In Table I\(E\ item {b} appears 3 times and |B 1 equal to 5, while 3/5 1/2, so Table I\(E\ satisfies 2-diverse multi-dimension anatomy. Similarly, Table I\(D satisfies 2-diverse multi-dimension anatomy too Definition 7 \(matching buckets\. Let C 1 C 2 C p be the p columns of a multi-dimension anatomy table. Let t be a record and t[C i  e t h e  C i value of t. Let B be a bucket in the anatomy table, and B[C i  b e  th e m u ltiset o f C i values in B. We say that B is a matching bucket of t iff for all 1 i p t[Ci B[Ci  III  PRIVACY PRESERVATION MODEL BASED ON ANATOMY TECHNIQUE  In this section, we show how multi-dimension anatomy can be used to prevent privacy leak, based on the privacy requirement of l diversity LEMMA 1. Given an l diverse multi-anatomy transaction table T, let v ij be the most frequent item set in bucket B i and column C j   and c\(v ij the number of records with T[C j v ij  The attacker attempts to get the privacy information in column C j when s/he gets the information in other column except column C j Then, from the attackerês perspective  Pr{T[C j v ij c\(v ij B i 2 PROOF. Consider any record t D, while t does not contain the information in column C j The attacker who attempts to get the privacy information in column C j however does not have the column C j data. Hence, the attacker can only conjecture that equals one of the values in column C j Without any other information, the attacker assumes that every item in column C j has an equal probability, which leads to \(2 Example 5. Table I\(E\ satisfies the 2-diverse multidimension anatomy. Consider the item set {d,f,h} in t 2 To determine the privacy information of t 2 we have to examine t 2 s matching buckets. When we examine C 1 in Table I\(E\, we knows that t 2 must be in the first bucket B 1 because there are no matches items in bucket B 2 Therefore, we can conclude that t 2 must be in bucket B 1 Then, by examining the second column C 2 in bucket B 1 we know that the column value for t 2 must be either {b},{b,e} or {b,e,g}. Therefore, the probability of learning the information of t 2 is bounded by 1/3. By examining the third column C 3 in bucket B 1 we know that the column value for t 2 must be either {a} or {a,c}. Therefore, the probability of learning the information of t 2 is bounded by 1/2 Totally, the probability to determine t 2 is equal to 1/3*1/2=1/6 COROLLARY 1. Given an l diverse multi-anatomy transaction table T, the attacker can correctly re-construct any record t D with a probability at most 1 l  PROOF. Record t is correctly re-constructed. If and only if the attacker precisely obtains the all information otherwise the column C j when s/he attempts to infer the information in C j  column, by \(2\, we know that  Pr{T[C j  v ij c\(v ij B i where B i is the unique bucket containing t. Recall that table T is obtained from a l diverse multi-dimension partition\(Definition 5\. Hence, by \(1\, c\(v ij B i  1 l  THEOREM 1. Given an l diverse multi-anatomy transaction table T, the attackerês background knowledge is no more than p columns, he/she can correctly infer the information in other columns with a probability at most 1 l  PROOF. Let column C j be the privacy information the attacker attempts to obtain, let record o be the attackerês background knowledge. Consider record o is equivalent to those of totally f records t 1 t 2 t f in table T. Assume that record t i 1 i f\ belongs to bucket i j B 1 i j q, 1 i f where q is the total number of buckets. Let v real be the real column C j value of record o The attacker infers v real in two steps. First, s/he guesses that each of t 1 t f belongs to o with probability 1/f. Then, by Lemma 1, s/he figures out that v real is the column C j value of record o with probability   i i j real j B v c  Hence, the overall probability that the column C j value of record o is inferred equals    i i j f i real j B f v c     1  Recall that, by the property of l diverse multi-dimension anatomy\(Definition 5   i i j real j B v c  1 l Hence, the above formula is at most   l f i l f  1 1 1 1      THEOREM 2. Given an l diverse multi-anatomy transaction table T that has p columns, each bucket at lease introduce as many as l p records \(true record and faked record PROOF. After l diverse multi-dimension anatomy, for a bucket B i we can re-construct |B i  p records through permutations and combinations. Recall the property of l diverse multi-dimension anatomy\(Definition 5\, the number of different item set for each column in each bucket is at least l so we would get as many as l p records 175 WeP2.5 


     IV  A NONYM OUS  A LGORITHM BASED ON ANATOMY TECHNIQUE  In this section, we show an effective anonymous algorithm based on anatomy technique that meets the privacy requirement of l diversity. Our algorithm consists of two phases: item partition and record partition A  Item partition Our algorithm first split item set so that highly-correlated item set are in the same column. It is helpful to data utility and privacy. For data utility, grouping highly-correlated item set together helps protect the relationship between item set. For data privacy, the association of uncorrelated item set presents high identification risks because its values is much less frequent and thus more vulnerable to attack 1  Correlation measure Mean-square contingency coefficient s used f o r measuring correlations between two categorical attributes. We choose to use this measure because the transaction data can be viewed as categorical attributes containing only two values Given two attributes I 1 and I 2 with value domains {u 1 u 2 u d1  and {v 1 v 2 v d2 respectively. Their domain sizes are d1 and d2. The mean-square contingency coefficient between I 1 and I 2  is defined as            12 2 2 1 11 1   min 1 2 1 2  d i d j f f f f f d d j i j i ij I I  3 Here, f i and f j are the fraction of occurrences of u i and v j in the data, respectively. f ij is the fraction of occurrences of u i and v j in the data. For transaction data, the dimension is very large but only contains two value 0 and 1, 0 indicates there is no value in this item and 1 indicates there is a value in this item So \(3\ can be rewritten as    j i j i ij f f f f f I I     2 2 1 2   4 Here, f i and f j are the fraction of occurrences of u i 1 and v j 1in the data, respectively. f ij is the fraction of occurrences of u i 1  and v j 1 in the data. Because value 0 is meaningless, so we only calculate the value 1. It is easy to know that  1  0 2 1 2   I I   2  Item clustering Having computed the relationship between each pair of attributes, we use clustering to divide attributes into columns In our algorithm, each item is a point in the clustering space The distance between two items is defined as d\(I 1 I 2 1 2 1 2  I I  When two attributes are highly-correlated, the distance between them is smaller We use the k-medoid methods to achieve item clustering We use the well-known k-medioid algorithm PAM \(Partition Around Medoids\ algorithm [14  P A M  a l g o ri t h m fi r s t  randomly select k objects as the initial medoids, the remaining points will be assigned to the nearest medoid. Then, PAM chooses one medoid point and one non-medoid point and swaps them as long as the cost of clutering decreases. Here, the clustering cost is measured as the sum of the cost of each cluster, which is measured as the sum of the distance from each non-medioid point to the medoid point in the same cluster When no points can be swapped, program terminates. PAM's time complexity is O\(\(m-k 2 where m is the size of attributes and k is the number of cluster. PAM is suitable only for small amounts of data, however, the cluster space here is the number of attributes, therefore, PAM will not cost too much B  Record partition In the record partition phase, records are partitioned into buckets. Here we use a simple linear-time algorithm to handle record partition. Our algorithm is described in Figure 2 Algorithm Multi-Anatomy\(T l C,p  1. Multi-B  Bcnt = 0 2. Initialize p hash buckets Hi\(1 i p 3. For each record t in T 4. For each column C i in t, hash its value in hash buckets H i  5. if the most frequent value in each Hi satisfy c\(H i H i  1 l  6.

Then we scan each record in the transaction table T, for each column we hash its value in the corresponding hash bucket. If the table after partitioning satisfies l diversity \(line 3-5\, we add the records in hash bucket to Multi-B where Multi-B is the union of each buckets Then we clear all hash buckets \(line 6-9\. Finally, we randomly assign the left records to bucket if it satisfies l diversity \(line 10-12\. After that, the function returns the result Multi-B We now analyze the time complexity of the record partition We use p hash bucket and the complexity of hash is O\(1\. And we only scan each record once which takes O\(n\ time where n is the number of records. Totally, the time complexity of our algorithm is O\(n\\(m\, for m<<n, so the total time complexity is therefore O\(n V  E XPERIMENTS  In this section, we evaluated experimentally the proposed anonymization techniques. We evaluated three aspects: privacy leakage, data utility and execution time A  Experimental setup The experiments were performed on a 2.66 GHz Intel IV processor machine with RAM of 1 GB. The operating system was Windows XP Professional Edition, and the implementation was built and run in Visual C++ 6.0. We used two different datasets: Connect and T40I10D100K, all can be publicly 176 WeP2.5 


     available from FIMI Repository \(http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Connect is a real dataset containing game state information T40I10D100K is a synthetic dataset. T40I10D100K have a very large item set that is extremely larger than a relation table Table II provides a brief description of these datasets TABLE II  D ATASET S TATISTICS Dataset  Transactions|D  Average Length Items Data size\(K bytes  Connect 67,557 43 129 9,225 T40I10D100K 100,000 39.6 942 15,478  In our algorithm, attributes are partitioned into two or more columns. For a bucket that contains k records and p columns we generate k records as follows. We randomly permutated the values in each column because many data mining algorithms cannot handle anatomy table well currently B  Privacy leakages By Theorem 2, through l diversity multi-dimension anatomy a table is partition into p columns. The number of faked records would be very large Figure 3 is the number of faked records of T40I10D100K As expected, the number of faked records is so large that we have to use function ln. As shown in the figure 3, when we increase the value of l where l is the l diverse, the number of fake records becomes larger. In particular, when we increase the value of p where p is the number of columns, the number of fake records becomes exponentially larger Figure 3  Number of faked records of T40I10D100K C  Data utility In data utility, we use Apriori algorithm to mining association rules of anonymous data Because Connect is very dense, so we limit the length of association rules where the minimum length is 2 and maximum length is 4. Figure 4 shows the number of association rules of the anonymous data Connect when p=10 l 5,6,8,10. It shows that the different between anonymous data and original data is much small indicating that our algorithm for dense date set introduces little information Figure 5 shows the number of association rules of the anonymous data T40I10D100K when p=20 l 6,8,10,12. It shows that when the confident is low, such as confident=10 the difference between anonymous data and original data is very small. When confident increases, the gap increases slowly but the difference usually maintain at 40% -60 Figure 4  Number of association rules of Connect   Figure 5  Number of association rules of T40I10D100K  Figure 6  Accuracy radio of T40I10D100K 177 WeP2.5 


     The number of association rules is part of data utility, the correct number of association rules is also a key part of data utility So we introduce the following equation AR \(accuracy radio M / N where N is the number of association rules for original data and M is the number of common association rules for anonymous data Figure 6 is the accuracy radio of T40I10D100K. It shows that, when confident decreases, the accuracy radio increases Because our algorithm losses the information of unusual association rules while maintains the information of usual association rules D  Execution time Figure 7 is the time cost of T40I10D100K. It shows that our algorithm is very efficient, when the l value increases, the time cost will slightly increases because it costs a little more time to meet l diversity Figure 7  Time Cost of T40I10D100K VI  C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper, we study the privacy issues in transaction data publication. Based on anatomy technique, we propose a new privacy model called multi-dimension anatomy that meets the privacy requirement of l diversity and suits to transaction data We introduce a simple linear-time anonymous algorithm Experiments show that our algorithm can safely and effectively protect privacy in transaction data There are still a number of promising areas for future work First, the linear-time algorithm proposed in this paper seems a little simple, some new heuristic algorithm needs to further research. Second, while an anatomized table has been generated, it remains an open problem on how to use the anonymized data A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for this research by the NFS of Fujian Porvince under grants No 2009J01295, the NFS of Fujian Province under grants No 2010J01330 and scientific project of Fujian Provincial Department of Education under grants No. JA09004 R EFERENCES  1  K.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
