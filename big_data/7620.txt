Khartoum- Sudan giliter2001@yahoo.co.uk    ABSTRACT. The excessive use of the communication networks, rising of Internet of Things leads to increases the vulnerability to the important and secret information advance attacking techniques and number of attackers  are increasing radically. Intrusion is one of the main threats to the internet. Hence security issues had been big problem, so that various techniques and approaches have been presented 
to address the limitations of intrusion detection system such as low accuracy, high false alarm rate, and time consuming This paper proposes a hybrid machine learning technique for network intrusion detection based on combination of Kmeans clustering and Sequential Minimal Optimization SMO\ication. It introd uces hybrid approach that able to reduce the rate of false positive alarm, false negative alarm rate, to improve the det ection rate and detect zero-day attackers. The NSL-KDD data set has been used in the proposed technique.. The classification has been performed by using Sequential Minimal Optimization. After training 
and testing the proposed hybrid machine learning technique, the results have shown that the proposed technique \(K-mean + SMO\has achieved a positive detection rate of \(94.48%\d reduce the false alarm rate to 1.2%\ and achieved ac curacy of \(97.3695 Key words Intrusion detection, hybrid algorithm, SMO, Kmean, NLS KDD I  I NTRODUCTION  The acceleration and developm ent of computer network technology and Internet has brought huge convenience to people. However sensitive data and information stored on systems must be protected. The need for protecting data in 
computer systems became very necessary with the advent of shared systems; this need became more severe for systems being accessed over a pub lic network, the Internet Internet does not protect the information completely as the Internet is open system for general public Information transmitting over network system must be protected from unauthorized release and changes. The connection itself must be securely established and maintained [1  Due to recent development and advances in network technology, computer systems have become more vulnerable to attacks. N ovel attacks are appearing endlessly. In recent years, there are many statistics have 
shown that number of reported intrusions in the Symantec Global Internet Security Threat Report is growing [2 the other hand, protection techniques of such systems do not kept up with the increasing threat. Existing defense mechanisms such as user auth entication, data encryption and firewalls are used as the first line of defense against attacks Till date no combination of technology can protect the system completely because systems face novel attacks every other day. Therefore researchers are now attempting to find better and safer approach to minimize and overcome some limitation of existing prevention techniques, tools 
such as Firewall, Anti Virus, Intrusion Detection Prevention, and Response Systems have introduced. [3  In this paper  an approach to combine data mining techniques for clustering and classification \( k-mean clustering and sequential minimal optimization\ is introduced to enhance the performance of intrusion detection system parameters, discover and accurately identify new attacks by reducing the rate of false positive alarm, false negative alarm rate, detecting the intrusion in real time and making use of known attacks pattern in the train phase to increase the detection ratio II  I 
NTRUSION D ETECTION S YSTEM  Intrusion detection system \(IDS\ is a process or device that monitors events occurring on a network and analyzing it to detect any kind of activity th at threat computer security policies. The IDS device can be hardware, software or a combination of both that monitors the computer network against any unauthorized access 4 e main m o tiv e o f t h e 
 


IDS is to catch the attacker s before cause any serious damage to computer network systems The main purpose of IDS is to monitor the network system for any type of attacks, an attack might be signaled by something as simple as a program that could modify the user name or could be a complex attack that involves sequence of events spanning mu ltiple systems. IDS can be categorized as shown in Figure 1  Fig. 1. IDS categories   III  O RGANIZATION OF A GENERALIZED INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM  Figure 2 illustrates the overall architecture of IDS. It has been placed centrally to captu re all the incoming packets that are transmitted over the network. Data are collected and send for pre-processing to remove the noise; irrelevant and missing attributes are replaced. Then the preprocessed data are analyzed and classifi ed according to their severity measures. If the record is no rmal, then it does not require any more change or else it send for report generation to raise alarms. Based on the state of the data, alarms are raised to make the administrator to handle the situation in advance. The attack is modeled so as to enable the classification of network da ta. All the above process continues as soon as the transmission starts [5     Fig. 2. general antechoir of  IV  R ELATED WORK  A tool set known as production based expert system tool set P-BEST\ntroduced in [6 is to o l set wo rk s for misuse detection and developed a new signature corresponding to th e attacks; P-BEST provides a better mechanism and performance to de tect intrusion in real time environment. This was integr ated with th e c-programming which make it easy to use, powerful and flexible. But this tool was some limitation. This was less capable of detecting attacks or intrusion where data were incomplete, inaccurate and uncertain Audit Data Analysis and Mining \(ADAM\ is discussed in  be a real-tim e a nomaly detection system that uses data mining techniques to detect intrusions. ADAM uses a combination of association rules mining and classification to discover attacks in a TCP dump. ADAM performs anomalies detection in two phases: the training phase, and the testing phase. In the training phase, it uses a data stream for which we know the types of the attack. The attack-free parts of the stream are fed into a module that performs off-line association rules discovery. The output of this module is a profile of rules that we call “normal”. The profile along with the training data set is also fed into a module that uses a combination of a dynamic, on-line algorithm for association rules, whose output consists of frequent item sets that characterize attacks to the system This whole phase takes place off-line before using the system to detect intrusions. In the testing phase, the actual detection of intrusions is implemented Hybrid approach based on both misuse and anomaly detection was implemented on the NIDS  The m a in objective of this paper was to reduce the limitation of both detection techniques by combining with each other. In this paper for detecting the intrusion random forest data mining techniques were implemente d. Firstly random forest implemented for misuse detection in real time. After that it was implemented on the anomaly detection for detecting unknown attacks in an off-line mode. So by combining the two approaches the false alarm ratio and overall performance has been improved Semi-supervised learning technique was used in   Fi rst l y  unsupervised learning using K-means clustering. In which part of training instances, was trained using the Euclidean distance method. After that supervised learning performed using C4.5 algorithm algorithm. By applying the clustering the boundary was refined, it helps the C4.5 algorithm to detect anomalies with more accuracy. This semi-supervised learning technique performs better than unsupervised or supervised learning technique. But limitation was that it takes more time than simple classification or clustering. It was a disadvantage while detecting the real time traffic A a new clustering technique known as DGSOT Dynamically Growing Self-O rganizing Tree\with SVM was used to reduce the complexity while training phase in SVM [10  B y u s ing t h is app r o a ch it rem o v e t h e limitatio n of the traditional hierarchical clustering method. In DGSOT help to find the most qualified data points come as a boundary point while train SVM. This approach was classified dataset into two cl asses normal or abnormal on the basis of clustering algorithm V  ANOMALY DETECTOR S YSTEM D ESIGN  In this section, the new anomaly detector approach is proposed based on k-means clustering algorithm and Sequential Minimal Optimization \(SMO\o detect online network anomaly detection, the proposed approach aims to generate a suitable number of detectors with high detection 
 


accuracy. The main idea is base d on using feature selection in preprocessing phase to reduc e the number of features in dataset, The ConsistencySebsetEvel and Genetic search algorithms have been applied to select specific features from the dataset and remove those features which are irrelevant before clustering and classification phases, after attribute selection k-means clustering algorithm selected to reduced training dataset in order to decrease time and processing complexity. In classification phase supervised algorithm Sequential Minimal Optimization \(SMO selected to improve the quality of detection. The main stages are shown in Figure 3  Fig. 3. Model block diagram A  Pre-processing Pre-processing of original NSL-KDD intrusion data set is an important phase to make it as an appropriate input for classification phase. The main objective of preprocessing phase is to reduce ambiguity and provide accurate information to detection engine. The preprocessing phase cleans the network data by grouping, labeling and it handles the missing or incomplete dataset. The dataset preprocessing is achieved by applying the following stages sequentially B  Features Selection Features selection is the most critical stage in building a hybrid intrusion detection models and is equally important to improve the efficiency of data mining algorithms. In general, the input data to classifiers is in a high dimension feature space but not all of the features are relevant to the classes to be classified. So me of the data includes irrelevant, redundant or noisy features. In this case irrelevant and redundant features can introduce noisy data that distract the learning algo rithm. It decreases the number of attributes, eliminates irrelevant, noisy or redundant features and brings about effects on applications such as speeding up a data mining algorithm, improving learning accuracy and leading to better model comprehensibility During this step, the set of attributes or features deemed to be the most effective attributes which are extracted in order to construct suitable detection system The goal of features selectio n increases the detection rate and decreases the false alarm rate in network intrusion detection. WEKA 3.6 which is a machine learning tool has been used to compute the features selection subsets for hybrid approach \(K-mean +SMO n performance on each of these feature sets The ConsistencySebsetEvel and Genetic search algorithms have been applied to select specific features from the dataset and remove those features which are irrelevant before clustering and classification phases, the result shown in Figure 4   Fig. 4.

As the algorithm iterates through the training data each cluster’s architecture tr ansferred to another. The updating of clusters causes the values of the centroids to modify. This change is a reflection of the current cluster elements. When there are no changes to any cluster, the clustering of the K-Means algorithm becomes complete D  Classification phase Last phase is classification in this phase supervised algorithm Sequential Minimal Optimization \(SMO\was used to classify dataset to normal or anomaly VI  E XPERIMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND P ERFORMANCE EVALUATION  The experiment done by using WEKA\(WAIKATO ENVIRONMENT FOR KNOWLEDGE ANALYSIS WEKA is a Tool for Data Mining and Machine Learning which was implemented at the University of Waikato, in New Zealand in the year 1997. WEKA is a set of Machine Learning and Data Mining algorithms. This WEKA software is programmed in JAVA language and it has a GUI Interface to interact with data Files. With 49 data preprocessing tools WEKA tool contains 76 classification algorithms, 15 attribute evaluators and ten search algorithms for feature selectio n. There are three algorithms to find association rules. It also has three Graphical User 
 


Interfaces: "The Explorer", "The Experimenter" and "The Knowledge Flow." The file format to store data in WEKA is ARFF. Meaning of ARFF is Attribute Relation File Format. It also includes tool s for visualization. It has a several panels that can be used to perform precise tasks WEKA has the ability to expand and contain the new algorithms for Machine Learning in it. These expanded algorithms can directly be applied to dataset   A  Dataset Description Various drawbacks of KDD CUP 99 which was the main cause to decrease in the perfo rmance of various IDS led to the invention of NSL KDD dataset. NSL KDD is the refined version and also called the successor of KDD CUP dataset. It consists of all the needed attributes from KDD CUP dataset. It is an open source data and can be downloaded easily. The advantage of using this dataset is redundant record is removed and sufficient number of records is present for train and test data. It consists of 41 attributes which is classified under Nominal, Binary and Numeric [1   Table 1: NSL KDD dataset features Type Feature Nominal protocol_type, service, flag Binary land, logged_in, root_shell, su_atempted, Is_host_login, is_guest_login Numeric a duration, src_bytes, dst_bytes, wrong_fragment, urgent, hot num_failed_login, num_compromised, num_root, num_file_creations num_shells, num_access_files, num_out bound_cmds, count, srv_count serror_rate, srv_serror_rate, rerror_r ate, srv_rerror_rate, same_srv_rate diff_srv_rate,  srv_diff_host_rate, dst_host_count dst_host_srv_count, dst_host_diff_src_rate dst_host_same_src_port_rate, dst_host_srv_diff_host_rate dst_host_serror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, dst_host_rerror_rate dst_host_srv_rerror_rate  One attribute is added as class which is 42nd attribute. There are two types of class called Normal and Anomaly. Anomaly class can be further divided into DOS, PROBE, R2L and U2R as shown in table 2.

 VII  C ONCLUSION   In recent years, by spread of using the Internet, need of information security has been felt more than ever to prevent personal and confidential information from unauthorized intrusion. The different approaches introduce for intrusion detection.In this paper presents a hybrid approach to anomaly detection using of K-means clustering and Sequential Minimal Optimization \(SMO\n. The solution specifically addresses issues that arise in the context of large scale datasets. It uses feature selection in preprocessing phase to reduce the number of dataset, The Consistency SebsetEvel and Genetic search algorithms have been applied to select specific features from the NLS-KDD dataset and remove those features which are irrelevant before clustering and classifi cation phases, and also it used k-means clustering to reduce th e size of the training dataset while maintaining. After that in classification phase supervised algorithm called Sequential Minimal Optimization \(SMO\ to improve the quality of detection. A comparison between the proposed approach K-mean + SMO\nd individual algorithm K-mean clustering and Sequential Minimal Optimization \(SMO classification was done, and the results show that our approach outperforms other by a positive detection rate 94.48%\nd reduce the false alarm rate \(1.2%\nd high accuracy \(97.3695 VII  REFERENCES  Kaur  P 2013 Adaptive I n tr usion Detection Based on KSVMeans Algorithm \(Doctoral dissertation, THAPAR UNIVERSITY PATIALA   L e u F Y T s ai K.L   Hsiao Y.T  and Yang C T   2015 An I n ter n al Intrusion Detection and Protection System by using Data Mining and Forensic Techniques  M nz G L i  S and Car l e  G 2007 Septem b e r T r affic ano m aly detection using k-      means cl ustering.

to 81.61 and 83.24 to 84.85 respectively when compared to RMDA For per-class accuracies MRMDA achieves the highest accuracies in ve classes in Table I Fig 7 qualitatively shows the classiÞcation maps of different methods with 5 training pixels from each class In these gures different colors refer to different land covers It is demonstrated that MDA RMDA and MRMDA remove the outliers in the homogeneous regions leading to much smoother classiÞcation maps than the other methods Compared to MDA and RMDA MRMDA obtains the best results in Asphalt and Meadows classes from the visual perspective Tables IIIÐVI list the performance of ten different methods on the KSC and the IP datasets in terms of OA AA 007  and per-class accuracy Similar to the PUS dataset MDA RMDA and MRMDA achieve higher performance than the other FE methods In comparison with MDA RMDA can remarkably improve the OA Besides the performance improvement from RMDA to MRMDA is not signiÞcant as that on the PUS dataset because RMDA has already obtained a high performance and a further increase is relatively difÞcult Nevertheless in terms of per-class accuracy MRMDA achieves higher OAs than RMDA in most classes which also indicates the superiority of the MRMDA IV C ONCLUSION In this paper we have proposed a new model for spatial spectral FE from HSIs Based on the prior knowledge that the pixels in a small spatial neighborhood of the image often lie in a low-rank subspace a denoising model was employed to recover the intrinsic component from the corrupted data The recovered data were then fed into MDA to learn the spatialÐspectral discriminative features Due to the existence of homogeneous regions with different sizes in the image it is difÞcult to choose an optimal scale in MDA To address this issue a new so-called MRMDA model was proposed to combine the complementary information from different scales SpeciÞcally for each pixel multiscale cubes centered at it were extracted and a majority voting strategy was used to fuse the classiÞcation results of these cubes To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model we compared it with several FE methods using three widely used HSIs The obtained results show that RMDA achieves higher performance than MDA and MRMDA can further improve the performance as compared to RMDA Besides we also thoroughly evaluated the effects of different parameters including the window size 003  the reduced dimensions r and c onthe classiÞcation performance R EFERENCES  G  F  H ughes On t he mean accurac y of statistical pattern r ecognizers  IEEE
