INTRODUCTION The rise of new technologies and communication networks that emerged from the internet made it easier to create, use and distribute three-dimensional models. The development of modeling tools, 3D scanners, 3D graphic accelerated hardware Web3D and so on is enabling access to three-dimensional materials of high quality In recent years, many systems have been proposed for efficient information retrieval from digital collections of images and videos. However, the solutions proposed so far to support retrieval of such data are not always effective in application contexts where the information is intrinsically three-dimensional. The 2D/3D shape retrieval methods are 


based on the computation of 2D images rendered from multiple viewpoints, considering that two models are similar when they look similar from all viewing angles. The 3D model is then indirectly represented by various 2D-shape descriptors associated with 2D views so that the 3D-shape matching is transformed into similarity measuring between 2D images Silhouettes and depth-buffer images are the most widespread projections. A silhouette is a binary image whereas a depth buffer image contains the information of the distance between the object and the viewing plane in its pixels In [1], the silhouettes are encoded by their Zernike moments and Fourier descriptors. The dissimilarity between two 3D models is defined as the minimal dissimilarity of the silhouettes over all rotations and all pairs of vertices on the corresponding dodecahedrons. Filali Ansary et al [2] introduce a novel probabilistic Bayesian using a characteristic views selection. Curvature scale space \(CSS  Many of the 2D/3D approaches based on depth images [4, 5, 6 use the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform \(2D-DFT as a 2D-shape signature. They differ mainly in the similarity estimation technique used and in the number of views retained Chaouch et al [5] have introduced a technique to enhance 2D/3D shape descriptors. To take into account the dispersion of information in the views, they associate to each view a relevance index In this paper, we propose a data mining model of 3D object indexing based on 2D views. The goal of this model is to provide a method for optimal selection of 2D characteristic views from a 3D object, and a probabilistic Bayesian method introduced by T. Filali Ansary and all [9] [10][11 object indexing from these views. The data mining model based on Algorithm CHARM[2] for construction .The data mining model is totally independent from the 2D view descriptor used, but the 2D view descriptors should provide some properties. The data mining model has been tested with Zernike Moment 2D descriptors [16 Section 2 describes the different methods of 3D object indexation by views. Section 3 details our approach for characteristic views selection and search 3D object indexing and explains the principle of association rules and its algorithm. Finally, the results obtained from a collection of 3D models are presented for Zernike Moments 2D view descriptor 


showing the excellent performances of our Data mining Model II. METHODS OF 3D OBJECT INDEXATION A. Indexation 2D/3D The methods that use the 3D model views came from psychophysical results which imply that the human visual system represents 3D objects as a group of 2D views rather than a three-dimensional model. The objective of these methods is to search three-dimensional models that are the closest to the 2D image This process can be divided into two phases: an indexation phase and a search phase. In the indexation phase, for each and every three-dimentional model in the base, we determine the characteristic views and their associated vectors using a method of 2D form analysis : : CSS[3], ART[4], Zernike[5][6 etc. Then comes the search phase where the requested image goes through a process similar to views in the base, in which a descriptor is computed and compared to the descriptors of the base The two main issues are the choice of the finest indexation method of 2D views and the choice of the optimum number of views to be taken into account and which views are to be used The selection of the form descriptor of 2D views will not modify the main concept, but it will change the performances and efficiency according to the chosen method In our study, Zernike Moments were chosen to describe characteristic views B. Search of association rules Introduced by Agrawal and al.[7], the searching method of association rules has been proposed to allow us to analyze the supermarket sells to extract rules  such as  : when a customer buys bread and butter, he also buys milk 9 times over 10. As Hbrail suggests [8], even though this association rule concept was developed for marketing purposes, it could also be implemented in another field of research like the research of frequent co-occurrences, pairs or values if the data structure is in accordance with this research III. PROPOSED METHOD A. Properties of the algorithm of selection of characteristic views Now that we have each initial view represented by a vector of Zernike Moments, we wish to reduce this set of vectors to the minimum by removing the redundancies that could have 


been created in a row of BDT \(impossible to see 2 equal views in the same row of a BDT We use the 2 phases of the extraction algorithm of association rules \(described above order to classify the set of views \(the number of classes is unknown and to extract the characteristic view of each class According to CHARM[2], the outcome will be a certain number of groups. Each group will contain a set of minimal reduced views depending on the minimum support threshold These views are the most frequent ones We use the confidence value between the views of the same class to extract the characteristic views of the 3D Object \(one view per class only one that has the minimal confidence value in relation to the sets of views of its class B.

Generation of association rules The association rules that are used here are not limited to the rules which consequences are composed of one single item. To generate the rules, we take into account all non empty sub-sets of f for each frequent itemset of f. And, for each of these subsets h, we return a rule in the form of h => \(f-h support  \(f h threshold  minconf. We evaluate all the sub-sets of f to generate the rules which consequences are the itemsets of size greater than one IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS In order to measure the performance of our algorithms, we used non-complex objects the Princeton benchmark base that is classified into 20 classes depending on their visual similarity The 3D Objects of figure 1 shows examples of 3D objects of different classes In our current implementation, Zernike moments are extracted from views from second order. To compare two Zernike moments, the distance Minkowski order 1 is used Figure 1.  Examples of 3D Objects of different classes The choice of a minimum support and a minimum confidence threshold is justified by the number of experiences For a minsup <50%, we will have enough characteristic views, with unsignificant views among them For a minsup >60%, we will have a small number of characteristic views which represent a limited number of initial views of the 3D object In order to get characteristic views that represents best their class, it is better to choose a minsup that belongs to the interval 48% , 60%], as well as a minimum confidence threshold 


greater than 70 A. Steps of the experiment Example 1: extraction of characteristic views Based on a minimum support of 50% and a minimum confidence threshold of 80%, we tested our method on a 3D object of the class Helicopter. The obtained outcomes are shown in figure 2 Figure 2. Characteristic views of the object  m1312.off Example 2: Research of objects that are similar to the 2D requested view Using a minimum support of 50% and a minimum confidence threshold of 80%, the research of similarity according to our method and the use of probability on a 2D request example produces the outcomes displayed in figure3 Figure 3. 3D objects that are similar to the requested 2D view of class airplane B. Measurement of performance indices For a more accurate analysis of performance, a study in terms of curve \(Recall/Precision be denoted by the following fomula \(Osada     We apply our algorithm  CHARM and Extraction of association rules between views and the Kmeans algorithm over 10 requested views of the same object of the class airplane of the Benchmark base. These views are randomly selected by a program. ie from a 342 views of the object "fighter", Our search algorithm selects a random 10 views queries. Figure 4 displays results comparing Kmeans \(in red algorithm in blue Figure 4. Curves of Recall/ Precision with values of 10 requested views To measure the performance of our algorithm, we applied the two indices of performance mentioned above Figure 4 displays the Recall/Precision curve computed using our algorithm and the Kmeans curve. In this figure, we notice that the accuracy score of the first 35 K \(first third 100% for our suggested method. This means that most of the objects that are similar to the requested object are placed at the top of the search list. And, as of the K greater than 35 \(second thirds which signifies that the rest of the objets \(belonging to the 


same class ranked/placed* as two thirds in the search list. These indices are in accordance with the visual results displayed in Figure 3 On the other hand, the Kmeans algorithm gives a result between 70 and 33% for the first 35K \(first third that the first third of the search list contains a combination of objects: those belonging to the same class as the requested object and others belonging to other classes. Moreover, the K that is greater than 35 corresponds to a score less than 85 which suggests that the rest of the objects belonging to the same class that are similar to the requested object are far from the top of list search V. CONCLUSION In this article, we introduced the concept of 3D object indexation, in particular the indexation from the views of these 3D objects. First, we introduced an algorithm that is independent of the 2D used descriptor in order to extract the characteristic views of a 3D object. The outcomes of this method are very satisfying since this latter reduces the 3D object size \(instead of using 342 initial views, the system automatically reduces this number depending on the threshold of the distance  to a smaller number be characterized by a small number of views called characteristic views. Next, we used the probabilistic bayesian view \(translated by T.F Ansary, J.P. Vandeborred and M Daoudi[5 displayed results highlight the good performances of this method compared to some classical methods of classification This method produces great results when the object size is big enough, with more than 340 views per object These tests are performed based on Princeton Shape benchmark REFERENCES 1] Rakesh Agrawal , Ramakrishnan Srikant, Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, p.487-499 September 12-15, 1994 2] Mohammed J.

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
