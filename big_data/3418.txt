established by frequency of used words which can also be used as the attribute dimension to describe the text While for structured data it can be characterized by the attribute dimensions like item names type deìnitions value ranges record characteristic values etc Although the heterogeneous data with same semantic may have different deìnitions in one or more attribute dimensions but they usually have more similar or even same deìnitions on other ones Automatic clustering mapping of heterogeneous data with same semantic can be realized by the clustering analysis of attribute dimensions To illustrate the processes of clustering based on semantic structured data items are taken as an example of which the basic idea is as the following Assume that there are data items from different data sources each data item has data records and each data record is described by the attribute dimension The data records of item can be denoted as  of which  is the number of attribute dimensions The data records of all data items are described by the same attribute dimensions so the total data records can be described as  Let be the collection of data records in which one is selected randomly as the center then calculate the comprehensive similarity swarm similarity follows deìned between the center and the other records within its neighborhood radius area If the comprehensive similarity is greater than a given threshold  the center is regarded as in the same class with its surrounding records otherwise if the comprehensive similarity is less than the threshold  they are regarded as in different classes and a next record is chosen according to certain strategy After several times of iterations data records are clustered Grouping all data records in a class by data items the clustering accuracy rate CAR can be deìned as the ratio of the number of records of a data item and the number of its all records e.g if records of are clustered into class  the corresponding CAR is  If the CAR is greater than a given threshold  the data item is classiìed to class  Semantic clustering of heterogeneous data items is realized in this way III M ETHOD FOR B IG D ATA S EMANTIC C LUSTERING Data clustering categories data into different clusters whose classes and the number of clusters are closely dependent on related data The accuracy of clustering algorithm is low due to its xed number of clusters Moreover computing time becomes a bottleneck of clustering algorithms in big data environment because they are usually time-consuming This paper proposes an Ant Colony Clustering algorithm MBSC Method for Big Data Semantic Clustering for heterogeneous data using data semantics based on MapReduce which is the distributed parallel computing model of Google The fundamental idea of the algorithm is to divide the data records to be clustered into several data chunks rstly then the independent clustering computing in each data chunk and the parallel computing among the chunks are carried out The process of clustering computing consists of two relatively independent phases and  Parallel computing is realized by embedding the clustering method into multiple independent MapReduce task models Since the data records to be clustered are divided into several data chunks each task is responsible for a data chunk individually and multiple tasks can realize parallel clustering computing for all data chunks the time of clustering algorithm is greatly shorten In each chunk clustering is processed by agent moving Several agents in a task individually complete the clustering moving of a chunk Each agent moves with carrying data records to be clustered for each step certain strategies are used to determine whether to drop the records these data records belong to current class or keep moving If a data record is dropped the agent gets a new record randomly and the current node is set as the new start of the agentês traversal path otherwise the agent updates the length of the traversal path and the path nodes set then continues to move with the data record until the record is dropped or the traversal is complete or the length of the traversal path exceeds the reference value When an agent nishes its traversal and the record it carries has not been dropped yet the task compares and merges the traversal pathes lengths of all agents from all data chunks then obtaining the shortest length in current iteration which becomes the new reference value for clustering computing in each task in the next iteration The iterative process continues after assigning the shortest length to each data chunk until termination criterion is met Since the clusters and the number of cluster can be determined adaptively and automatically based on real data and the clustering center is generated automatically in the iterative process instead of being set in advance this clustering algorithm is much more accurate The clustering computing based on agents in each data chunk is realized by Ant Colony in which data clustering is adaptively achieved by interaction among ant individuals The steps are listed as the following Put the data records to be clustered into an dimension space where is a predeìned attribute dimension number Each record owns a random initial position and can move freely in the dimension space under the impact of ant colony During the moving of a record each ant carries the information of the initial position in the space of the record i.e the values of attribute dimensions of each data record In each step of moving the swarm similarity of the record is evaluated in current local space which is transformed into the probability of dropping or picking up the record by a probability transformation function The massive iterative moving of the ant colony nally makes the data records with similar attributes form a cluster in the same area Swarm similarity is a synthesis similarity of records in a local environment Assume that all the records to be clustered are  is the total number of the records and is the attribute dimension number Let be the space distance between two records and which

TABLE II Comparing of time h consuming of data semantic clustering algorithm the accuracy does not show a linear positive correlation to the data amount with time consumed increasing and is not high on the whole Furthermore with MBSC as the number of tasks increases the increasing rate of clustering efìciency becomes lower though the clustering efìciency itself is still rising For xed data amount when the number of tasks reaches a certain value the clustering efìciency does not increase any more or even begin to decrease at an inîection point Moreover the larger the data amount is the higher clustering accuracy it gets which has nothing to do with the number of tasks indicating data amount is the most essential inîuential factor of clustering accuracy Meanwhile for xed data amount the accuracy increases with the number of does until it reaches to a certain inîection point and turns to decrease and the smaller the data amount is the earlier the inîection point shows In general there is balance between the number of tasks and the data amount approaching which the effect of clustering is better For xed data amount clustering computing efìciency beneìts little from the increasing of the number of tasks with algorithm In addition the clustering accuracy falls as the tasks increases Compared with clustering algorithm even though MBSC consumes more time it gets much higher clustering accuracy The time-consuming difference between MBSC and algorithm becomes smaller while the clustering accuracy difference larger as the number of tasks increases Accuracy per unit time i.e accuracy/time is introduced in order to well compare the effect of the two algorithms For the data amount of 400k the results are shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2 From Fig.1 it can be observed that the proposal spends Fig 1 Time comparison of the two methods Fig 2 Accuracy comparison of the two methods more time than  However as the number of tasks increases the computation time of the proposal becomes close to that of  Fig.2 implies that the accuracy per unit time value of MBSC is better than algorithm when the number of tasks resides between 45 and 60 With the same range of task number it is just the balance interval for the data amount of 400K in Table II and Table III In a word MBSC clustering algorithm is an effective method

Poselet Detector Felzenszwalb et al  Detector CAVIAR 60.26 56.86 BBT 65.99 42.78 Table 4 Tracking accuracy MOTA of the proposed approach using the poselet person detector compared to using the person detector from  5  ple tracks following the same person Person Detector In order to validate our choice of person detector we modi\002ed the proposed tracking approach to support another state-of-the-art object detector by Felzenszwalb et al   5  Results are sho wn in T able 4  Due to the much smaller number of parts in this detector we used the full set of part detectors in the observation model of the modi\002ed approach Particles are scored based on their distance to the closest precomputed person detection and its detection score Occlusion reasoning and appearance model as well as all other aspects of the approach remain the same Similar to the poselet detector the detector from  5  has problems detecting the small persons far in the background of the CAVIAR dataset However persons which are partially occluded or cut off by the lower border of the image are less frequently detected by  5  than by the poselet detector This leads to tracks terminating earlier or more frequently i.e  a higher rate of track misses and correspondingly a slightly lower MOTA On the Big Bang Theory dataset the difference in tracking accuracy is much more signi\002cant The detector form  5  pro vides fe wer or only weak detections in the many cases where only the upper third of a person is visible or persons are in non-pedestrian poses These weak detections often do not suf\002ce to initialize or sustain a track Lowering the corresponding thresholds leads to a large number of false positive tracks on background objects such as plants or lamps and tracks surviving for a long time without presence of a person 6 Conclusion We present a tracking-by-detection approach that combines a particle 002lter with a part-based person detector We use both detection and appearance cues for scoring each track and conduct explicit occlusion reasoning The large number of available part detectors is handled ef\002ciently by a dynamic selection approach which manages a subset of detectors for each track and for track initialization This approach achieves a signi\002cant speed-up while retaining good tracking accuracy We demonstrate consistently high accuracy on two challenging datasets from different domains Our approach does not rely on any scene knowledge and deals well with moving cameras and non-pedestrian body poses Acknowledgments This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF as part of the MisPel program under grant no 13N12063 and as part of the Quaero Program funded by OSEO French State agency for innovation The views expressed herein are the authors responsibility and do not necessarily re\003ect those of OSEO or BMBF References  M Andriluka S Roth and B Schiele Peopletracking-bydetection and people-detection-by-tracking In CVPR  2008  K Bernardin and R Stiefelhagen Ev aluating multiple object tracking performance the clear mot metrics EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing  2008  L Bourde v and J Malik Poselets Body part de tectors trained using 3d human pose annotations In ICCV  2009  M D Breitenstein F  Reichlin B Leibe E K oll er Meier  and L Van Gool Robust tracking-by-detection using a detector con\002dence particle 002lter In ICCV  2009  P  Felzenszw alb D McAllester  and D Ramanan A discriminatively trained multiscale deformable part model In CVPR  2008  C Huang B W u and R Ne v atia Rob ust object tracking by hierarchical association of detection responses In ECCV  2008  M Isard and A Blak e Condensation 226 conditional density propagation for visual tracking IJCV  1998  K J 250 ungling and M Arens Detection and tracking of objects with direct integration of perception and expectation In Int Workshop on Visual Surveillance VS  2009  M Roth M B 250 auml R Nevatia and R Stiefelhagen Robust multi-pose face tracking by multi-stage tracklet association In ICPR  2012  B Y ang C Huang and R Ne v atia Learning af 002nities and dependencies for multi-target tracking using a CRF model In CVPR  2011  B Y ang and R Ne v atia Online Learned Discrimina ti v e P artBased Appearance Models for Multi-Human Tracking In CVPR  2012 49

     Fig 12 Results comparison Planned routes top left Passenger ow comparison of two segments at different frequency top right Opened nightbus routes bottom left Number of delivered passengers at different frequency  R 1 vs R 2  bottom right is motivated by the needs of applying pervasive sensing communication and computing technology for sustainable city development To solve the problem we propose a two-phase approach for night-bus route planning In the rst phase we devise method to identify locations of the candidate bus stops with the passenger pick-ups and drop-offs as inputs In the second phase with the bus route origin destination and candidate bus stops as inputs we develop two heuristic algorithms to automatically generate candidate bus routes and nally we select the best route which expects the maximum number of passengers under the given conditions On a real-world dataset which contains more than 1.57 million passenger delivery trips we compare our proposed candidate bus stop identiìcation method with the popular k means clustering method and show that our method can generate more reasonable and meaningful results We further extensively evaluate our proposed probability based spreading algorithm for automatic bus route generation and validate its effectiveness as well as its superior performance over the heuristic topk spreading algorithm Further more we show the selected night-bus route with our proposed approach is better than a newly started night-bus route-in-service in Hangzhou China This work is among our initial attempts to apply pervasive computing techniques in achieving better urban planning of smart cities With the constraints of the approach and the acquired data this work still has several limitations 1 Human mobility patterns uncovered by taxi GPS traces are biased and incomplete thus the designed bus route might not be the best considering the fact that taxi trafìc does not reîect the whole passenger ow and people taking taxis might not be willing to switch to public transport for various reasons 2 The work makes some assumptions in problem formulation and evaluation for example for bus stop determination we set the walkable distance as 500 meters and the threshold for cluster split and merge is 150 meters apparently the choice of those parameters would affect the results but a study of the parameter sensitivity is not provided due to the space limitation 3 Currently we only explore the issue of designing the best bus route for a given OD pair the proposed approach is still unable to tackle the design of a bus route network In the future we plan to broaden and deepen this work in several directions First we attempt to investigate the optimal bus route design with more real-life assumptions such as varied bus operation frequency and limited bus capacity Second we plan to study the impact of parameter change on the bus route design and the added bus route on the taxi services along the bus route Third we would like to develop practical systems leveraging on taxi GPS traces enabling a series of pervasive smart transportation services A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank the shepherd Dr

15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
