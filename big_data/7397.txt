Introduction  The data mining technologies have been an important technology for discovering previously unknown and potentially useful information from large data sets or databases. They can be  applied to various domains, such as Web commerce, crime reconnoitering, health care, and customer's consumption analysis. However, the technologies can be threats to data privacy. Association rule analysis is a powerful and popular tool for discovering relationships hidden in large data sets. Some private information could be easily discovered by this kind of tools Therefore, the protection of the confidentiality of sensitive information in a database becomes a critical issue to be resolved The problem for finding an optimal sanitization to a database against association rule analysis has been proven to be NP-H h e res earch ca n be di v i ded  into hiding sensitive rules [2-5 d sen s iti v e ite m s 6 8 Vassilio s S.

show that FHSAR outperforms previous works in terms of execution time and side effects generated This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the problem and notations. In Section 3, we describe the main concept of the proposed algorithm and give an illustrative example. Section 4 presents the experimental results, which compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to that of previous works Section 5 is the conclusion  2. Problem Formulation and Notations  In Table 1, we summarize the notations used hereafter in this paper. The support of itemset S can be computed by the following equation support S\|S|| / |D|,                                  \(1 where ||S|| denotes the number of transactions in the database that contains the itemset S, and |D| denotes the number of the transactions in the database D. We call S as a frequent itemset if support\(S  min_support  a given threshold. A transaction t i supports S, if S t i  An association rule is an implication of the form X Y, where X I, Y I and X Y  A rule X Y is strong if 1\upport\(X Y  min_support and 2\fidence\(X Y  min_confidence  where min_support and min_confidence are two given minimum thresholds, and the support\(X Y\d confidence\(X Y\ be computed by the following equations support X Y\ = ||X Y|| / |D|;                   \(2 confidence X Y\|X Y|| / | X |.            \(3 Example 1 An example database is shown in Table 2 There are nine items, |I|=9, and five transactions, |D|=5 in the database. Table 3 shows the frequent itemsets generated from Table 2 for min_support 60%. For the example S = {1,4,7}, since S 1 S 2 and S 3  we obtain ||S||=3. Therefore, support\(1,4,7\ ||S|| / |D 60%. Table 4 shows the association rules generated from Table 2 for min_support 60% and min_confidence 75%. For the example rule 1,4 7 since ||{1,4}|| = 3 and ||{1,4,7}||=3, with the equations 2\d \(3\e can get support\(1,4 7\ 60% and confidence\(1,4 7\00  Our study goal is to completely hide all SAR while minimizing  the side effects generated from the database modification.

The Proposed Algorithms  We now demonstrate the algorithm, FHSAR Given D, SAR min_support and min_confidence The goal of FHSAR is to generate a database to be released D’, in which the sensitive association rules are completely hidden and the side effects generated are minimized. The sketch of the FHSAR algorithm is shown in Figure 2, which can be depicted as the following stages In stage 1, FHSAR scans database once while collects information about the correlation between each transaction and sensitive rules. As shown in Figure 3 the correlation between a transaction, e.g., t 1 and the SAR can be represented by a graph G. Each node is for an item i k in t 1 which can be represented as R k R k   where R k j | SAR j  t i i k SAR j The w i is a prior weight of a transaction t i which provides a heuristic for estimating side effects and can be computed by the formula w i  MIC i 2 t i 1 4 where MIC i max\(|R k  The weight associated with each edge \(u, v\ denotes the number of itemsets in SAR that contain the both items, i.e., i u and i v connected by the edge.

which supports SAR 1 SAR 2 and SAR 3 The correlation between t 1 and SAR is shown in Figure 3.      The node 1, 3}, 2 for item ‘5’ indicates that t 1 supports two sensitive rules, SAR 1 and SAR 3 that contain the item 5’, i.e., R k 1,3} and |R k 2. As shown in Figure 3 max\(|R k max\(3,1,1,2,2\3. Hence, we obtain MIC 1  3 and w 1 3/16  Stage 2 repeats to modify transactions one-by-one until all rules in SAR have been hidden. The order of the modifications is according to the prior weight associated with each transaction. The following tasks are repeated until SAR is empty   Select a transaction t k from PWT such that w k is maximal   Select an item to be deleted, according to the heuristic shown in Figure 4   The function, checking-and-removing Item, shown in Figure 5 is for avoiding hidden failures, That is given any set of SAR, FHSAR is able to completely hide all sensitive association rules in SAR; i.e., U SAR   Compute w k  again after each item modified, and then insert t k into the PWT in the maintained order   Modify ||SAR j and ||L\(SAR j    Remove SAR j from SAR, if SAR j is not still a strong rule Now, we use the following example for illustrating the proposed algorithm FHSAR Example 3 Given D \(in Tables 2\, SAR \(in Tables 5 min_support 40% and min_confidence 60 FHSAR performs the following tasks. First, scan the D and collect information. As shown in Table 6, the SAR j and ||L\(SAR j for each SAR j can be obtained from D and SAR. For example, SAR 3 1,5 7, is supported by t 1 and t 2 so ||SAR 3 2, and L\(SAR 3  1,5}, is supported by t 1 t 2 and t 4 so ||L\(SAR 3 3 Table 7 lists the length, MIC, and the prior weight for each transaction in the database. The PWT, as shown in Table 8, can be obtained by sorting Table 7 in the decreasing order by w Then, the first transaction, i.e t 2 in PWT is chosen to be modified. According the heuristic shown in Figure 4, the item ‘1’ or ‘7 selected randomly\n t 2 is removed. If item ‘1’ is removed, then ||SAR 2 SAR 3 L\(SAR 2 and L\(SAR 3 will be decreased by 1. SAR 3 will be removed from SAR because the \(||SAR 3 D min_support The process is repeated until the SAR is empty. Finally, the FHSAR algorithm removes the item ‘1’ in t 2 the item ‘6’ or ‘8’ \(selected randomly\n t 5 and the item ‘1’ in t 1 Now all sensitive association rules in SAR have been hidden   Table 5.

Performance Evaluation  We have performed two series of experiments on a PC with Pentium III 450 MHz CPU and 256 MB memory, under the Windows 98 operating system. The first series of experiments estimates performance of the FHSAR according to three criteria: CPU time requirements, the side effects generated, and the number of transactions modified. The second series of experiments compares our results with previous works  The IBM data generator [9 i s  use d t o  s ynt he si z e t h e  databases and the Apriori packag o g e n e rat e  rules for the experiments.

The number of entries modified for hiding 5 and 10 rules  The experimental results of FHSAR can be summarized as follows   As shown in Figure 6, the CPU time required for all varied |D| and |SAR| is within 11 seconds. The efficiency is due to only one database scan required in FHSAR   The number of new rules is minimized and independent of the size of database, which can be discovered in Figure 7   The number of lost rules is independent of the size of database, which can be discovered in Figure 8   The number of the modified entries depends on the size of the database and the size of SAR. However since heuristic procedures are used to determine the order of modifications, we can observe in Figure 9 that only a small part of transactions in the database are modified. For the example of |D|=50000, only 3000 transactions are modified for completely hiding the 10 rules in SAR The second series of experiments presents the comparison results to the previous works [2 clu d in g  CPU time, new rules and lost rules.

We can see that the FHSAR is more efficient than others   As shown in Figures 11 and 14, the FHSAR generated less new rules than previous works   In Figures 12 and 15, Although Algorithm 1.a consistently outperforms others, it will generate lots of new rules. The number of new rules generated by Algorithm 1.a is more than 2000, which is outside the range of Figure 14. So, we omit it there  5. Conclusions  In this paper, we have presented the FHSAR algorithm for completely hiding sensitive association rules with limited side effects. In FHSAR, a strategy is developed for avoiding hidden failures. In addition, we propose two heuristic approaches for improving the performance for solving the problem. First, a heuristic function is used to obtain a prior weight for each transaction, by which the order of transactions modified can be efficiently decided. Second, the correlations between the sensitive association rules and each transaction in the original database are analyzed which can effectively select the proper item to modify By using these strategies, FHSAR is able to scan database only once and efficiently to deal with the NPhard problem. The proposed algorithm not only limits the side effects generated, but also guarantees to completely hide all given sensitive rules. Experimental results show that FHSAR outperforms previous works in terms of execution time required and side effects generated in most cases. How to efficiently sanitize sensitive information when the database is updated could be studied in the future. We hope the proposed algorithm could promote the motivation for sharing data among a group of organizations, such as the ISAC j ect    Acknowledgements  This research was supported in part by the National Science Council of ROC under grants NSC 96-3114-P606-002-Y and NSC 96-3114-P- 606-001-Y    References  1  M.

 then we can additionally bound the space by  Furthermore since the frontier contains all uncompleted  and n n n  This is for the worst case when all itemsets are frequent Clearly a closer bound is if we let 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 itemvectors of space Furthermore 2    n n          b  212  b   The cardinality of both these sets equal to the number of nodes along the path is 942  001 001 001 001 be the largest itemset GLIMIT uses at most 001  007  100  n 1 1 1 1  t\212 n is even the last node is t   t t  b 3 1 t\212 l l l l step 006 n 2 n   n n n minSup 1 1  6 Experiments even or odd b 002 1 and up in the tree we are the more this contributes Secondly we need to keep itemvectors in memory until we complete their respective nodes That is check all their children Fact 6 or if they can\325t have children Fact 5 Now the further we are up in the tree or any subtree for that matter without completing the node the longer the sequence of incomplete nodes is and hence the the more itemvectors we need to keep Considering both these factors leads to the situation in Figure 3 320 that is we are up to the top item and the topmost path from that item so that no node along the path is completed If we have corresponding to the single items children of the root There are a further inclusive to the last coloured node these are the uncompleted nodes 16  Therefore the total space required is just is so that we do not double count the itemvector for  is low and in practice with non-pathological support thresholds we use far fewer than itemvectors If we know that the longest frequent itemset has size 16 When directly into As an aside note we could perform the transpose operation in memory before mining while still remaining within the worst case space complexity However on average and for practical levels of objects Algorithm 1 describes 17 the additional types we use such as items respectively To apply GLIMIT we 336rst transpose the dataset as a preprocessing step 19  We compared GLIMIT to a publicly available implementation of FP-Growth and Apriori We used the algorithms from ARtool 20 as it is written in 17 The pseudo-code in our algorithms is java-like and we assume a garbage collector which simpli\336es it Indentation de\336nes blocks and we ignore type casts 18 http://\336mi.cs.helsinki.\336/data 19 This is cheap especially for sparse matrices 320 precisely what the datasets in question typically are Our data was transposed in 8 and 15 seconds respectively using a naive Java implementation and without using sparse techniques 20 http://www.cs.umb.edu laur/ARtool It was not used via the supplied GUI The underlying classes were invoked directly itemvectors itemvectors along the path from node  We have sketched the proof of Lemma 2 Let  and shows the initialisation and the main loop 320 which calls methods used by We evaluated our algorithm on two publicly available datasets from the FIMI repository 18 320 T10I4D100K and T40I10D100K These datasets have  where the be the number of frequent items Hence we need space linear in the number of frequent items The multiplicative constant  method whereby a list priority queue of states each containing a node that has yet to be completely expanded is maintained The general construct is to retrieve the 336rst state evaluate it for the search criteria expand it create some child nodes and add states corresponding to the child nodes to the frontier Using different criteria and frontier orderings leads to different search techniques Our frontier contains any nodes that have not yet been completed wrapped in is odd it is  5     n y  1  3  5 n 212 3 n 212 1  items the worst case itemvector usage is just the number of coloured nodes in Figure 3 There are  n i  Note that in the even case the next step to that shown will use the same memory the itemvector for node t\212 2 y  1  3  5 n 212 3 n 212 1 n  frontier is no longer needed once we create  and when 3 5 3 5 3 5 5 3 n n 1 1 as we compute it so both need never be in memory at the same time nodes we know from the above that its upper bound is 3 It also describes the 3 step Figure 3 Maximum number of itemvectors Two cases   n   n   n   n 267 267 267 267 n 000 870 minM easure n be the number of frequent items Let b State State    n n n y n n n l n n be the number of items and n l calculateF  check 212 212 212   212 212 212 212  by Fact 6 and we write i eg  this would require more memory The algorithm is a depth 336rst traversal through the Pre\336xTree Any search can be implemented either recursively or using the frontier transactions and a realistic skewed histogram of items They have  n b

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
