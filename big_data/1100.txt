Automatic Content-Based Recommendation in e-Commerce CHEN Jian YIN Jian HUANG Jin Department of Computer Science Zhongshan University Guangzhou GD 510275 China ellachen@163.com Abstract The amount of information in e-Commerce is increasing far more quickly than our ability to process Recommender systems apply knowledge discovery techniques to help people nd what they really want However all of the previous approaches have an important drawback items added newly cannot be found In this paper a general framework 
is proposed for supporting automatic recommendation of the new item to the potential users based on the concept of inﬂuent sets We propose a simple efﬁcient indexing structure and a heuristic information retrieval technique algorithm for searching reverse k nearest neighbour in highdimensional dataset And experimental evaluation reveals that our approach outperforms the previous algorithm and enhances the performance efﬁciently 1 1 Introduction 
With the rapid development of e-Commerce and its increased popularity ease-use tools the world is becoming more and more a global marketplace But the amazing number of news advertisements and other information of products in e-Commerce sites makes us feel it is necessary to nd some new technologies that can dramatically reduce the useless information and help us sift through all the available information to nd which is most valuable to us Recommender system is one of these technologies by identifying 
particular items that are likely to match each user’s tastes or preferences Some of most widely used technologies for building recommender systems include collaborative ltering CF 1 1 This work is supported by the Na tional Natural Science Foundation of China 60205007 Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province 031558 04300462 Research Foundation of National Science and Technology Plan Project 2004BA721A02 Research Foundation of Science and Technology Plan Project in Guangdong Province 2003C50118 and Research Foundation of Science and Technology Plan Project in Guangzhou City 2002Z3-E0017

discover them This is generally referred to as the new item problem How can potential users nd these new items as soon as possible How a new CD album be recommended in good time to the real customers who seem to have special favor on it In practice many new items are added into the e-Commerce sites every minute hour or day In this paper we propose a general framework aiming at solving this problem A new query mechanism is explored to automatically recommend the new items to those users that seem to have the similar tastes or interests matching with the content 
features of this item The rest of the paper is organized as follows We rst describe the general framework of our automatic recommender system and its key components in section 2 Section 3 gives the theoretical foundation of reverse k nearest neighbour and the basic structure of our indexing tree RkNN-Tree  In section 4 we report the experiment results for applying our new algorithm to different high-dimensional datasets We give the conclusion in section 5 2 A Framework of Automatic Recommender 
System for New Item Recently more and more attentions have been paid on users taste and preference to improve the retrieval process in order to generate more meani ngful and suitable retrieval results for users And in real world users may want to require the newest relevant information as soon as it appears Compared to those passive information acquirement models 


such as search agents our active information acquirement model can dramatically save much time for people who are always busy in this information exploded age In our automatic recommender system we divide the users into groups who appear to have similar preferences according they accessed similar content in Internet Semantic content features of a new item will be extracted to match the format of feature vector database After adding it to database we provide an efﬁcient way to calcu late and retrieval the similarities/distances between the feature vectors of new item and users clusters Actually it is a process to nd inﬂuent sets of new item which can be accomplished by a reverse k nearest neighbour query Finally this item will be recommended to these groups of users that seem to have the similar tastes or interests matching with the semantic content feature of this item  Site Database Content Features Extraction Features Vectors Database Users Database Users Interest Clustering Users Cluster Interest Features Descriptions Content Features Extraction Reverse k Nearest Neighbor Search Automatically Recommend New Item Figure 1 Architecture of recommender system on content-based retrieval Pages texts scripts and images etc are stored in a large database Through content features extraction those information are formalized by a series of feature vectors which map individual instances to points in a high dimensional 2.1 Extracting Semantic Features from Pageviews In Web applications Pagevie ws are semantically meaningful entities such as items  Through content features extraction each pageview p can be represented as a k dimensional feature vector where k is the total number of extracted features from the site in a global dictionary Each dimension in a feature vector represents the corresponding feature weight within the pageview Thus the feature vector for a pageview p is given by p   fw  p f 1  fw  p f 2    f w  p f k   where is fw  p f j  the weight of the j th feature in pageview p forsome j  1,...,k   2.2 Extracting Semantic Features from User Transactions We take feature extraction method from user transactions database described by Dai and Bamshad Mobasher in 5 User transactions are relevant subsets of pageview in each user session Data preparation results in a set of n pageviews P   p 1 p 2   p n  and a set of m user transactions T   t 1 t 2   t m  where each t i  T with a unique identiﬁer TID is a subset of P  Each transaction t was viewed as an l dimensional vector over the space of pageviews reference t   w  p 1 t  w  p 2 t    w  p l t   where each p  P for some i  1 n  and w  p i t  is the weight associated with pageview p in the transaction t representing its signiﬁcance The weights can be determined in a number of ways meeting the demand Content mining may use a function of the duration of the associated pageview in order to capture the user’s interest in a content page Thus the set of all user transaction can be viewed as an m  n transaction-pageview matrix denoted by TP  For the whole collection of pageviews in the site we have the n  k pageview-feature matrix PF   p 1 p 2 p n   Then if we map each pageview of PF in a transaction t i to one or more content features we can get a new matrix TF   t  1 t  2 t  m  where t  i   fw  t  i f 1  fw  t  i f 2    f w  t  i f k   each t  i is a k dimensional vector over the feature space and fw  t  i f j  is the weight of the j th feature in transaction t  i  for some j  1 k   Thus a user transaction can be represented as a content featur e vector reﬂecting that user’s interests in particular concepts or topics 2.3 User Clustering based on Similar Interest The use of clustering in information retrieval is base on the Clustering Hypothesis closely associated things tend to be relevant to the same request According to the hypothesis if we do good job at clustering similar or non-similar users we would have enhance the chance of improving the quality of recommendation Based on the above matrix TF  we deﬁne a measure for the similarity/distance between users Suppose TF A   t a 1 t a 2 t ak  and TF B   t b 1 t b 2 t bk  are transactionfeature matrix of user A and user B respectively Dist  A B  sim  A B   k i 1  sup  f ai  sup  f bi    k i 1 sup 2  f ai  sup 2  f bi  where sup  f ai  is support of feature sup  f ai  in the matrix TF A  that is the occurrence frequency of feature sup  f ai  in the matrix TF A and sup  f ai  has the same meaning of sup  f ai   We accomplished the users clustering in the process of building our indexing structure RkNN-Tree which will be introduced in detailed in next section 


 New Item Figure 2 Users clustering based on their transactions similarities 2.4 Recommending New Item to Users Clusters by the Concept of Inﬂuent Sets K Nearest Neighbor  kNN  problem is an important topic in real work applicati ons and research domains such as in information retrieval multimedia systems spatial databases and data mining etc Recently more and more attentions have been paid on its reverse version which is known as Inﬂuence Sets problem The Reverse k Nearest Neighbor problem is to nd all points in a data set that take a given query point as one of their k Nearest Neighbor 6 Thi s notion arises in examples such as nding the set of customers affected by the opening of a new store outlet location or deciding the service scope managed by a certain call center etc  In our case recommender system will notify the subset of Web users who will nd a newly added item most relevant Based on the inherent information of different user clusters we can nish the recommendation of new item to the right user clusters just by performing a simple reverse k nearest neighbor query which take the feature vector of new item as a query vector The results returned are a set of users who have the similar tastes or interests matching with the content features of this item In what follows we will describe this in detailed 3 Reverse k Nearest Neighbor Query Firstly we give the formal deﬁnitions of these two problems Let S denote a set of n feature vectors v  and let Dist   d  d   0 is denoted as the similarity/distance measure function which given in subsection 2.3 For a query feature vector q  and a query parameter k  1  Deﬁnition 1 The k Nearest Neighbor of q is deﬁned as kNN  q   S   S   S  v 1  S   v 2  S  Dist  q v 1  012 Dist  q v 2   with  S    k 012 n  Deﬁnition 2 The Reverse k Nearest Neighbor of q is deﬁned as RkN N  q   v  S  q  kNN  v   What is worthy of notice is RkNN  q  may be empty or have one or more elements Lemma 3 v  RkN N  q   q  kNN  v  Proof This is obvious regarding the deﬁnitions of kNN and RkNN  Corollary 4 Suppose kNN v is the distance between v and its k Nearest Neighbor Dist  v q  012 kNN v  v  RkN N  q  Dist  v q  kNN v  v  RkN N  q  Proof If Dist  v q  012 kNN v then q is a kNN or is a tie of kNN of v  According Theorem 1 v is RkNN of q  Otherwise v is NOT RkNN of q and vice versa Notice k nearest neighbor and reverse k nearest neighbor are not symmetric That is q  kNN  v  015  q  RkN N  v  and vice versa q s t r u Figure 3 k nearest neighbor and reverse k nearest neighbor are not symmetric According to the deﬁnition 1 and 2 2 NN  q   r t   R 2 NN  q   r s t u  So RkN N  q  will return empty or have k or more than k elements 3.1 Challenges on Reverse k Nearest Neighbor Query in High-Dimension Traditional clustering techniques generally have bad accuracy and low performance for very large-scale problems Because the number of features in a transaction vector usually is in tens to a few hundreds in typical applications Some techniques like SVD 10 ha v e been w i del y us ed to increase density and reduce the dimensionality of highdimensional feature space However in many cases the resulting from reducing the dimensionality will still have a quite large dimensionality And the remaining dimensions are all relatively important which means that any efﬁcient indexing method must guarantee a good selectivity on all those dimensions In high-dimensional spaces the case of RNN would be much more complicated with dimension growing The extended property in 8 becomes  for a n y query poi nt q  RNN\(q will return at most 6 data points in a 2-dimensional data space and 12 in 3-dimensions In addition this number 


will increase exponentially with increase in dimensionality In the L  case the cardinality of RNN\(q is at most 3 d 1 in d dimensions The exponential increase in the number of RNN with the increase in dimensions makes all current algorithms for searching RNN practically impossible and infeasible for higher dimensions because number of searching space would be very h igh Furthermore the exiting approaches for kNN queries in high-dimension such as X-Tree VA-File and IQ-Tree can not be adapted to RkNN queries directly because of k nearest neighbor and reverse k nearest neighbor are not symmetric directly 3.2 Structure of RkNN-Tree Based on the above studies we e developed the RkNNTree  which is a new heuristic indexing techniques based on a simple yet efﬁcient algorithm to search both kNN and RkNN in high-dimensional datasets By using the RkNNTree to reorganize the dataset S and utilizing its heuristic information in directory node to implement indexing query we can achieve a good experimental performance in highdimensional datasets Figure 4 The structure of RkNN-Tree In our RkNN-Tree  a leaf node is a 2-element vector  v ptr k dist  where v ptr refers to a feature vector v in the d  dimensional dataset and k dist is the distance from v to its k nearest neighbor in the dataset A directory node contains an n 2 array of branch of the form  Child ptr MBS max k dist  Child ptr is an array of n points referring to its child nodes in the tree There are two cases  If Child ptr points to a leaf node then MBS is the minimum sphere region containing all of data node in this leaf And max k dist  max  k dist  all Leaf in this directory node  If Child ptr points to a directory node then MBS  max  MBS  child directory node And max k dist  max  max k dist  child directory node In our approach the indexing structure using minimum bounding spheres MBSs instead of minimum bounding rectangles MBRs to represent the shape of regions has two reasons First the diameters of region will affect the performance of query sensibly Diameters of MBRs diagonals are longer than that of MBSs To distribute data points into smaller region can help reduce the overlapping of regions and improve the performance of query Second the storage of a sphere just has a center 1 DATA type and a radius 1 oat type while a rectangle needs two diagonal points 2 DATA type to represent it In high-dimensional data spaces the former make itself outstanding by saving about half storage space in contrast of the latter 3.3 Storage and Search Strategies For disk-resident databases the number of blocks which must be accessed is taken as a measure of the amount of I/O and hence a cost of queries Therefore current studies of disk-resident indexing techni ques mainly focus on reducing the cost of page access it has been notice that minimization of page access doesn’t lead to the optimization of CPU response time because the time for a disk access includes the data transfer time as well as the disk seek time which turns out to be more expensive than the previous one Under the observations we take the strategy of storing the page in the same level of tree continuously which is different from the previous methods That means all pages including the nodes in the same level of tree will be saved in a continuous memory physical space And to take the advantage of the property of continuous storage strategy we change the traditional Depth-First Traversal mode to Breadth-First Traversal mode The BFT mode traverses the tree level by level and takes more advantage of the disk buffer and gains higher disk transfer rate The successive pages can be prefetched into the disk buffer to reduce the number of physical accesses to disk when the bus is busy We insert all users into the RkNN-Tree one by one according their representing feat ure vectors In this process we keep the heuristic information for each node such as MBS etc Once the requirement of searching reverse k nearest neighbor for some query vector q  from the root of RkNN-Tree  the algorithm must determine which branches should be travelled or pruned under the current directory node The aim of a good search strategy is to reduce the number of node that must be travelled to the least The best travel order is not only dependent on the distance from q to each MBS from the root to the leaf but also determined by the size of MBS and the layout of each sub-MBS So before starting the sear ch we calculate MINDIST  q n  between q and the MBS of current node n and generate an ABL Active Branches List whose points refer to an ordered branches list according these MINDISTs Then the algorithm judge whether MINDIST  q n  greater than the eld max k dist  if yes that means none of vectors under 


this directory node would take q as its k nearest neighbor So this branch can be pruned and all nodes under it would not be traveled Experiment evaluation shows these strategies can improve search performance dramatically 3.4 Reverse k Nearest Neighbor Query Algorithm Algorithm 1 Reverse k Nearest Neighbor Query Algorithm 1 RkN N    2 n  S   3 rknn num  0  4 if current node p is a leaf node then 5 temp k dist  Dist  q p  6 if temp k dist 012 p.k dist then 7 RkN N  rknn num  p  8 rknn num  rknn num 1  9 end if 10 end if 11 if current node d is a directory node then 12 genBranchList q  branchList ABL 13 sortBranchList\(branchList 14 for i  1 d.num do 15 temp k dist  MINDIST  q d.b i M BS  16 if temp k dist 012 d.b i max k dist then 17 RkNNQuery d.b i child ptr q  18 end if 19 end for 20 end if Notice that k nearest neighbor queries can still be accomplished efﬁciently the same as that in traditional R*-Tree[7  3.5 The Maintenance of the RkNN-Tree The RkNN-Tree is dynamic and can be updated incrementally The processes of insertion deletion and update can be completed easily by si mply combining several kNN and RkNN query operations We rst take a look at insertion When a point v  is to be inserted into a generated RkNN-Tree  We perform a kNN search operation to nd its kNN v   and create the form v k dist v   which is required in leaf node Next an RkNN query can give us the information of those points that are affected i.e RkNN\(v For each v i  RkN N  v   we recomputed its k dist v i by perform kNN\(v i  and the eld MBS and max k dist of its ascendant nodes will also need to be adjusted up to the root of the tree This can be done in a way very similar to the RkNN query algorithm At last we insert v  the same as in a normal R*-tree Now we turn our attention to deletion Firstly we nd the target point v  to delete and remove it from the appropriate leaf L Just like insertion operation those affected points in RkNN\(v must be found and recomputed their kNN and the relevant directory nodes must be adjusted The update operation is composed of two steps after a deletion operation insertion supervenes 4 Experimental Evaluation Since there is no other reverse k nearest neighbor algorithms were given in the published literature we choose the straightforward algorithm introduced in 6 w hi ch  nds reverse k nearest neighbor by a sequentially scan through all the vector database and determine those vectors v that make q falling into its precomputed Circle  v k dist v  that means have q as their k nearest neighbor We conduct a set of experiments to analyze response time and page accesses of RkNN queries under different dimension and size datasets All experiments were perform on a C Pentium 4  CPU 1.7G running Linux Ret Hat 9 with 528MB of main memory and 15GB of disk All programs have been implemented in standard C and use double oat data type The block size used for our experiment is 4KByte and all indexing structures were allowed to use the same amount of cache We measured both total CPU response time as well as page accesses 4.1 Effect of the Size of Datasets Let us rst compare how the RkNNQuery perform on various size datasets which include 5 uniform distributed datasets of x dimension 8 and various dataset sizes 50K 75K 100K 125K and 150K We also randomly generated a set of 500 queries for evaluating the searching performance of RkNNQuery and RkNNScan  We observed that the former is obviously faster than the latter when datasets is small As datasets size increases RkNNScan have to computer more distances between query point and data point while special tree structure and heuristic search strategies of RkNNTree give more wise advices to its query algorithm costing less response time and page access  0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 25 50 75 100 125 150 Datasets Size\(K Response Time\(s RkNNQuery RkNNScan Figure 5 Comparisons on Response Time on Different Datasets Size

Structural Model  After the measurement model specification, we analyze the structural model. The squared multiple correlations \(R 2 xpress the significance of the four endogenous variables. The corresponding t-values show the level of significance using the magnitude of the standardized parameter estimates between constructs. The path coefficients in the research model are significant as shown in Figure 2  The explanatory power of the R≤ is classified by Chin bs t a n t i a l e x pres s i v en e s s f o r t h e  research model could be estimated by an R≤ over 0.67. An average effect stands for R≤-values between 0.67 and 0.34. The explanatory power is weak for an R≤ between 0.34 and 0.19 and overall not relevant for R≤-values under 0.19 [1    Figure 2: Structural model validation   Therefore R≤ of our research model for the intention to use self- and e-assessment can be categorized as substantial expressive for perceived usefulness and as an average effect for intention  4.4. Results  The results of our empirical research based on our explorative case study is that the intention to use self and e-assessments can be explained by Davis perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use Furthermore antecedents of perceived usefulness are perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings derived of the MATH e ll as th e [36]. Statistical  support can be provided for all the hypothesized relations between constructs except of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness  5. Limitations  As with any work in a new field of research relevant literature about self- and e-assessments to build on is almost nonexistent. Unfortunately the operationalization of "perceived cost and time savings" as well as perceived quality improvements  in this paper could consequently not build on earlier work too much so we had to derive them of the MATH m  w e ll as t h e UT A U T  36   As with any empirical field study, this work has limitations. It is important to note that we have build an explorative model to examine the acceptance of self- and e-assessments.

So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
