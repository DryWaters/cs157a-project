How do Consumer Personality Traits affect their Perceptions and Evaluations of Service Quality Xiucheng Fan Yanyan Du Dept of Marketing, Fudan University Dept of Marketing, Fudan University Shanghai China Shanghai China xcfan@fudan.edu.cn  062025108@fudan.edu.cn Abstract-One of the challenges in service evaluation measurement is how to quantify service quality perceptions so that businesses can use these 
measures to benchmark their service performances  This study demonstrates the need to weigh customers  service perceptions based on their inherent characteristics such as personality traits These findings challenge the adequacy of the traditional method of service evaluation measurement And the significance of this study lies in its potential to contribute to an improved model of conceptualizations and operationalization 
of perceptions of service quality and consequently more comprehensive knowledge about customers  perceptions of service quality and its consequences Keywords-Personality Traits Big-Five Factors Service Quality Perceptions satisfaction word of mouth   INTRODUCTION Since the 1980s researchers in the field of service marketing have almost noted that the good service quality will influence positively on the attitude emotion and behavior of customers 
so keeping high-level service quality which can bring both economical and social effects for organization is the most important strategy of firm for consistent development Gronroos 1984 Parasuraman Berry and Zeithaml 1985 Cronin and Taylor 1992 etc Therefore more and more researchers recently turned their study interests to the topic about service quality their studies were majorly about the antecedents and consequences of service quality Service quality 
is the perception of consumers on service supplied by service providers thus this construct is abstract and subjective Many researchers began to find the mechanisms and dimensions that compose service quality so that to obtain the exact measurement of the core constructs in service marketing Cronin and Taylor 1992 Parasuraman Berry and Zeithaml 1988 Mels Gerhard Christo Boshoff and Deon Nel 1997 The limitations of the traditional service 
evaluation method have been noted by many researchers and a series of measurements have been developed based on different conceptualizations of service quality and satisfaction Researchers Cronin  Taylor 1992 Teas 1993 have questioned the validity and reliability of the gap model suggesting that measuring perceptions alone might provide a better indication of service quality than measuring the difference between expectations and perceptions A scale called SERVPERF was 
then developed by Cronin and Taylor in 1992 Researchers in their recent studies have considered a little about how the individual differences among customers to affect their perception of service There is an emerging body of research in the marketing and tourism literatures that demonstrates the need to weigh customers  service evaluations based on their inherent characteristics such as gender cultural background and personality traits For example 
gender bias was found on perceived service fairness Snipes Thomson and Oswald 2006 These findings challenge the adequacy of the traditional method of service evaluation measurement It calls for more studies to

investigate the inherent characteristics of customers that contribute to their service evaluations   THEORIES and PROPOSITIONS A Personality traits For many years traits occupied a central position in personality theory There were debates about the number of meaningful traits Cattell 1957 Eysenck 1953 1978 arguments as to whether they should be seen as general or unique to the individual Allport 1937 1961 Many psychologists are now convinced that the best representation of trait structure is provided by the five-factor model FFM Digman 1990 According to the FFM most personality traits can be described in terms of five basic dimensions called Extraversion or Surgency E Agreeableness versus Antagonism A Openness to Experience or Intellect Imagination or Culture O and Conscientiousness or Will to Achieve C Neuroticism versus Emotional Stability N These dimensions can be found in trait adjectives as well as in questionnaires created to operationalize a variety of personality theories McCrae  John 1992 The Revised NEO Personality Inventory NEO-PI-R Costa  McCrae 1992 was developed to operationalize the FFM by assessing 100 specific facets 20 items for each factor and the values of Cronbach  s  which reflect the reliabilities of the scales are between 0.82 and 0.97 For the reason of simplification and its convenient use the factor structure of these 100 scales then was cut short to 40 words scales 8 adjectives for each factor Saucier 1994 For the purpose of our study we used the simplified 40 words scales to measure the personality traits of customers who accept service which based on our proposition that personality traits are strong linked to the evaluation of service performance B Service quality Because of three particular service characteristics intangibility heterogeneity and inseparability service quality is more difficult to evaluate directly than goods quality Service marketing scholars defined service quality as a comparison of consumer expectations with actual service performance Lewis and Booms 1983 Gronroos 1982 developed a model in which he indicated that consumers compare their expectations of the service with the perceptions of the service they receive while evaluating service quality And also Parasuraman Berry and Zeithaml 1985 1988 have made distinguished contribution to the understanding and definition of the construct of service quality Parasuraman  Zeithaml and Berry 1988 have established a multi-item scale of measuring customer perception of service quality  SERVQUAL through a series of exploratory and confirmatory researches This SERVQOUAL scale consists of 5 dimensions which are tangibility reliability responsiveness assurance and empathy Tangibility Physical facilities equipment and appearance of personnel Reliability Ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately Responsiveness Willingness to help customers and provide prompt service Assurance Knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to inspire trust and confidence Empathy Caring individualized attention the firm provides its customers Our study have used a 13-item scale to measure customer perception of service quality and this scale was developed by Cho 2006 just based on SERVQUAL and studies from existing literature It measures three dimensions of service quality responsiveness assurance and reliability of the service C Satisfaction and WOM Customer satisfaction describes the whole attitude of customer after experiencing the service it can reflect the degree that customer like or dislike the service Woodside Frey and Daly 1989 Mos t of satisfaction researches have focused on the disconfirmation of

expectations as the key determinant of satisfaction e.g Cardozo 1965 Oliver 1980 Oishavsky and Miller 1972 Olson and Dover 1979 They described satisfaction as  customer attitudes brought by the consistence between their previous expectations and subsequent perceptions of service performance  Since service quality is a construct defined as  difference between service performance and customer expectation  thetwoconstructsof service quality and customer satisfaction achieved much attention of scholars as a couple of antecedent and consequent variables Bitner 1990 Bolton  Drew 1991 Cronin  Taylor 1992 Word of mouth WOM will be created when customer has the satisfied evaluation of the service quality perception after experiencing service Danaher  Rust 1994 and Dabholkar 1996 suggested that WOM should be linked with service quality Service quality influences customer satisfaction level and satisfying customer will give good WOM about the service they have purchased Customer satisfaction is recognized to be the key determinant of positive word of mouth File  Prince 1992 and Yi 1990 Satisfied customers would like to keep touch with service providers and the relationship between them will lead to customer loyalty which consists of WOM and repurchase behavior Hallowell  1996 Evidence from the literature suggests that ratings of service performance may not be indicative of actual service quality but more an indication of respondents  inherent characteristics such as gender and their cultural orientations Cho  s 2006 study provided initial evidence that people with different personality traits may have different service evaluation although the service performance is the same These findings challenge the adequacy of the traditional method of service evaluation measurement It calls for more studies to investigate the inherent characteristics of customers that contribute to their service evaluations And customers  inherent characteristics that are not related to the service must be identified and controlled before a more accurate measurement can be developed Such effort is scarce in the marketing literatures and existing empirical evidence is limited In our study we postulate that P1 Evaluations of service quality are influenced by the personality traits of customers such as extraversion agreeableness openness conscientiousness neuroticism P2 The relationships between service quality and customer satisfaction are moderated by the personality traits of customers P3 The relationships between customer satisfactionandtheirwordofmouthare moderated by the personality traits of customers  DATAandRESULTS A Sampling and Data collection Convenience sampling was used to select samples for the research The population for this study is undergraduate students at Fudan University China The sample size of participants is 300 This sample size is determined based on the statistical analyses will be conducted for the study The response rate is 84.67 254 complete questionnaires are available 105 of which are from male and 149 are from female The scenario approach will be used to collect data The same video clip used in Cho  s 2006 study was played for participants with the intention of providing an identical service experience for all the participants The questionnaire was designed in English and the back-translation method Werner  Campbell 1973 will be utilized to translate the questionnaire and video clip to Chinese To ensure quality and objectivity a professional translation service will be hired to conduct the translation of both the questionnaire and the

customer satisfaction and word of mouth WOM have been widely documented in the past researches Researchers universally agreed that service quality is a determinant of customer satisfaction and satisfied customers will have positive word of mouth However our study indicated that customer personality traits would affect the impacts of service quality on customer satisfaction Good service quality would not always make satisfied customers while customers of different personality traits will have different attitudes even the same service quality For example when customers are less extroversive agreeable conscientious and neurotic the positive relationship between the evaluation of overall service quality and customer satisfaction is stronger While the effect of customer satisfaction on WOM is so stable that it cannot be moderated by customer personality traits which make it certain that customer satisfaction is a key determinant of WOM or customer loyalty R EFERENCES 1 B ar r i c k M R  M o unt MK  T he B i g F i v e P e r s o n a l i t y Dimensions and Job Performance a Meta Analysis[J  Personality Psychology 1991 44 pp. 1  26 2 B o l to n  R u t h N  a n d J a m e s H  D r e w  A M u l tiS t a g e Model of Customers Assessments of Service Quality and Value[J  J o u r n al of C ons um e r R e s e ar ch  1 7 M a r c h   pp.375-384 3 C ho  M  J   2006  T he R e l a t i ons hi p b e t w een Customers  Personalities and Their Evaluation of Service Quality A Master  s Thesis University of Missouri-Columbia 4 C o s t a P T  J r  M c Cra e RR  T h e N E O P I  N EO F F I manual supplement Odessa FL Psychological Assessment Resources 1989 5 C r o ni n J  J   a n d T a yl or  S  A  M ea s u r i ng S e r v i c e Quality A Reexamination and Extension[J  J o u r n a l o f Marketing 1992 56 pp 55-68 6 D i g m a n J M I n o u ye J  F u r t he r S pec i f i c a t i on of t h e Five Robust Factors of Personality[J  J ou r n a l o f P e r s o n a l i t y  Social Psychology 1986 50\(1 pp 116  123 7 G r o nr oos  A Se r v i c e Q ual i t y M ode l a n d I t s M ar ket i n g Implications[J  E u r ope an J o ur n a l o f M ar ke t i ng  1984 18 4  pp 36-44 8 L i o u  T  S   a n d C h e n  C  W  S u b je c t iv e A p p r a is a l o f Service Quality using Fuzzy Linguistic Assessment[J  International Journal of Quality  Reliability Management 2006 23\(8 928-943 9 M cC ar t h y  M  S  and F r a m  E  H   A n E xp l o r a t o r y Investigation of Customer Penalties Assessment of Efficacy Consequences and Fairness perceptions  Journalof Services Marketing 2000 14\(6 pp 479-89  M e l s  G e r h a r d  C h r i s t o B o s hof f  a n d D eon N e l  T he Dimensions of Service Quality The Original European Perspective Revistited[J  S e r v i ce I n d u s t r i es J o ur n a l  1997 17\(1 pp.173-189  M i c h a e l K  B r a dy and J  J os e p h C r o n i n J r   S o m e N ew Thoughts on Conceptualizing Perceived Service Quality A Hierarchical Approach[J  J o ur n a l o f M ar ke t i ng   J u l y 2001  65 pp 34-49  P a r a s u r a m a n  V  A  Z e i t h a m l  a nd L  L  B e r r y  A Conceptual Model of Service Quality and Its Implications for Future Research[J  J o ur n a l o f M ar k e t i ng  v o l  49 F a l l 1985 pp.41-50 13 P a ra s u ra m a n  V  A  Z e i t h a m l  a n d L  L B e rry  SERVQOAL A Multiple-Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality[J  J o u r n a l o f Retailing 64\(Spring 1988 pp.12-40 14 S a u c ie r  G   M in iM a r k e r s  A b r i e f v e r s i o n o f Goldberg  s unipolar Big-Five Markers Journal of Personality Assessment 1994 63\(3 506-516 15 S n i p e s R  L   T h o m s o n  N  F  a n d O s w a l d S  L   Gender Bias in Customer Evaluations of Service Quality An Empirical Investigation[J  J o u r na l o f S e r vi c e s M a r k e t i ng  2006 20\(4 274-284  S ode r l und  M  C us t o m e r f a m i l i a r i t y a n d i t s e f f ect s o n satisfaction and behavioral intentions[J  P s y c h o lo g y  Marketing 2002 19\(10 861-879  S t a n go r  C a nd D u an C  E f f ec t s of M u l t i p l e T a s k Demands upon Memory for Information about Social Groups[J  J o ur n a l o f E x p e r i m e n t a l S o c i a l P s y ch ol og y  1991 27 pp.357378  T e as  R  K  1 993  E x pec t at i o ns  p e r f o r m ance evaluation and consumers  perceptions of quality Journal of Marketing 57\(October 18-34

mous, private requests, as used for large C library malloc calls, go to Big Memory and are tracked by our internal memory manager. On the other hand, ?le-backed mapping requests  used, for example, to support shared libraries  simply go to the regular Linux paged memory manager because Big Memory cannot be used for ?le mappings Figure 3. ZCB Process Address Space E. Page Fault Handler While we did not need to modify the TLB handler to implement Big Memory, we have added a hook to the Linux page fault handler \(see Figure 4 rst checks whether the current task is a ZCB. If it is, the code checks whether the faulting address is within the Big Memory area; if so, it installs the Big Memory TLB entries Essentially, we get a single TLB miss on the ?rst access after the process has been scheduled in; the entries normally remain in place until the process is scheduled out again. With context switches being fairly rare on the compute nodes, the entries are semi-static As shown in Figure 5, our Linux kernel partitions TLB entries in four groups: kernel mapping, paged memory, Big Memory, and device mappings. The last two groups are Figure 4. Big Memory Fault-Handling Flow speci?c to our implementation. Currently, the number of TLB entries required by Big Memory is proportional to the area size; for example, seven entries are needed to cover 1792MB. Three entries are used to cover the kernel memory kernel low memory, to be precise pin down some entries to cover BG/P-speci?c memorymapped I/O devices: the collective network, the torus DMA the lockbox, the Universal Performance Counter, and the Blue Gene Interrupt Controller. The Blue Gene Common Node Services code segment is also pinned Figure 5. TLB Partitioning in the Zepto Kernel F. Other Kernel Modi?cations Introducing a new concept invariably causes issues; the Big Memory implementation is no exception. Big Memory breaks a number of assumptions in Linux memory management. A ZCB process is forked from regular Linux processes; however, it cannot call fork itself, since the fork code apparently depends on the copy-on-write technique The lack of fork may be acceptable when we focus on a 69 high-performance compute node environment; besides, this is still better than the CNK, which does not support fork at all and must be rebooted to start another process Another issue is that the Big Memory mapping is strictly private and cannot be addressed from other processes  context. The Linux kernel function access_process_vm did not work for ZCB processes; this was an important issue because that function is used by the ptrace system call, on which debugging tools like strace and gdb depend Luckily, the problem was relatively easy to ?x; basically, we now temporarily install the Big Memory mapping while the function is running, to allow other processes to access the address space of the ZCB process V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION To evaluate single-node performance, we ran our memory microbenchmarks and an FFTW benchmark. For parallel performance evaluation, we used the NAS Parallel Benchmarks \(NPB  BG/P compute nodes with four different kernels: IBM CNK standard Linux with 4KB pages, Linux with 64KB pages and our enhanced Linux with Big Memory support. We used the GNU compiler toolchain that supports PowerPC 450 instructions to compile the benchmarks. Program binaries are compatible between the kernels, with the exception of NPB. For NPB, we could run only on CNK and Linux with Big Memory because we do not have MPI support for paged memory. Slight differences between CNK and Linux also exist in BG/P communication libraries, but the program 


also exist in BG/P communication libraries, but the program object ?les are the same A. Memory Benchmarks We evaluated the memory performance using two benchmarks: a streaming copy benchmark and the random memory access benchmark from Section III The streaming copy benchmark is simple: it allocates a memory buffer, divides it in two, and copies data from one region to the other using PowerPC 450 parallel load/store instructions. The benchmark reports the theoretical peak memory performance if it is run in a noise-free environment The results for several different buffer sizes can be found in Table III. With a 16KB buffer size, which ?ts well in the L1 cache, all kernels perform equally well, because no TLB misses are caused by the benchmark even under standard Linux with 4KB pages. With larger buffers, such as 4MB \(which ?t in the L3 cache which do not ?t Linux kernel is signi?cantly lower than under CNK. Linux with Big Memory shows a 0.2% loss compared to CNK This is a small performance hit, but it is still larger than expected, given that the noise level has been measured at just 0.03% \(see Section III detailed investigation of this phenomenon, but we suspect that instruction cache thrashing at context switch time caused by the OS tick update might be responsible; the benchmark issues a series of parallel load/store instructions, and the cost of cache thrashing might be higher than for an FPU benchmark Table III STREAMING COPY BENCHMARK \(GB/S 16KB 4MB 256MB CNK 6.74 4.60 3.85 Linux 4KB 6.73 3.85 3.35 Linux 64KB 6.74 4.51 3.82 Linux Big Memory 6.74 4.59 3.84 In Section III, we showed the results of the random memory access benchmark on CNK and on Linux with paged memory; there was a large difference in performance Table IV adds the result for Linux with Big Memory support the gap to CNK is narrowed to 0.04%, or within the system noise level Table IV RANDOM MEMORY ACCESS BENCHMARK MB/s CNK 44.70 Linux 4KB 14.39 Linux 64KB 16.40 Linux Big Memory 44.68 B.

Clearly, standard Linux does not perform well; 64KB pages improve performance by only 9%. On the other hand Linux with Big Memory shows just a 0.08% performance loss compared to the CNK Table V FFT BENCHMARK Elapsed Time \(s CNK 11.25 Linux 4KB 21.43 Linux 64KB 19.61 Linux Big Memory 11.24 C. NAS Parallel Benchmarks So far we have shown that the Big Memory implementation de?nitely improves memory performance of applications on a single node. To evaluate parallel performance we ran the NAS Parallel benchmarks [14] version 3.3 on 


we ran the NAS Parallel benchmarks [14] version 3.3 on both CNK and Linux with Big Memory support. We ran the experiment on 1024 nodes, in SMP mode \(one process per 70 node in Table VI. The performance is close: Linux runs were slower on most benchmarks compared to those using CNK by approx. 0.1% to 0.7%, with the exception of the IS benchmark, where Linux was 0.5% faster Although the table contains only the results using 1024 nodes, we have submitted most NAS Parallel benchmarks with 256, 512, and 1024 nodes to investigate scalability.

LOFAR Online Central Processing We had the opportunity to observe the performance of Big Memory in a real-life application. LOFAR is a radio telescope being built in the Netherlands [15]. In contrast to current radio telescopes that employ custom-built hardware as a correlator, LOFAR uses a Blue Gene/P supercomputer Our previous work discusses the LOFAR central processor in more detail [7], [16 LOFAR stations stream UDP/IP data directly into the Blue Gene/P I/O nodes at a rate of slightly more than 3Gbps These I/O nodes store the data in a main memory ring buffer which is used to absorb network delays or temporary hiccups in the processing pipeline. From here the data is transported to the compute nodes, where the information is correlated Poor main memory performance of the I/O node running the default Linux kernel proved to be one of the major bottlenecks in trying to achieve optimum data throughput Table VII shows a breakdown of the tasks on the Blue Gene/P I/O nodes running the LOFAR online processing application in a fairly standard 16-bit observation mode and a more challenging 4-bit mode. The required CPU resources in processor cores, are shown for the stock IBM I/O node kernel in the 16-bit mode and for a ZeptoOS compute node kernel, modi?ed to run on the I/O nodes, for both the 16bit and 4-bit modes. We see that using the original I/O node kernel would require almost two entire I/O node cores just to handle the ring buffer, and that there are not enough compute resources available to perform all the tasks in real time, even for the less demanding 16-bit mode We used a slightly modi?ed ZeptoOS compute node kernel, including support for the Ethernet device and excluding compute node speci?c devices like the torus network, on the I/O node. We reserved 1536MB of main memory as the Big Memory area and used it for the ring buffer using six 256MB TLB entries. The I/O node application was also adapted to copy 128 UDP/IP packets into the ring buffer at once, instead of one at a time. These two optimizations reduce the resources required to copy data into the ring buffer by more than 600%, about half of which can be attributed to the lack of TLB misses in the Big Memory area The more challenging 4-bit mode signi?cantly increases the potential number of TLB misses. Although limitations in the default kernel make direct comparison impossible smallscale memory benchmarks show a more than 500 reduction in required CPU cycles using Big Memory when 


reduction in required CPU cycles using Big Memory when copying UDP/IP packets one by one Clearly, the access pattern of the LOFAR I/O node application is very susceptible to performance hits caused by TLB misses. With the stock I/O node kernel, the processor was unable to achieve our throughput requirements. Preventing TLB misses for at least part of the application, combined with several other optimizations not discussed here, allowed us to reduce CPU load considerably, increasing I/O node performance to well beyond our original requirements Table VII LOFAR I/O NODE PROCESSING \(#CORES Stock ZeptoOS 16 bit 16 bit 4 bit Receive UDP/IP packets 1.44 1.44 1.22 Copy data to ring buffer 1.80 0.27 0.37 Send ring buffer to CN 1.40 0.52 0.61 Receive data from CN 1.00 0.10 0.35 Send results to storage 0.40 0.32 0.64 Total system load 151% 66.5% 79.7 VI. CONCLUSIONS This paper presented the implementation of Big Memory support for BG/P Linux  a transparent, ?at memory space for computational processes. Big Memory addresses two major issues encountered when attempting to run highperformance code on the BG/P Linux: poor memory performance caused by TLB misses handled in software, and the dif?culties of writing an ef?cient communication stack caused by the limitations of the BG/P torus  DMA engine Our experiments have shown that benchmarks running under a standard Linux kernel with paged memory can run up to three times slower than under CNK. With Big Memory support, Linux is slower by only 0.03  0.2%. We think that the 0.03% loss is due to the time spent executing the OS tick interrupt handler; with some benchmarks this can grow to 0.2%, presumably because of instruction cache thrashing With further kernel tuning, it should be possible to reduce the noise level to close to zero. Experiments at scale showed a slowdown of well under 1 71 Employing Big Memory on the I/O nodes was instrumental in reducing the I/O node CPU resources required for LOFAR online central processing. A 500  600% performance increase was observed in key parts of the application allowing the I/O nodes to achieve their required throughput Our modi?cations to the Linux kernel are relatively small principally because we focused exclusively on the requirements of computational processes, rather than trying to solve the problem in a generally applicable way, which would have been far more complicated. We maintain two versions of Linux kernel, and we found porting the Big Memory patches between the kernels to be straightforward Contemporary parallel architectures such as Blue Gene/P Cray XT5, and Roadrunner use commodity CPUs such as Intel Xeon, AMD Opteron, or IBM PowerPC, instead of designs dedicated to computational environments. The memory management units in these processors are essentially designed to support a highly multitasking environment. It would be interesting if future designs had hardware support for computational process address space similar to the Big Memory area that we implemented, to allow for a seamless coexistence of high-performance applications and standard Unix processes on the compute nodes Along with the Big Memory implementation, we conceived the idea of a special process that the kernel treats differently from other processes. In the case of Big Memory the kernel creates a different application address space, and we showed that this idea works for compute nodes. We have also experimented with other uses of this feature, such as disabling nonessential interrupts when a computational process gets scheduled in order to reduce the system noise Our current implementation is suitable for benchmarking 


Our current implementation is suitable for benchmarking and simple applications. We need to make several improvements in the quality of implementation, such as the granularity of the Big Memory area. So far, we have had little experience with running large, real-world applications on the compute nodes using our modi?ed kernel; this area will be explored as part of our future research Acknowledgments: We thank IBM  s Todd Inglett Thomas Musta, Thomas Gooding, George Alma  si, Sameer Kumar, Michael Blocksome, and Robert Wisniewski for their advice on programming the Blue Gene hardware.

interact with strategic and structural properties of a firm Also, as we see growing amounts of regulation and stronger public reactions to how firms conduct their business, compliance issues have received increased attention. Especially from an IT governance perspective, two questions are exciting to ask: How are alignment and compliance related, i.e. to what extent can or should the dimensions of alignment be an explicit part of compliance activities? And one step further: As regulation regarding internal controls like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the USA affects almost all IT activities [61] this is a highly relevant issue. From an IT business value perspective, IT business alignment may be a driver but IT compliance may act as a constraint In practice, combining the demands for compliance and value delivery of IT is widely seen as the domain of IT governance [43]. This leads to the second question: Is there a positive business value impact from compliance beside just being compliant, i.e. do improvements from better governance/alignment structures and actions would have been worth the effort even without external regulatory pressure Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 References   1] Alavi, M. and Leidner, D.E., "Review: Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual Foundations and Research Issues", MIS Quarterly 25\(1 2] Armstrong, J.S. and Overton, T.S., "Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys", Journal of Marketing Research, 14 3] Avison, D., Jones, J., Powell, P., and Wilson, D., "Using and Validating the Strategic Alignment Model", Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13\(3 4] Barua, A., Kriebel, C.H., and Mukhopadhyay, T., "Information Technologies and Business Value: An Analytical and Empirical Investigation", Information Systems Research, 6\(1 5] Bassellier, G. and Benbasat, I., "Business Competence of Information Technology Professionals: Conceptual Development and Influence on IT-Business Partnerships MIS Quarterly, 28\(4 6] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Gomber, P., Wagner, H.-T and Weitzel, T., "Die Bedeutung des Alignments von IT und Fachressourcen in Finanzprozessen: Eine empirische Untersuchung", Wirtschaftsinformatik, 48\(5 339 7] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of outsourcing on IT business alignment and IT flexibility: a survey in the German banking industry",  Twelfth Americas Conference on Information Systems AMCIS 8] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "Strategy matters - The role of strategy type for IT business value",  12th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS 9] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of operational alignment on IT flexibility Empirical evidence from a survey in the German banking industry",  13th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS CO 10] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The Influence of Alignment on the PostImplementation Success of a Core Banking Information System: An Embedded Case Study",  40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences \(HICSS Big Island \(HI

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
