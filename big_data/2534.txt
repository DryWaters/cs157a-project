One domain-wall nanowire based logic-in-memory\narchitecture is proposed for big-data processing, where the\ndomain-wall nanowire memory is deployed as main memory\nfor data storage as well as XOR-logic for comparison and\naddition operations. The domain-wall nanowire based logic-\nin-memory circuits are evaluated by SPICE-level verifications.\nFurther evaluated by applications of general-purpose SPEC2006\nbenchmark and also web-searching oriented Phoenix benchmark,\nthe proposed computing platform can exhibit a significant power\nsaving on both main memory and ALU under the similar\nperformance when compared to CMOS based designs.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe analysis of big-data at exascale \(1018 bytes or flops intro-\nduced the emerging need to reexamine the existing hardware platform\nthat can support memory-oriented computing. A big-data-driven\napplication requires huge bandwidth with maintained low-power den-\nsity. For example, web-searching application involves crawling, com-\nparing, ranking, and paging of billions of web-pages with extensive\nmemory access [1]. However, the current data-processing platform\nhas well-known memory-wall with limited accessing bandwidth but\nalso large leakage power at advanced CMOS technology nodes As\nsuch, a power-efficient memory-based design is highly desirable for\nfuture big-data processing. Towards this end, there are many recent\nexplorations by the newly discovered non-volatile memory \(NVM such as phase-change memory \(PCM STT-RAM ReRAM 2],\n[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].\nThe primary advantage of NVM is the potential as the universal\nmemory with significantly reduced leakage power. For example, STT-\nRAM is considered as the second-generation of spin-based memory,\nwhich has sub-nanosecond magnetization switching time and sub-pJ\nswitching energy [9 10], [11]. As the third-generation of spin-based\nmemory, domain-wall nanowire, also known as racetrack memory\n[12], [13], is a newly introduced NVM device that can have multiple\nbits densely packed in one single nanowire, where each bit can be\naccessed by the manipulation of the domain-wall. Compared with\nSTT-RAM, the domain-wall nanowire is able to provide the similar\nspeed and power but with much higher density or throughput 14].\nSince domain-wall nanowire has close-to-DRAM density but with\nclose-to-zero standby power, it becomes an ideal candidate for future\nmain memory that can be utilized for big-data processing.\nHowever, there is no in-depth study to explore domain-wall\nnanowire based computing platform towards big-data processing For\nexample, no link has been made to perform big-data logic operation\nbased on spin-based device such as domain-wall nanowire. What is\nmore, no domain-wall nanowire device model has been developed in\nterms of accuracy and efficiency for circuit designs. In this paper,\nwe show that shift-operation in domain-wall nanowire can introduce\nunique capability to perform logic operations which other NVM\ndevices do not have. Due to the low operating power and also\nzero standby power, the logic operations such as XOR-logic for\ncomparison and addition by domain-wall nanowire can be performed\nin an ultra-low power fashion towards big-data applications such as\nweb-searching. As such, one can design a memory-based computing\nplatform with both memory and logic by domain-wall nanowire de-\nvices. In addition, a SPICE behavior model of domain-wall nanowire\nhas been developed for circuit-level verification of both memory\nand logic designs, which further provide system-level evaluation of\narea, timing and power. The numerical experiments show that, with\nthe use of applications of general-purpose SPEC2006 benchmark\nand also web-searching oriented Phoenix benchmark, the proposed\nmemory-based computing platform by domain-wall nanowire can\nreduce 92% leakage power and 16% dynamic power when compared\nwith main memory implemented by DRAM; and can reduce 31%\nboth dynamic and 65% leakage power under the similar performance\nwhen compared with ALU implemented by their CMOS counterpart.\nThe rest of this paper is organized in the following manner. Section\nII introduces the overall memory-based computing platform based\non domain-wall nanowire. Section III discusses the SPICE model\nof domain-wall nanowire. Section IV describes the main memory\ndesign by domain-wall nanowire. Section V presents the XOR-logic\nfor comparison and addition by domain-wall nanowire. Experimental\nresults are presented in Section VI with conclusion in Section VII.\nII.

A memory-based computing system is organized with in-\ntegrated many-core microprocessor and main memory, which are\nmainly composed of the non-volatile domain-wall nanowire devices.\nThe many-core microprocessors are further classified into 


clusters.\nEach cluster shares L2-cache and accesses the main memory by\n    An Ultralow-power Memory-based Big-data Computing Platform \nby Nonvolatile Domain-wall Nanowire Devices\n978-1-4799-1235-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE                            329                   Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design  \nshared memory bus. Each core works highly independently for\nallocated tasks such as Map or Reduce functions.\nIn this paper, the domain-wall nanowire is intensively utilized\ntowards the ultra-low power big-data processing in both memory\nand logic, simultaneously. The domain-wall nanowire based main\nmemory can significantly reduce both the leakage and operating\npower of the main memory. What is more, large-volume of memory\ncan be integrated with high density for data-driven applications. As\nsuch, one can build a hybrid memory system with CMOS-based cache\nas well as domain-wall nanowire based main memory, which com-\nposition can be optimized by studying the accessing patterns under\nbig-data applications. More importantly, the domain-wall nanowire is\nalso explored for computing purpose in this paper. Specifically, the\ndomain-wall nanowire based XOR-logic for comparison and addition\nis studied in details based on the following observations. Firstly, at\ninstruction level, the web-searching orientated big-data applications\nusually involve intensive string operations, namely comparison, where\nthe XOR and Adder logics will be visited more frequently than usual.\nMoreover, from logic level, the transistors to implement XOR gates in\nALU account for more than half of the total number, due to its much\nhigher complexity compared to the NAND, NOR and NOT gates. As\nsuch, an optimized design of XOR-logic by new technology such as\ndomain-wall nanowire may provide the largest margin to optimize\nhardware for big-data processing.\nIII. DEVICE MODELING AND SIMULATION\nDomain-wall nanowire, also known as racetrack memory 12], is\na newly introduced non-volatile memory device in which multiple\nbits of information are stored in single ferromagnetic nanowire. As\nshown in Figure 2\(a rightward\nmagnetization direction, and adjacent bits are separated by domain\nwalls. By applying a current through the shift port at the two ends of\nthe nanowire, all the domain walls will move left or right at the same\nvelocity while the domain width of each bit remains unchanged, thus\nthe stored information is preserved Such a tape-like operation will\nshift all the bits similarly like a shift register.\nIn order to access the information stored in the domains, a strongly\nmagnetized ferromagnetic layer is placed at desired position of the\nferromagnetic nanowire and is separated by an insulator layer. Such\na sandwich-like structure forms a magnetic-tunnel-junction \(MTJ write, read and shift operations are modeled respectively.\nEasy\nAxis\nHa\nrd\nAx\nis\nOut-of-plane\ndirection\n?\n?\nX\nZ\nY\nR\n1k\n2k\nV0 0.6-0.6\nMagnetic\ntunnel\njunction\nInsulator\nFixed layer\nWrite/read\nport\nShift\nport\nContact\nDomain\nwall\nFig. 2 a b free-layer in spherical coordinates with defined\nmagnetization angles; and \(c Magnetization reversal\nThe write access can be modeled as the magnetization reversal\nof MTJ free layer, i.e the target domain of the nanowire.

As such, the general MTJ resistance\ncan be calculated by the giant magnetoresistance \(GMR u, ?b 1? cos\(?u ? ?b 3 magnetization angles of upper free layer and\nbottom fixed layer, Rl0 and Rh0 are the MTJ resistances when the\napplied voltage is subtle.

Domain-wall propagation\nLike a shift register, the domain-wall nanowire shifts in a digital\nmanner, thus could be digitalized and modeled in the unit of domains,\nin which a bit is stored. Note that except the bit in the MTJ the\nother bits denoted by the magnetization directions are only affected\nby their adjacent bits. In other words, the magnetization of each bit\nis controlled by the magnetization in adjacent domains. Inspired by\nthis we present a magnetization controlled magnetization \(MCM nanowires. Unlike\nthe current-controlled and voltage-controlled devices, the control in\nMCM device needs to be 


triggered by rising edge of one SHF-signal,\nwhich can be formulated as\n? =f\(Tsl, ?r, Tsr, ?l, ?c Tsr?l + T slT sr?0.\n\(5 magnetization angles in right adjacent cell and left\nadjacent cell respectively; ?c is the current state before the trigger\nsignal. This describes that the ?-state will change when triggered and\nwill remain state if no shift-signal is issued.\nFor the bit in MTJ, the applied voltage for spin-based read\nand write will also determine the ?-state as discussed previously.\nTherefore we have,\n? = f\(Tsl, ?r, Tsr, ?l, ?0 V p, V n c 6 V p, V n, ?0 additional term that combines Equation 1\nto 4.\nIn addition, the domain-wall propagation velocity can be mimicked\nby the SHF-request frequency. The link between the SHF-request\nfrequency and the propagation velocity is the experimentally observed\nby current-velocity relation [16],\nv = k\(J ?

As such, the modified nodal analysis \(MNA  18] to verify circuit designs\nby domain-wall nanowire devices.\nIV. DOMAIN-WALL NANOWIRE BASED MAIN MEMORY\nCompared with the conventional SRAM or DRAM by CMOS,\nthe domain-wall nanowire based memory \(DWM demonstrate\ntwo major advantages. Firstly, extremely high integration density can\nbe achieved since multiple bits can be packed in one macro-cell.\nSecondly, zero standby power can be expected as a non-volatile\ndevice does not require to be powered to retain the stored data.\nIn addition, the resistance-detection based readout does not require\nbit-line pre-charging, which avoids the sub-threshold leakage of the\naccess transistors. In this section, we will present DWM-based design\nwith macro-cell memory: structure, modeling, and data organization.\nA.

The left-half segment of nanowire is used for data\nstorage while the right-half segment is reserved for shift-operation in\norder to avoid information lost. In order to access the left-most bit, the\nreserved segment has to be at least as long as data segment. In such\ncase, the data utilization rate is only 50%. In order to improve the\ndata utilization rate, a multiple port macro-cell structure is presented\nin Figure 3\(b are equally distributed along the\nnanowire, which divides the nanowire into multiple segments. Except\nthe right-most segment, all other segments are data segments with the\nbits in one segment form a group. In such case, to access arbitrary\nbit in the nanowire, the shift-offset is always less than the length of\none segment thus the data utilization rate is greatly improved.\nThus, the number of bits in one macro-cell can be calculated by\nNcell?bits = \(Nrw?ports + 1 8 Then the macro-\ncell area can be calculated by\nAnanowire = Ncell?bitsLbitWnanowire \(9 2Ashf?nmos\n+ 2Arw?nmosNrw?ports\n\(10 width of domain-wall nanowire, Ashf?nmos and Arw?nmos are\nthe transistor size at shift-port and access-port respectively.\nMoreover, the bit-line capacitance is crucial in the calculation of\nlatency and dynamic power The increased bit-line capacitance due\nto the multiple access-ports can be obtained by\nCbit?line Nrw?portsCdrain?rw\n+Cdrain?shf + Cbl?metal 11 metal wire per cell,\nthe Cdrain?rw and Cdrain?shf are the access-port and shift-port\ntransistor drain capacitances, respectively. Note that the undesired\nincrease of per-cell capacitance will be suppressed by the reduced\nnumber of rows due to higher nanowire utilization rate.\nAdditionally, the domain-wall nanowire specific behaviors will\nincur in-cell delay and energy dissipation. The magnetization reversal\nenergy 0.27pJ and delay 600ps can be obtained through the transient\nanalysis by the SPICE-like simulation as discussed in Section III. The\nread-energy is in fJ scale thus can be omitted. Also, the read-operation\nwill not contribute in-cell delay. The delay of shift-operation can be\ncalculated by\nTshift = Lbit/vprop \(12 the domain-wall propagation velocity that can be\ncalculated by Equation 7. The Joule heat caused by the injected\ncurrent is calculated as the shift-operation dynamic energy.\nB. Cluster-group data organization\nHowever, there are two potential problems for such DWM macro-\ncell. Firstly, there exists variable access latencies for the bits that\nlocate at different positions in the nanowire. Secondly, if the required\nbits are all stored in the same nanowire, very long access latency will\nbe incurred due to the sequential access.\nIt is important to note that the data exchange between main\nmemory and cache is always in 


the unit of a cache-line size of\ndata, i.e. the main memory will be read-accessed when last-level\ncache miss occurs; and will be write-accessed when a cache-line\nneeds to be evicted. Therefore, instead of the per access latency, the\nlatency of the data block in the size of a cache-line becomes the\nmain concern. Based on such fact, we present a cluster-group based\ndata organization. The idea behind cluster is to distribute data in\ndifferent nanowires thus they can be accessed in parallel to avoid the\nsequential access; and the idea behind group is to discard the within-\ngroup addressing, and transfer the Ngroup?bits bits in Ngroup?bits\nconsecutive cycles, to avoid the variable latency. Specifically, a cluster\nis the bundle of domain-wall nanowires that can be selected together\nthrough bit-line multiplexers. The number of nanowires in one cluster\nequals the I/O bus bandwidth of the memory. Note that the data in\none cache-line have consecutive addresses. Thus, by distributing the\nbits of N consecutive bytes, where N is decided by the I/O bus\nbandwidth into different nanowire within a cluster, the required N\nbytes can be accessed in parallel to avoid the sequential access. In\naddition, within each nanowire in the cluster, the data will be accessed\nin the unit of group, i.e. the bits in each group will be accessed in\nconsecutive cycles with a similar fashion as DRAM.\nThe number of groups per nanowire is thus decided by\nNgroup?bits = Nline?bits/Nbus?bits. \(13 system with cache-line size of 64-byte, and memory\nI/O bus bandwidth of 64-bit, the group size is 8-bit. As such, the\nDWM with cluster-group based data organization can be operated in\nthe following steps:\n• Step1: The group-head initially is aligned with the access-\nport, thus the distributed first 8 consecutive bytes can be first\ntransferred between memory and cache;\n• Step2: Shift the nanowire with 1-bit offset, and transfer the\nfollowing 8 consecutive bytes. Iterate this step 6 more times\nuntil the whole cache-line data is transferred;\n• Step3: After the data transfer is completed, the group-head is\nrelocated to the initial position as required in step 1.\nAs mentioned in Section III-C, the current-controlled domain-wall\npropagation velocity is proportional to the applied shift-current,. By\napplying a larger shift-current, a fast one-cycle cluster head relocation\ncan be achieved. In such a manner, the data-transfer of cache block\nwill be able to achieve a fixed and also lowest possible latency.\nV. DOMAIN-WALL NANOWIRE BASED LOGIC\nThe magnetization switching with sub-nanosecond speed and and\nsub-pJ energy have been experimentally demonstrated [9], [10 11].\nAs such, the domain-wall nanowire based logic \(DWL computing. In this section, we\nshow how to further build DWL based XOR-logic, and how it is\napplied for low-power ALU design for comparison and addition\noperations.\nA. DWL-based XOR-logic Circuit\nThe GMR-effect can be interpreted as the bitwise-XOR operation\nof the magnetization directions of two thin magnetic layers where\nthe output is denoted by high or low resistance. In a GMR-based\nMTJ structure, however, the XOR-logic will fail as there is only one\noperand as variable since the magnetization in fixed layer is constant.\nNevertheless, this problem can be overcome by the unique domain-\nwall shift-operation in the domain-wall nanowire device, which\nenables the possibility of DWL-based XOR-logic for computing.\nSHF1SHF1\nRD\nRDWR1\nWR1 SHF2SHF2\nWR2\nWR2\nLoad A Load BOutput\nFig. 4: Low power XOR-logic implemented by two domain wall nanowires\nA bitwise-XOR logic implemented by two domain-wall nanowires\nis shown in Figure 4. The proposed bitwise-XOR logic is performed\nby constructing a new read-only-port, where two free layers and one\ninsulator layer are stacked. The two free layers are in the size of\none magnetization domain and are from two respective nanowires.\nThus, the two operands, denoted as the magnetization direction in\nfree layer, can both be variables with values assigned through the\nMTJ of the according nanowire. As such, it can be shifted to the\noperating port such that the XOR-logic is performed.\nFor example, the A?B can be executed in the following steps\n• The operands A and B are loaded into two nanowires by\nenabling WL1 and WL2 respectively;\n• A and B are shifted from their access-ports to the read-only-\nports by enabling SHF1 and SHF2 respectively;\n• By enabling RD, the bitwise-XOR result can be obtained\nthrough the GMR-effect.\nNote that in the x86 architecture processors, most XOR instruc-\ntions also need a few cycles to load its operands before the logic is\nperformed unless the two operands are both in registers. As such, the\nproposed DWL-based XOR-logic can be a potential substitution of\nthe CMOS-based XOR-logic. Moreover, similar as the DWM macro-\ncell, zero leakage can be achieved for such XOR-logic.\nB. DWL-XOR based ALU\nThe DWL-XOR can be applied into ALU design in two function\nunits, the N-input XOR and N-input full-adder for comparison and\naddition operations, respectively As discussed in Section II, such\ntwo units account for more than half of the total transistors in ALU,\nand also are the most frequently visited units, especially in big data\napplications. The N-input XOR-logic can be realized in by employing\nN -bitwise DWL-XOR, which is able to take the highly intensive\ncomparison instruction.\nIn the following, we present a full-adder design by DWL-XOR as\nshown in Figure 5. As each CMOS-based XOR-logic is built with\nA\nB\nCin\nCout\nSDW DW\nXOR1\nXOR2\nctrl1 ctrl2\nNon-volatile\nvolatile\nFig. 5 Full adder design with DWL based XOR logic\nfour 2-input NAND gates, the substitution by DWL-based 


XOR-logic\nthereby can reduce roughly three quarters of the leakage power. Note\nthat the addition of DWL-based full adder is also carried out in\nmultiple cycles. Take A + B + Cin as an example, the full-adder\nexecutes in the following steps.\n• The operands A and B are loaded to the domain-wall nanowires\nin XOR1;\n• The two operands are shifted to the read-only-port and the\ninternal A?B result is generated;\n• The CMOS-logic generates the Cout immediately;\n• The internal A?B result and Cin are loaded into XOR2;\n• The two operands are shifted to the read-only-port and the sum\nS = A?B ? Cin can be obtained.\nAs such, by connecting N full-adders together, an N-bit full-adder\ncan be achieved and integrated into the ALU. Note that there\nare two more control-signals crtl1 and crtl2 used for nanowire\noperation control. A full-adder is able to execute both ADD and\nSUB instruction, thus together with the N-input DWL-XOR, a very\nlarge portion of the instructions can be optimized in terms of power\nreduction. In addition, the stalls caused by the slightly longer cycles\ncan be greatly suppressed in the out-of-order superscalar processor.\nVI. EXPERIMENT AND DISCUSSION\nA. Experiment settings and methodology\nWe have the following evaluation of the proposed domain-wall\nnanowire based big-data computing platform with both memory and\nlogic, respectively. The system configuration is shown in Table I.\nThe 32-bit 65nm processor is assumed with four cores integrated. In\neach core, there are 6 integer ALUs which executes XOR, OR, AND,\nNOT, ADD and SUB operations, and complex integer operations like\nMUL, DIV are executed in integer MUL. The 32nm technology node\nand 64-bit I/O bus width are assumed for memory.\nFirstly, gem5 [19 simulator is employed to take both SPEC2000\nand Phoenix benchmarks [20] and to generate the runtime instruction\nand memory accessing traces. The trace file is then analyzed with\nthe statistics of instructions that can be executed on the proposed\nXOR and adder for logic evaluation. The L2-cache-miss rates are also\ngenerated, in order to obtain the actual memory access for memory\nevaluation.\nNext, the McPAT[21] is extended with additional power models\nof DWL-based XOR-logic as described in Section V. As such,\nboth accurate dynamic power and leakage power information of\nDWL-based ALU can be acquired. Meanwhile, as described in\nSection IV, the domain-wall nanowire based memory differs from the\nconventional CMOS-based memory in many aspects, thus CACTI[22]\nhas been extended with the domain-wall nanowire based memory\nmodel for DWM based main memory, with accurate device operation\nenergy and delay data obtained from SPICE simulator developed in\nSection III.\nTABLE I: System configuration\nProcessor\nTechnology node 65nm\nNumber of cores 4\nFrequency 1GHz\nArchitecture x86, O3, issue width - 4, 32 bits\nFunctional units\nInteger ALU - 6\nComplex ALU - 1\nFloating point unit - 2\nCache\nL1: 32KB - 8 way/32KB - 8 way\nL2: 1MB - 8 way\nLine size - 64 bytes\nMemory\nTechnology node 32nm\nMemory size 2GB - 128MB per bank\nIO bus width 64 bits\nB.

The operating-port is implemented as\na developed magnetization controlled magnetization \(MCM the cycles of loadA and loadB, the precession switching\ncan be observed for the MTJs of both nanowires. Also the switching\nenergy and time have been calculated as 0.27pJ and 600ps, which\nis consistent with the reported devices [9], [10], [11]. In the shift\ncycles, triggered by the SHF -control signal, the dynamics ? and\n? of both upper and bottom layers are updated immediately. In the\noperation cycle, a subtle sensing current is applied to provoke GMR-\neffect. Subtle magnetization disturbance is also observed in both\nlayers in the MCM device, which validates the read-operation.

configuration.\nIt can be observed that the memory area is greatly reduced in\nthe DWM designs. Specifically the DWMs with 1/2/4/8 access ports\ncan achieve the area saving of 57%,70%,70% and 72%, respectively.\nThe trend also indicates that the increase of number of access-\nports will lead to higher area saving. This is because of the higher\nnanowire utilization rate, and is consistent with the analysis discussed\nin Section IV. Note that the area saving in turn results in a smaller\naccess latency, and hence the DWM designs on average provide\n1.9X improvement on the access latency. However, the DWM needs\none more cycle to perform shift operation, which will cancel out\nthe latency advantage. Overall, the DWM and DRAM have similar\nspeed performance. In terms of power, the DWM designs also exhibit\nbenefit with significantly leakage power reduction. The designs with\n1/2/4/8 access ports can achieve 92%,95%,96% and 97% leakage\npower reduction rates, respectively. The advantage mainly comes\nfrom the non-volatility of domain-wall nanowire based memory cells.\nThe reduction in area and decoding peripheral circuits can further\nhelp leakage power reduction in DWM designs. In addition, the DWM\ndesigns have the following trend of access energy when increasing\nthe number of access ports. The designs with 1/2 ports require 16%\nand 6% less energy, while designs with 4/8 ports incur 15% and 70%\nhigher access energy cost. This is because when the number of ports\nincreases, there are more transistors connected to the bit-line which\nleads to increased bit-line capacitance.\n4\n6\n8\n10\na\nli\nze\nd\nm\ne\nm\no\nry\nre\nfe\nre\nn\nce\nSPEC2006 Phoenix\n0\n2\nN\no\nrm\n50\nW\n DWM\n20\n30\n40\nc\nP\no\nw\ne\nr\n\(u\nW\n0\n10\nD\ny\nn\na\nm\nic\n2761 2330\n\(a b a both DRAM and DWM under\nPhoenix and SPEC2006 \(b power comparison under different bench-\nmark programs are shown in Figure 7\(a the\ndynamic power is very sensitive to the input benchmark, and the re-\nsults of the Phoenix benchmarks shows no significant difference from\nthose in SPEC2006.

However, both L1 and\nL2 cache miss rates of Phoenix benchmarks are much lower than\nSPEC2006 which is due to the very predictable memory access\npattern when exhaustively handling data in Phoenix benchmarks.\nOverall, the low cache miss rates of Phoenix benchmarks cancel\nout the higher memory reference demands, which leads to a modest\ndynamic power. Also, the runtime dynamic power contributes much\nless to the total power consumption compared to leakage power,\nthus the leakage reduction should be the main design objective when\ndetermining the number of access ports.\nD. Power evaluation of ALU logic\nFrom DWL-XOR based ALU design evaluation, McPAT is mod-\nified to evaluate power of the 32-bit ALU that is able to perform\nXOR, OR AND, NOT, ADD and SUB operations. The instruction\ncontrolling decoder circuit is also considered during the power\nevaluation. The leakage power of both designs is calculated at gate\nlevel by the McPAT power model.\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nw\ne\nr\(W\n DWLALUdynamic\n0\n0.1\n0.2\np\no\nFig. 8: The per core ALU power comparison between CMOS design and\nDWL based design\nFigure 8 presents the per-core ALU power comparison between the\nconventional CMOS design and domain-wall nanowire logic \(DWL leakage power can be greatly reduced. It can be observed\nthat the set of Phoenix benchmarks consume higher dynamic power\ncompared to those of SPEC2006, which is due to the high parallelism\nof MapReduce framework with high utilization rate of the ALUs.\nAmong each set, the power results exhibit a low sensitivity to the\ninput which indicates that percentages of instructions executed in\nXOR and ADDER of ALU are relatively stable even for different\nbenchmarks. The stable improvement ensures the extension of the\nproposed DWL to other applications. Averagely, a dynamic power\nreduction of 31% and leakage power reduction of 65% can be\nachieved for ALU logic based on all the eight benchmarks.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThe domain-wall nanowire based memory-computing is explored\nin this paper towards big-data applications such as web-searching.\nThe shift-operation in domain-wall nanowire has been adapted to\nperform logic operations such as XOR-logic for comparison as well\nas addition. Therefore, one can build a highly logic-in-memory com-\nputing platform with both memory and logic implemented by domain-\nwall nanowire devices. The SPICE behavior model of domain-wall\nnanowire is also developed for both circuit-level verification and\nsystem-level evaluation Utilizing applications of general-purpose\nSPEC2006 benchmark and also web-searching oriented Phoenix\nbenchmark, we find that the domain-wall nanowire based computing\ncan reduce 92% leakage power and 16 dynamic power when\ncompared with main memory implemented by DRAM; and can also\nreduce 31% both dynamic and 65 leakage power under the similar\nperformance when compared with ALU by implemented by their\nCMOS counterpart.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work is sponsored by Singapore MOE TIER-2 fund\nMOE2010-T2-2-037 \(ARC 5/11 and A*STAR SERC-PSF\nfund 11201202015.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
