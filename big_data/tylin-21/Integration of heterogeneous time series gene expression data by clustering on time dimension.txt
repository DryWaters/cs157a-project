performance optimizations were introduced  87  Optimizations such as were evaluated and adopted for production for some of the Netîix applications There exists a large body of work on garbage collection GC a comprehensive bibliography on garbage collection is available at  88  Recently  se v eral GC techniques addressing concurrency and scalability have been proposed  89   90   91  In a similar v ein a multitude of techniques have been proposed for automatic adaptive heap sizing  92   93  Existing dynamic optimizations employ code specialization/versioning to enable for example but not limited to runtime parallelization and runtime SIMDization The optimizations learn from program executions corresponding to different inputs However these optimizations are oblivious of systemic state For example as mentioned earlier in this section available CPU may vary in a multi-tenant environment Thus in the cloud context advanced dynamic optimizations need to developed which can learn from the systemic state For instance let us consider Figure 8 which shows variation in heap usage during a 12 hr window for a Netîix application From the gure we note that the heap usage varies signiìcantly This can in part be ascribed to variation in incoming trafìc over time there are few users streaming video at night Learning the allocation elasticity  94   a measure of ho w the number of GCs changes when the heap size changes  can potentially help guide setting up of autoscaling  95  policies on the cloud IV C ONCLUSION In  64  Satish et al sho wed that for throughput computing applications there is a large performance gap between existing software and best optimized code on modern multimany core processors In this paper we presented a program optimization perspective to the challenges posed by Big Data Speciìcally we discussed exploiting multi/many cores exploiting wide SIMD and the role of dynamic optimization in the context of Big Data and cloud-based architectures R EFERENCES  R E Bryant R H Katz and E D Lazo wska Big-Data Computing Creating revolutionary breakthroughs in commerce science and society Dec 2008 http://cra.org/ccc/docs/init/Big Data.pdf   Challenges and Opportunities with Big Data  http://cra.org/ccc/docs init/bigdatawhitepaper.pdf   Dro wning in numbers Digital data will ood the planetand help us understand it better 2011 http://www.economist.com/blogs dailychart/2011/11/big-data-0   Federal Go v ernment Big Data Rollout  2012 http://www.nsf.gov news/news videos.jsp?cntn id=123607&media id=72174&org=NSF   J Man yika M Chui B Bro wn J Bughin R Dobbs C Roxburgh and A H Byers Big data The next frontier for innovation competition and productivity May 2011 http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Research/Technology and Innovation/Big data The next frontier for innovation   S Lohr  The Age of Big Data  Feb  2012 http://www.nytimes com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html pagewanted=all   Big Data Mark et Size and V endor Re v enues  http://wikibon.org wiki/v/Big Data Market Size and Vendor Revenues   P  Dube y  A Platform 2015 Model Recognition Mining and Synthesis Moves Computers to the Era of Tera Feb 2005 ftp://download.intel.com/technology/computing/archinnov platform2015/download/RMS.pdf   B Liang Compute-intensi v e highly parallel applications and uses

is also displayed in Figure 5 Dominant color means the color with the highest value of the 11 basic colors The same is true of dominant emotion The user selects the feature that seems to be important from these charts in order to analyze it in detail In this example the user selects the feature blue Feature details The system then shows in the form of a graph details for the features selected by the user The graph shows the distribution of the selected features in terms of increase and decrease points It also shows a breakdown by dominant regenerated objects for the change points with the 200 highest values the bluest objects in this example Thumbnails of the points corresponding to each object are also shown These charts reveal that blue is the most signicant color because of the weather reports indicating that the viewers were highly interested in such reports In addition to these charts the system shows lists of points with thumbnails and related information sorted by the feature value see the list of changes points in Figure 5 The system also provides more detail for each point in the form of a ratings graph along with the program guide information Refiltering with interactive feedback We can interactively add or change lters to discover additional patterns In the example shown in Figure 5 the object corresponding to weather reports ID  85 can be ltered out by adding a lter for object features This lter lets us analyze popular new topics after removing the noise from the weather report In this way numerous patterns of audience behavior can be discovered by combining various types of ltering with interactive feedback Figures 6 and 7 show examples of questions that can be asked to obtain knowledge from TV ratings data using our framework The rst three questions Q1ñQ3 shown in Figure 6 represent an analysis for nding a particular pattern of a ratings increase for a specic categoryóhere the categories were news dramas and variety shows In addition to the program category lter we used the lters that extract transitions made during a CF to focus on peopleís interest in the program content For the news program Figure 6a we found that weather reports and sports news were popular For dramas Figure 6b scores for black and dominance computed from the brightness and saturation were the highest The example thumbnails indicate that scenes where the screen is heavily dark tend to be serious scenes during which viewers usually stay on that channel For variety shows Figure 6c we found that high entropy and amusement tend to increase TV ratings The example thumbnails indicate that lively scenes match the needs of people watching variety shows The difference in user behavior for variety shows versus dramas becomes clear when comparing the visualizations produced by our system In contrast to Q1ñQ3 for our fourth question Q4 focuses on the decrease points see Figure 7a Because the initial statistics suggest that thereís a correlation between the color brown and decrease points we selected brown and found that people tended to switch the channels during news commentary and live televised broadcasts of parliament ary proceedings On the basis of the results we ltered out objects corresponding to news commentary and parliamentary proceedings to analyze other factors After ltering black seemed the most signicant feature By selecting and further analyzing this color feature we found that live broadcasts in the dark are also correlated with a ratings decrease For Q5 we tested whether animals inuence ratings see Figure 7b We rst compared the distribution of the scores for an animal between the increase and decrease points for certain categories and found that a difference was observed especially for variety shows To discover more about how an animal can contribute to TV ratings we used an animal lter with a threshold score of 0.3 Analyzing decrease points revealed that animals do indeed seem to inuence ratings except for animals in water For Q6 we targeted a specic event the ooding of the Kinugawa River to learn how viewers behaved following that event We searched for the target event by combining the following lters month program category and keywords The increase and decrease points revealed that people tended to watch live broadcasts and turn to other channels when live event coverage ends News Event Detection and Analysis We developed an application to detect news stories of interest by analyzing the set of change points in news programs We use increase points observed in two categoriesónews and informational programsówhich reect viewers interest in news stories In addition to nding popular IEEE MultiMedia 50 


news topics our analysis revealed other valuable knowledge For example by comparing broadcasting times and ratings increases we could analyze whether the intention of TV stations matched the interests of viewers In addition analyzing audience behaviors when watching news about a disaster can help broadcasters and others determine how best to disseminate information regarding disaster preparedness to maximize who sees retains and acts on such information We detect news stories by analyzing keywords that co-occur with increase points We rst construct a graph from change points with each node corresponding to an increase point We can nd clusters that consist of multiple change points by mining the graph The clusters that contain the most increase points correspond to the news stories of most interest The details of the detection algorithms are described elsewhere 5 To evaluate whether our method could detect important news stories we used the top 10 news stories in Japan for 2015 as reported by the Yomiuri newspaper as the ground truth Table 3 shows the correspondence between the ground truth and our top 10 detected results The CP column shows the rank based on the number of change points in each detected news story This result shows our method detected ve of the 10 ground truth stories The Yomiuri rankings shows the big news stories in general while our rankings shows the news that viewers were most interested in because many people switch channels to a specic news story at the change point Our results revealed that viewers tended to switch the channel to negative news stories such as those about a murder or disaster to proactively collect more information about the specic news stories However viewers didnít actively switch the channels to positive news stories such as those covering a Nobel Prize aware or the Rugby World Cup the viewers instead passively watched the stories Table 3 also shows the accumulated airtime of each news story The murder cases that were ranked in our results but not ranked by the      Q1: In what type of news are people interested Q2: What makes audiences watch drama Q3: What is the key indicator to increase ratings for variety shows  A: People are interested in weather reports and sports news  A: People tend to stay on a channel in serious scenes when the screen becomes dark  A: People want lively scenes with high entropy in variety shows Blue Black Entropy Amusement Dominance Weather  report Green Sports news Filter  news Filter  drama Filter  variey Filter  news, remove object \(85 Remove weather report a b c Figure 6 Examples of analyzing user behavior using the proposed mining system to detect an increase in ratings for a specific category These examples answer questions about a news b drama and c variety shows AprilñJune 2017 51 


Yomiuri newspaper the Osaka Kawasaki and Wakayama murder cases were ranked highly in airtime while the important news stories that were not detected by our method such as the launch of Hokuriku Shinkansen also received much airtime This indicates that TV stations broadcast important news stories equally to some extent regardless of peopleís level of interest while news stories of public interest receive more airtime We also analyzed how the information related to a disaster is broadcast and viewed We compared the three disasters the ooding of the Kinugawa River on 10 September 2015 Figure 8a the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011 Figure 8b and the Great Hanshin/Awaji Earthquake on 10 January 1995 Figure 8c We extracted the broadcasting time for each disaster with appropriate keywords and compared the three disasters using airtime and ratings within the broadcasting time Figure 8 shows the accumulated airtime per day and the highest per-minute rating in a day within broadcasting time for each of the three disasters Airtime is indicative of the TV stations intent while we used the highest per-minute rating to show what percentage of people watched news about the disaster that day This result shows that the ooding of the Kinugawa received the most airtime Figure 8a and many people watched the broadcast 26 percent which is signicantly high in Japan On the other hand the Great Hanshin Earthquake which occurred 20 years earlier was not as widely broadcast and thus had lower ratings Figure 8c Although ratings for the Great East Japan Earthquake which happened four years before the Kinugawa ooding are not as significant as for the ooding on that particular day 11 March 2011 TV stations spent a lot of time broadcasting the disaster and nearly 20 percent of potential viewers were watching Moreover this event occurred between two holidays which also might have been a contributing factor in terms of the number of people watching This suggests the intention of   Q4: When do people switch the channel in news programs Q5: Do animals inﬂuence ratings Q6: How did the audience behave when the Kinugawa River ﬂooded  A: People tend to switch channels during news commentary, parliamentary proceedings, and live broadcasts in the dark  A: Animals inﬂuence ratings, especially for variety shows, except for animals in water  A: People tended to watch live broadcasts and switch the channel when the scene changed Brown Distribution of animal scores for each program category News Blue Gray Example of increase points Example of decrease Information Drama Variety Black Blue Filter  news Filter  news reject object \(18, 82, 67 Filter  animal>0.3 Filter  news+information keyword \(Kinugawa Remove some objects a b c Figure 7 Examples of analyzing user behavior using the proposed mining system to a detect a rating decrease for news programs b determine whether animals contribute to ratings and c detect audience behavior related to an event IEEE MultiMedia 52
