The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer \(CAPS in-situ instrument and is one of 12 instruments on the orbiter Cruise science \(beyond instrument checkout periods and periodic maintenance\ was approved, and over 870 days of data were collected prior to the start of the prime mission Prime mission operations started in January 2004 and continued through end of June 2008.  Given the success of the Cassini mission at Saturn, an extended mission, the Equinox Mission, was approved for an a dditional two years, ending September 2010.  The continuing success of the Equinox 
mission led to approval of a se cond extended mission called the Solstice Mission.  The Solstice mission has approval through September 2012 with pending approval through July 2017 The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer \(CAPS\ has generated a wealth of science data and we have over 240 publications.  In addition, the CAPS scientists participate in conferences, interteam collaborations, and community outreach.  Collection of data has not been without instrument related challenges This paper will discuss a few of the in-flight instrument related anomalies experienced by CAPS including timing difference between the engineering model and the flight model, actuator related anomalies, and a latched bit.  The analysis will cover how the anomalies were discovered, the techniques used to diagnose the problems in-flight, fixes that were implemented 
how the anomalies affected operation of the instrument and collection of science, and lessons learned from the process T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  CAPS  I NSTRUMENT 2  3  CAPS  F LIGHT S OFTWARE U PDATE P ROCESS 2  4  CAPS  F LIGHT S OFTWARE V ERSIONS

Cassini was approved by Congress in 1989 as part of a larger CRAF Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby\/Cassini program and 
was planned for launch in 1995 with CRAF following in 1996.  However, in 1992 there was a major reorganization that cut the CRAF portion out of the budget and the Cassini program funding was reduced [1  Due  t o rest ruct uri n g the launch date slipped and launch was performed October 15, 1997.  Cassini launched in 1997 and entered the Saturn system on July 1, 2004.  The main Cassini mission involved a 4-year prime mission around Sa turn to conduct the first indepth, up-close study of the ringed planet and its domain Near the end of the prime mission, the Cassini project negotiated with the NASA for a 2-year extended mission This extended mission, the Cassini Equinox Mission, was 
approved by NASA to conduct further studies of the Saturnian system, including observing Saturn during a total solar eclipse.  As the Equinox mission progressed and the scientific value of the data being returned was increasing the Cassini scientists went back in negotiation with NASA to fund a second extended mission \(Solstice Mission\he Solstice Mission has been funded until end of September 2012, with a standing request to fund until July 2017.  The main science goals of this second extended mission will be to observe seasonal variations as one \(1 equivalent to 29.7 Earth years 


  2 The Cassini Plasma Spectrome ter \(CAPS\ is one of six fields, particles and waves” instruments on the Cassini orbiter set to detect charged particles and plasmas and to study the interactions between Saturn, its moons and the solar wind  The C A PS i n st rum e nt i s ope rat e d f r o m  Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, TX Budget cuts continued to plague Cassini, which were handled in various ways.  One way to reduce cost during development was the removal of the high-precision scan platform and turntable that would have de-coupled the interactions between the magnetospheric and plasma science MAPS\nstruments and all the other instruments.  It was not until much later, that the full effects of the removal of this platform were discovered [2 i n cl udi ng t h e nee d t o  negotiate pointing and spacecraft operating modes, and much later, dealing with the issues arising from overuse of the spacecraft reaction wheels Another method of cost reduction was to implement distributed operations.  Given that the responsibility for instrument design resided at the Principle Investigator’s \(PI home institution, there was no need to have instrument representatives at JPL.  It was decided to keep the expertise in-house at the PI institution by distributing the operations responsibility.  This distribution reduces the communication and approval layers in the operations processes and frees the ground system to be more flexible.  An additional reason to choose distributed operations was empowerment.  The PIs were now fully responsible for their instrument from the design phase all the way th rough operations, including building instrument commands, instrument monitoring, and archiving [5  One ot her a s pect ari s i n g f r om di st ri but e d  operations was the manner in which instrument teams participate in anomalies.  Instrument teams are fully responsible for anomalies associ ated with their instruments including, but not limited to, discovery, reporting, meetings analysis, and resolution.  Instrument teams are involved to a lesser extent with spacecraft anomalies.  Instrument teams still participate in meetings and gather data for the spacecraft team or other instruments when data is requested  2  CAPS  I NSTRUMENT  The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer \(CAPS\consists of an Ion Mass Spectrometer \(IMS\n El ectron Spectrometer \(ELS an Ion Beam Spectrometer \(IBS\n Actuator \(ACT\nd a Data Processing Unit \(DPU\e DPU consists of two \(2 Central Processing Unit \(CPU1 and CPU2\ boards, each of which contains one 1750A microprocessor. Data from the IMS is acquired and processe d by the Spectrum Analyzer Module \(SAM\hich also contains a 1750A microprocessor The CAPS instrument is assigned power, data rate, and memory resources on a daily basis during the mission. Data resources are allocated by volume on the spacecraft solid state recorder \(SSR\ Management of the CAPS data volume is done through the choice of operating modes and data compression strategy. CAPS commands are uplinked to the spacecraft and stored in th e CAPS memory as command sequences. Triggers for executing these command sequences are stored in the CDS comm and sequence. The command triggers are time-tagged and are sent by the CDS to CAPS for execution at the appropriate time. During the Prime mission and Equinox phases, uplink of a large background sequence took place once every 28 days.  During the Solstice Mission, the time betw een large sequence uploads has been lengthened to approximately every 70 days, with the goal to reduce the total number of overlapping sequences and hence the staff needed to support the work The Cassini Project's concept of Instrument Expanded Blocks \(IEB\ and “distributed processing” were used in implementing the CAPS command process Flight software on CPU1 is designed as an interrupt driven data acquisition, control, and telemetry production subsystem.  Interrupt routines provide the time-critical foreground processing for the flight system.  These routines maintain CAPS sample clock time base and synchronization with the spacecraft control and monitor actuator movement acquire science and housekeeping monitor data from the ELS and IBS sensors, coordinate the BIU \(bus interface unit\ and CPU2 interface functions, and provide a watchdog timer function.  The CPU1 flight software main routine provides background processing that includes data compress, data product generation, telemetry formatting and the non-time-cr itical subset of command execution Flight software on CPU2 is mainly science processing software which accepts and processes a smaller, unique subset of commands. At initial start up, it configures the Time to Digital Converter \(TDC\ SAM to their previous operating state \(this current state is constantly maintained by CPU2, and can be altered via commands to CPU1 or CPU2\itializes buffers counters and housekeeping; and starts the SAM processor. CPU2 obtains Time of Flight TOF\ and Ion data from SAM and Singles and Logicals from the TDC and buffers this data. The data products of the correct format, which is dependant on data rate, are created from the buffered data and are passed to CPU1 Housekeeping is maintained and passed to CPU1 The TDC provides high \(LEF\nd medium \(ST\ resolution TOF measurements based on signals from the IMS sensor This TOF data is passed to SAM for processing. The TDC also provides a built in test \(BIT\ich generates known TOF values for testing purposes  3  CAPS  F LIGHT S OFTWARE U PDATE P ROCESS  CAPS flight software follows a rigorous process for updates.  First, a general discussion among the science team takes place to determine if any changes need to be made in the science products.  The scientists are responsible for determining how the allotted data should be allocated 


  3 among the three sensors and the actuator.  Data from each sensor can either be sampled or collapsed.  Collapses can be done in energy or time, and can either be averaged or summed across energy, time, or space Second, other enhancements ar e identified by the science team, operations team, or flight software engineer.  Desired changes are collected in a CAPS Flight Software Delta Software Requirements Docu ment, and approved by all relevant parties.  The flight software is then coded Extensive testing is planned via the Verification Test Plan Testing is performed on the CAPS engineering model located at Southwest Research Institute.  After successfully completing the tests, data was ingested into the CAPS ground system and cursory check s were made to verify the ability to run data end-to-end After the flight software has been tested, a meeting is held with JPL to discuss and a ccept the delivery of flight software for upload to the sp acecraft.  After approval, the flight software is loaded onto the spacecraft non-default partition.  Checkout of the flight software commences on the date negotiated with project \(typically requiring extra data volume and real-time data contact\When the flight software has been fully checked out in flight, a copy of the new flight software is written to the default partition erasing the older version from the spacecraft  4  CAPS  F LIGHT S OFTWARE V ERSIONS  Given the early budget limitations and the complexity of the system, it was decided to launch the instrument with a limited set of flight software functionality.  The full flight software specification for CAPS included seven telemetry modes.  One of the ways CAPS handled limited functionality was to implement only two telemetry modes for launch in October 1997, allowing the operations team to handle checkout activities and a limited number of science observations.  These modes were also used during early cruise operations.  After the project approved science at Jupiter, the schedule for a fuller \(and more flexible\version of flight software was accelerat ed.  The updated version of the flight software \(version 3.1\was loaded into CAPS in July 2000.  Given the accelerated schedule, only five of the seven modes were designed, implemented, and uploaded to support Jupiter science \(in mid 2000 After Jupiter and additional cruise science were collected the spacecraft flight software group \(which had also launched with a limited set of functionality\ired instruments to power-off to allow an update to the spacecraft flight software prio r to the start of the Prime mission.  Given that the instruments would be off during the spacecraft flight software update period, the CAPS scientists assessed the science return and the scientists decided that the telemetry modes could be more efficiently designed and that some added functionality would be nice.  So requirements were written and approved for a new version of flight software.  The re lease included changes to accommodate changing spacecraf t flight software, bug fixes, almost an entirely revised set of telemetry modes, and added in extensive, new capabilities for the IBS sensor Flight software version 4.0 was uplinked in July 2003 and ran for only 30 hours prior to crashing.  Problems at that point were unknown, as there was a lot of new functionality that had been added.  The CAPS team took version 4.0 back into development.  Version 4.0.1 was built that fixed the stability of version 4.0, without compromising the added functionality.  Version 4.0.1 was rigorously tested on the engineering unit and passed reliability testing.  Version 4.0.1 was submitted to the project in November 2003 for uplink  5  CAPS  F LIGHT S OFTWARE T IMING A NOMALY  Flight software version 4.0.1 was uploaded in late December 2003.  Checkout star ted on December 22, 2003 It was obvious from the first science plots that something was very wrong.  Before the instrument was turned off for the spacecraft flight software update on February 8, 2003 the science data looked fine \(s ee Figure 1\ry few data drop-outs and the sweeping of the supplies was very steady.  After the new fli ght software was loaded, there were many drop-outs \(see Figure 2\he sweeping of the supplies appeared incorrect At the beginning of the investigation, the CAPS team was unsure if the spacecraft was picking up all the packets that CAPS generated, or if  Figure 1: Good ELS data pre-version 4.0.1 upload 


  4 the CAPS instrument was not generating all the appropriate packets \(or was generating corrupted packets\hecking the expected packet count vers us the received packet count within spacecraft housekeepi ng confirmed CAPS was not producing the correct number of packets for pickup.  Hence it likely ruled out there being an issue with the new spacecraft flight software  Figure 2: Electron Spectrometer data after version 4.0.1 flight software was uplinked On December 27, the dropped packets issue and extra sweeping within the ELS se nsor seemed to clear up abruptly, without any extern al input \(see Figure 3 However, the IMS data products still had dropout problems see Figure 4\.  Given that the IMS data products were still having dropouts, it was decided to reset CPU2, to see if resyncing the CPUs would help.  The reset was done on January 15, 2004 \(see Figure 5\, and the results were generally good Digging through the housekeeping it was noted that the number of missed and extra real-time interrupt \(RTI counters was increasing.  The RTI signal is maintained by the spacecraft and is broadcast to the instrument every 125 milliseconds.  The RTI is the mechanism by which the instrument is able to keep sync with the spacecraft clock and to control processes within the flight software \(like the sweeping of voltages, stepping of the actuator, collection of data, and processing and transmission of collected data Missed RTIs are generated when the RTI is not processed when the instrument is expecting it.  An extra RTI would be counted if the instrument were to artificially generate one that it thought was missed \(and th en counts the “real” one as well as the generated one\  This observation gave us a starting point to track down the anomaly  Figure 3: Electron spectrometer data appears to clear up  Figure 4: IMS data product \(Singles\s a little better but still has issues 


  5  Figure 5:  IMS Singles data before and after a re-sync with CPU1 Due to the time-frame of the flight software update, and the value of the science during this period, the bulk of the investigation was restricted to troubleshooting the flight software on the engineering unit \(even though the effects seen in-flight were not initially reproducible on the engineering unit\ After the high-value science campaign for Saturn-inbound solar-wind measurements was completed in early February 2004, further investigation was initiated in-flight Between February 9 and March 19, the instrument was rebooted several times and with varying configurations None of the reboots returned the instrument to its pre-4.0 version of data integrity.  On March 25, the instrument was turned on and a patch was loaded to the RTI timing window to see if it could be extended to avoid missing the spacecraft RTI.  Data looked better after this patch.  The team took the power on very slowly.  High voltage was turned on to the ELS sensor on April 9 and the IMS sensor on April 10 Data from this time period seemed to be fairly clean.  There were a few drop-outs, but they were not bad \(see Figure 6 With the testing done after March 25, the CAPS team discovered a combination of sub-systems and modes that allowed for relatively clean data collection.  Unfortunately on May 14 the instrument started exhibiting a different set of problems \(see Figure 7\.  Given that SOI \(Saturn orbital insertion\ was rapidly appro aching, the sequence leads didn’t want to take on a lot of additional work to build commands for the CAPS instru ment.  The decision for division of labor was passed to project management  Figure 6:  April 11 data fo r IMS singles, where data appears fairly clean   Figure 7:  ELS data from May 14, showing a very different data problem 


  6 Project management weighed the possibilities of loss of science during orbital insertion to the additional work load to be handled by the sequence leads and it was decided to allow CAPS commanding to recover the instrument to a good science collection state fo r SOI.  The instrument was rebooted on May 27, but it failed to return to the pre May 14 clean state.  Another reboot was performed on June 4, and the instrument response was much better \(see Figure 8  Figure 8:  IMS Singles Data on June 7, after a reboot During the time from December 2003 through July 2004 the engineering model at Southwest Research was running the exact same sequence that wa s running in flight.  There was no indication from the engineering model data of any missed or extra RTIs, where in flight we were seeing many spurious” RTIs.  Given that that the RTI counters were increasing, the flight software engineer added no-operation NO-OP\ts \(with timing waits\to the code to see if the problem could be duplicated on the ground.  It was discovered that, in fact, the problem could be reproduced on the ground by adding enough NO-OP commands, and it ultimately required approximately a 700 micro-second wait in order to generate a similar problem on the ground.  This pointed to a difference between the run time of the flight software between the engineering unit and the flight unit and the flight unit runs approximately 700 micro-seconds slower than the engineering unit.  It turns out that all the new functionality for the IBS sensor was causing the flight software on the flight unit to overrun the allocated run-time This caused the interrupt routines to miss RTIs and see extra RTIs where it didn’t expect them.  This problem was entirely software related and not a hardware issue The solution to the difference in timing was to comment out one of the newer capabilities added for the IBS sensor:  the ability to be able to track the solar wind direction.  This piece of code was running in th e background even when the mode was not being actively used.  The reason was that if the mode was called, information was available in order to set up the routine correctly.  By removing this code from the background processing, enough time was saved to compensate for the slower running code on the flight unit Saturn Orbital Insertion took place on July 1, 2004 and the CAPS instrument performed without incident and the science return was full \(very few dropouts of data instrument was powered-off for a few days after SOI for higher priority activities and when turned back on July 12 the CAPS team included a patch that commented out the IBS search and track code.  Data following the July 12 power on and patch appear very clean \(see Figure 9  Figure 9:  ELS sensor data after the July 12 patch Ultimately the CAPS was able to discover the cause behind the anomalous behavior of the version 4.0.1 of flight software:  a difference in how long it takes the code to run in flight versus on the engineering unit on the ground.  The base reason it is running slower was never determined, but given the solution, it was not required to know.  For nine months, the data coming from the instrument was not very clean.  For science use, it to ok extra work to remove any suspect data before being able to use the data for publication and discovery purposes.   Although the process to clean up the data was lengthy, most of the data was still useable 


  7 The engineering model flight software has been modified to have a wait of approximately 700 micro-seconds during each RTI period.  Any future builds of the software maintain sufficient margin so as to avoid this timing issue in the future builds of flight software.  This additional wait is stripped when a load is built to be delivered to the flight unit.  The operations team ha s alarms in place to track any spurious RTIs in the system to make sure additional timing creep isn’t taking place  6  A CTUATOR I SSUES  The CAPS instrument has an actuator that moves the slits of the sensors in order to view the sky.  Originally, the spacecraft was to be built with a scan platform that would move all the in-situ instruments as a group to view the sky while leaving the spacecraft at a viewing attitude for the remote sensing instruments, ie cameras\ stated earlier in the introduction, due to budget restrictions, the scan platform was de-scoped.  As a result, the CAPS instrument procured an actuator.  The actuator was built at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, and integrated onto the CAPS instrument at Southwest Research Institute.  The sensors hang off the actuator \(see Figure 10  Figure 10:  Cassini Plasma Sp ectrometer, the actuator is on the top, with the sensors suspended below it The actuator has a stepper motor and was designed to operate over a range of 208 degrees.  The actuator has a wobble compensation routine, whose intent was to avoid transferring any jerky motio n onto the spacecraft and to keep the CAPS instrument moving smoothly.  Initial software used the position monitor to feed the wobble compensation routine, as well as the routine that decided how large the next step should be in order to match the desired rate \(typically 1 degree per second\  Due to an earlier incident not discussed here, the actuation range was limited to 188 degrees, and the typical time to actuate the full range was around 212 seconds \(allowing for a deceleration and acceleration when turning the corner CAPS used its actuator for ~751 days without any suspicious incidents during early Cruise from January 20 1999 until October 5, 2002, when the 5 Volt \(V\onitor started reading 0 as illustrated by Figure 11.  All values in the housekeeping stream were scrubbed to see if anything else was showing values that were unexpected.  The actuator values were also scrutinized, as well as the science to verify that even though the voltage monitor was reporting 0, the actuator will still running.  After several weeks of intensive investigation with the actuator builders and the engineers at Southwest Research who integrated the actuator onto the instrument, nothing was found to account for the failure.  In fact, the builders of the actuator indicated that if the monitor value was truly 0V as indicated by the monitor the actuator would have been dead.  Hence, a report was made and the limit for the channel was changed to account for the new, unplanned value  Figure 11:  Plot of the actuator 5V monitor failure On July 1, 2004, the actuator 5V monitor started showing 5V again.  At the same time, the 20V monitor for the actuator started reading 0 \(see Figure 12\Again housekeeping was scrubbed, and science looked through to verify that the actuator was indeed still operational.  The engineers went back to th e actuator board layout and scrubbed how the information was transmitted to housekeeping, but could not find any correlation between location on the boards for the 20V monitor and the 5V monitor.  There was some activity on the spacecraft around the time of this failure, but it could not be tied directly to causing an issue with the failure/recovery of the monitors Given that the actuator was still running, a report was generated, alarms updated, and a closer eye was kept on the actuator data On August 23, 2004, the 20V monitor started showing 20V again as shown in Figure 13.  Once again, housekeeping was scrubbed, and science looked through to verify that the actuator was indeed still operational.  There were again activities on board the spacecraft but it still seemed unlikely that those events would cause the monitor to just start working correctly again.  Given that the actuator was still 


  8 running, another report was generated, alarms updated, and an even closer eye was kept on the actuator data  Figure 12:  Actuator 5V monitor recovery and 20V monitor failure  Figure 13:  Actuator 20V monitor recovery On December 17, 2004, the actuator hardware monitor, used as feedback for stepping the act uator, quit reporting correct values as shown in Figure 14.  Additionally, the actuator temperature monitor started reporting a value of 0 \(or -47.9 when converted\Given that the position monitor was reporting incorrectly, it was not useful to run the actuator The current actuator position was thought to be approximately -60 degrees, based on science data correlated with other Cassini instruments.  On January 27, 2005, the actuator was commanded to move to +104.  Given that the actuator was built with hard stops, we could slowly step into the hard stop and verify our belief that we were ~-60 degrees.  The test ran successfully, and moved the actuator Fortunately, the broken actuator position monitor did not interfere with the move.  The CAPS team continued work on the problem  Figure 14:  Actuator hardware position monitor failure On February 26, 2005, CAPS sent commanding to move the actuator from +104 to +90 degrees The goal was to set up the actuator for a high priority science observation that would be coming up within a few months.  Based on how the actuator operates, in order to get to +90, we needed first to turn the corner at +6 2 degrees which allows the acceleration and deceleration tabl e to be “played” through stopping us at +90.  From the data, we know that the instrument turned the corner at +62 degrees and was headed back towards +90.  About 24 seconds later, the actuator did an abrupt direction change and started heading in the negative direction and continued that way until power was removed from the actuator, stopping it at about -14 degrees On March 5, 2005, the instrument team downlinked some data from the spacecraft to determine whether the actuator was commanded to “go positive” or “go negative”.  It turned out that the actuator had the correct instructions it just wasn’t moving in the commanded direction While the operations team was trying to figure out what was happening when commanding the instrument in a positive direction, the flight software engineer was busy trying to work the problem with the position monitor.  After discussion with VTT, they were surprised that the software was using the hardware monitor to control the unit.  They had always thought it was being used as a true stepper motor, and that the software was counting steps \(as is intended in such motors\o, the flight software engineer was busy re-writing the actuator software to handle counting steps and ignoring the broken position monitor.  In addition to the update for the actuator, the new version of flight software would incorporate the code changes that were needed to fix the difference in timing between the flight unit and the engineering model As changes to flight software progressed, a few more tests were done in flight.  The ultimate goal was to move the actuator to +90 degrees fo r the high value science observation that would be taki ng place in May 2005.  A few attempts were made, but each time, it would play to the end of the acceleration table and then abruptly stop positive 


  9 motion and start running in a negative direction.  So, on March 22, 2005, the actuator was commanded to run in the positive direction for 42 seconds, multiple times.  Each 42 second interval gave the actuator time to get most of the way through its acceleration table and to move the actuator about 10 degrees.  The commanding on March 22 was successful in moving the actuat or close to +90 degrees \(it was estimated that we achieved +88 degrees\So, prior to the high value science activity in April 2005, we were able to position the actuator for more optimal science return On March 23, 2005, the CAPS team performed a dump of the memory associated with actuation.  It intended to look at the hardware register associat ed with the actuator wobble compensation feedback to see if we could determine if something in the routine was causing the actuator to run backwards.  With the actuator motionless, the feedback value was incorrect, essentially indicating to the flight software to "slow down the actuator". This incorrect value was also observed while the actuator was powered on. The net result by the flight software was to “in essence” run the actuator backwards.  We looked into the specific circuits and components that may have failed, but were unable to pinpoint anything in particular.  It was determined that there was a sticky bit \(or set of sticky bits\at could no longer be overwritten.  Because these values were within the wobble compensation routine, it was decided to run without wobble compensation turned on The flight software update was completed on July 6, 2005 The data was scrutinized by the CAPS team members and scientists to verify that the changes didn’t affect the science being returned.  Final, full-on actuation was started on September 1, 2005.  The actuator was now running without wobble compensation and with a new routine for determining the current position of the actuator.  The actuator temperature monitor is currently still reading 0 There still remains an unknown cause for the failure of this monitor The work on the discovery of these actuator problems and their subsequent fixes was long and tedious.  Discovering the wobble compensation issue required some diligent sleuthing to dig through each routine to ferret out any possibilities of trouble.  Trying to troubleshoot the change in direction problem in-flight was difficult, especially when the problem can not be reproduced on the ground However, with a stroke of luck and making use of all of the available avenues, we were able to determine the cause.  As for the position monitor, it was fortuitous that there was another way in which to command the actuator without using the hardware position monitor reading Although the actuator problems kept us at a fixed attitude for almost 9 months, the value of the science was only slightly degraded.  Yes, it would have been ideal to be viewing the sky for the entire period, but with our limited tools, the highest value science was not sacrificed Additionally, the flight software and operations group were diligent in their efforts to uncover the problems and to find alternate solutions for continued, full-up operations  7  A NOTHER S TICKY B IT  Operations between September 1, 2005 and March 27, 2008 went fairly smoothly.  On March 27 about noon, the spacecraft turned the CAPS inst rument off after seeing a solid state power switch \(SSPS trip.  Trips don’t happen very frequently, but when they do, the standard response is to put the instrument into a safe state, as the previous state is unknown.  The safe state for an instrument is to be poweredoff with the replacement heater on.  This wasn’t a big problem for CAPS, as the spacecraft team has always been very accommodating in turning instruments back on in a timely manner.  Per normal pro cedure, the CAPS operations team built a power-on sequence to turn the instrument back on On March 29, 2008, commands were sent to be executed on board to power on the instrument.  About 19 minutes into the power-on, the CAPS instrument rebooted itself back into PROM unexpectedly.  Looking at the data on the ground, it was determined that the reset occurred after the CPU1 and CPU2 watchdog timers and actuator commands were sent The belief at the time was that the CPU1 watchdog timer expired \(possibly because the actuator commanding was sent prior to the watchdogs\causing the reset On April 2, 2008,  a cleaned up set of commands were sent to be executed on board to power on the instrument, perform a memory readout \(MRO\f the entire flight software code space, and then to re-enable th e Watchdog timers.  Just as on March 29, the instrument rebooted.  However, based on the timing waits in place on April 2, it was found that the instrument rebooted immediately when the CPU1 watchdog command was received, NOT 32 seconds later, when the watchdog timer would have expired Between April 2 and 4, the MRO data was scrubbed and the single discrepancy found was not related to the watchdog region code.  This lead the team to believe that there was likely a hardware problem with the watchdog circuit itself The hard question was then to decide if the instrument could be operated without the CPU1 watchdog timer.  After consideration that CAPS had run for ~11 years \(including ground test time before launch\without ever tripping the watchdog timer, it was decided that the team would try running the instrument without the CPU1 watchdog enabled while stimulating the circuits with pre-patterned noise STIM\.  This would allow verification that other hardware was un-affected by the loss of the watchdog circuit On April 8, the CAPS instrument was powered on without the CPU1 watchdog enabled \(the CPU2 watchdog is still being used but it does not control the ability for CAPS to reset itself\ The instrument was configured with all the sensors in STIM and operated in that manner for several 


  10 days.  Analysis of the raw data did not yield any discrepancies On April 10, after discussion with the primary investigator the operations team, and the f light software engineer, it was decided to turn CAPS on with high voltages and return to normal science operations without the watchdog timer operating.  In theory, without the watchdog timer, the flight software might go into a state from which it could not be recovered.  However, there had never been an event of that type in the history of the instrument and so the risk was extremely small in terms of mean-time-between-failures On the other hand, given that the watchdog timer currently had the ability to turn the instrument off in a way that was not understood and believed to involve a bit in the hardware not being able to accept an updated value, it was conceivable that the watchdog timer could turn CAPS off for good. Overall, there was less risk in operating the instrument with the CPU1 watchdog timer turned off After operations began with the watchdog timer off, the instrument was monitored more closely to verify that no anomalies were occurring in the data.  Another means of monitoring the data was to build an automated alarmchecking program that sends em ails when channels are outof-range.  Although the space craft does have alarm checking in place, the values of interest were not able to be checked through their tools.  Alarm checking at the spacecraft level is to check the general tolerances on items like temperatures.  Additionally the spacecraft alarm checking was only active during real-time contact with the spacecraft CAPS wanted the ability to be able to check all the data, as well as data that was not just a simple state or range check The tool was able to check the variance between what a high voltage supply was commanded to versus what the monitor value was showing.  This allowed a greater range of alarms to be implemented as well as offering the team greater flexibility to add and modify al arms as well.  Because the new tool was placed inline with nightly processing, it made checking the instrument stat e checking more in-depth convenient and faster This anomaly could have totally affected our ability to collect science, if we were unab le to determine root cause Due to methodical checking, the cause was uncovered.  The fix in this case involved asse ssing the risks associated with several courses of action or non-action.  After some risk analysis, it was determined that running the instrument with the CPU1 watchdog disabled wa s less of a risk than trying to find a way to allow it to run  8  C ONCLUSIONS L ESSONS L EARNED  The CAPS instrument has experi enced a few different types of anomalies during its lifetime.  In each case, the operations, flight software, and science teams worked diligently to assess the problem and develop solutions to allow continuation of science collection.  Persistence in looking through all the data slowly and trying different combinations of states and commanding are vital in the search for answers.  In the case of the 5V, 20V, and temperature monitor failures in the instrument, much work was done to see if a root cause could be found to explain why the monitors would fail \(and then return to operation Even with all the work, a root cause was not found.  The instrument team is grateful that the actuator has continued to operate in spite of the monitor failures The experiences with these anomalies have led us to improve our processes for finding and fixing anomalies The flight software specific anomalies have led us to modify the testing and approval process for new flight software to be more extensive and rigorous It has also made the team more risk sensitive to uploading new software.  Finally, we learned that some of the initial designs should have been different from the beginning.  These lessons learned are being collected and applied by the operations team members to future instruments and operations  9  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The CAPS investigation was developed by Southwest Research Institute under JPL Contract No. 1243218 and is currently operated by Southwest Research Institute under JPL Contract No. 1405851
