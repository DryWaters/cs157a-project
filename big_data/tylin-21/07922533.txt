Z Sun et al  Identifying Influential Nodes in Complex Networks Based on WFCA  TABLE 5 The ranking list is generated by the eight algorithms Owing to space limitations we only show the top-10 nodes of two networks including one directed network and one undirected network where K-s H-i denotes K-shell and H-index respectively 050a\051 Aviation 050b\051 Euroroad FIGURE 6 The propagation influence of the ranking lists is generated by the eight algorithms F\050t\051 denotes the number of infected and recovered nodes at time t 050t=500\051 and ranked index represents the order of ranking list 050a\051 Aviation 050b\051 Protein 050c\051 Blogs 050d\051 Powergrid 050e\051 Euroroad 050f\051 Friendships 050g\051 Ca-Astroph 050h\051 DBLP value is n  So the complexity of calculating node weight is O 050 nL 051 In summary the time complexity of WFCA algorithm is the sum of the three parts namely O 050 n 2 C n 2 L C nL 051 As we know n 2 024 n 2 L  nL 024 n 2 L  Therefore the time complexity is O 050 n 2 L 051 We can see the time complexity of WFCA is not very low but its accuracy is better than the other algorithms\050cf Fig 5-7\051 3784 VOLUME 5 2017 


Z Sun et al  Identifying Influential Nodes in Complex Networks Based on WFCA  TABLE 6 The influences F\050t\051 is obtained by top-10 different nodes of ranking lists between WFCA and other algorithms in Aviation network In future work we plan to extend WFCA as a paralleling method IV EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION A DATA DESCRIPTION In this section we evaluate WFCA on eight representative real-world networks selected from distinct 034elds including one transportation network 050Aviation\051 one biological network 050Protein\051 one information network 050Blogs\051 two infrastructure networks 050Powergird and Euroroad\051 one social network 050Friendships\051 two collaboration networks 050Ca-AstroPh and DBLP\051 In brief Aviation is an air traf\034c control network of USA's FAA 050Federal Aviation Administration\051 and this is a directed network Protein is a directed network of interactions between proteins in Humans Our Blogs is a directed network which contains front-page hyperlinks between blogs in the context of the 2004 US election Our Powergird network contains information about the power grid of the Western States of America and this is undirected Euroroad is the international E-road undirected network which located mostly in Europe Our Friendships is an undirected network which contains friendships between users of the website hamsterster.com Ca-AstroPh is a collaboration graph of authors of scienti\034c papers from the arXiv's Astrophysics 050astro-ph\051 section And DBLP is an attributed network of computer science bibliography To extensively study the performance of our algorithm we compare WFCA with several representative in\035uential node detection algorithms namely PageRank 050PR\051 HITS eigenvector centrality 050EC\051 K-shell H-index closeness centrality 050CC\051 and betweenness centrality 050BC\051 The statistics of the eight networks datasets are presented in Table 4 and they are all publicly available from KONECT 050http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/\051 and the DBLP dataset 050http://dblp.uni-trier.de/\051 B MEASUREMENT In this paper we employ the SIR model to in v estig ate the spreading in\035uences of ranked nodes There are three components to such a system 050I\051 Susceptible 050S\051 denotes the susceptible individuals who are not yet infected 050II\051 Infected 050I\051 represents the infected individuals who may spread the disease to susceptible individuals 050III\051 Recovered 050R\051 stands for recovered individuals who can never be infected again The SIR model begins with one or more seed nodes Then the seed nodes infect adjacent nodes with a probability of 025  Next the infected nodes recover with a probability of 026  Finally the infected and recovered nodes are used to calculate the spreading in\035uences of seed nodes Each loop of spreading is regarded as a time step t  F 050 t 051 denotes the number of infected and recovered nodes at time t  which is an indicator of the node importance Obviously F 050 t 051 will gradually converge as the time t evolves trending towards to a certain level To evaluate the performances of different in\035uential node identi\034cation algorithms Kendall 034 is introduced to measure the correlation of the node spreading in\035uence with the eight methods Kendall's tau as a rank correlation coef\034cient is usually used to measure the correlation between two ranking list We assume that two sequences associated with the same number of nodes n  X D 050 x 1  x 2      x n 051 and Y D 050 y 1  y 2      y n 051 Any pair of two-tuples 050 x i  y i 051 and 050 x j  y j 051 050 i 6D j 051 are said to be concordant if the ranks for both elements agree that is if both x i  x j and y i  y j or if both x i  x j and y i  y j  They are said to be discordant if x i  x j and y i  y j or if x i  x j and y i  y j  If x i D x j or y i D y j  the VOLUME 5 2017 3785

0  5 n 050 n 000 1\051 0504\051 In which n c and n d represent the number of concordant and discordant pairs respectively One can note that 034 2  000 1   is positively related to concordant of the ranking lists The higher 034 value is the more accurate the ranking list the method could generate C PERFORMANCE EVALUATION In this experiment to better distinguish the importance of nodes we use relatively small values of 025 in SIR model namely 025 2 0  01  0   Because with a lar ge 025  the spreading would cover almost all the network Fig 5 sho ws Kendall's 034 of the WFCA method where the ranking lists are generated by the PR HITS EC K-shell H-index CC and BC As shown in Fig 5c the Kendall's 034 for the WFCA is between 0.8 and 0.9 for 025 2 0  01  0   indicating that the ranking lists generated by the WFCA and the real SIR spreading process are basically identical to each other From Fig 5 we can see that there are different performances for the different algorithms and the WFCA method performs well on different types of networks For instance for directed networks 050Aviation Protein and Blogs\051 and undirect networks 050Powergrid Euroroad and Ca-AstroPh\051 WFCA performs the best For the Friendships network EC and HITS have the best performance and the WFCA also has a better effect than the others In DBLP networks the EC algorithm achieves the best performance the WFCA method still provides a comparatively good performance and performs better than other algorithms Note that the performances of K-shell BC and CC are not good in Aviation Protein Blogs and Powergrid networks Because the K-shell algorithm is coarse-grained on the network division and the nodes of each layer are seen as equally important but in fact they are not Therefore for the network with small number of layers the effect is relatively poor On the contrary for multiple layers network the effect is better For the BC method there are many nodes whose values are the same because these nodes have the same number of shortest paths through them And the cc algorithm also has the same problem The performance of H-index method is also not good in directed networks 050Aviation Protein and Blogs\051 As you can see WFCA performs well not only in undirected networks but also in directed networks To further compares the propagation performance of the algorithms we investigate the spreading in\035uences of ranked nodes in SIR model Without loss of generality we set the infection probability 025 D 0  1 recovery probability 026 D 1  45 and time step t D 500 First we compute the in\035uence of each node using the various algorithms and rank them in descending order Table 5 presents the top-L ranked nodes Owing to space limitations we only display the top10 nodes of two networks including one directed network Aviation and one undirected network Euroroad We can see that most nodes of top-10 of WFCA are presented in other algorithms so the WFCA method has better accuracy than other algorithms For further evaluation each ranked node is considered as the seed node 050with only one seed node for each run\051 Finally we calculate the number of infected nodes for each seed node by averaging over 1000 implementations Fig 6 illustrates the average numbers of infected nodes ranked by the eight different algorithms A good algorithm should result in a downward slope from left to right that is the number of infected nodes should decrease as L increases This is because the more important a node is the more infected nodes there are Thus this node ranks higher In the Aviation Protein Blogs Powergrid Euroroad and aCa-AstroPh networks WFCA performs the best among all eight algorithms For the Friendships and DBLP networks although EC achieves the best performance WFCA still provides a comparatively good performance Note that the WFCA method can not only rank the nodes by considering the topological structure of a network but it can also rank nodes by considering the attributes of nodes 050see Fig 6h\051 From the tables and 034gures we observe that WFCA delivers a superior spreading effect compared with the other algorithms Furthermore we compare the in\035uence of the top-10 nodes that are discriminatively selected by WFCA and other algorithms All top-10 different nodes are used as seed nodes and the time step t is set ranging from 1 to 25 Table 6 further presents the propagation in\035uence of top-10 different nodes in the Aviation network We can observe that the number of accumulative infected nodes F 050 t 051 increases as the time step t increases and eventually obtains a steady value after several time points Since there are 10 seed nodes the propagation of most networks reaches a steady state at the time step t D 15 and we can clearly investigate the spread effect of WFCA and other algorithms In addition Fig 7 illustrates the in\035uences of the different top-10 nodes in eight networks Note that the differences between two approaches can be distinguished effectively by investigating the effects of discriminative nodes of the two ranking lists Fig 7 shows that the WFCA method has a good spreading ef\034ciency of top-10 different nodes Speci\034cally WFCA has the best performance on the networks of Aviation Protein Powergrid Euroroad and Ca-Astroph In Friendships and DBLP networks EC and HITS have the best propagation effect and WFCA also has better spreading in\035uence than other algorithms V CONCLUSION In this paper we have considered the problem of detecting in\035uential nodes based on weighted formal concept analysis This method considers global information regarding a given network and converts binary relationships between nodes in the network into a hierarchy Then nodes are aggregated according to their attributes to rank node importance To evaluate the ef\034ciency of WFCA we conducted experiments on eight real networks and compared WFCA with several representative in\035uential node detection algorithms VOLUME 5 2017 3787

R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  TABLE 4 Features that describes student and system interaction P2AI Component The core of the P2AI component relies on the H2O DLANNs algorithm which is based on a multi-layer feed forward ANNs that are trained using back-propagation 050BP\051 with stochastic-gradient descent We divided dataset into two parts 60 for training and 40 for testing We performed 400 iterations with two hidden layers each containing 800 neurons For testing the P2AI Component we have used a real dataset av ailable online by edX published in 2014 The major feature of this data is that it describes de gree of interaction between the student and edX The edX online education entity is a massive open online course 050MOOC\051 provider founded in year 2012 by the collaborative efforts of Harvard and MIT It offers high quality online courses that are delivered and designed by some of the best minds around the world The edX data that we used contained a large number of missing values We therefore discarded rows which had more than four missing columns i.e the columns which were related to our analysis containing students eventbased records describing student and system interaction 050Data Cleansing Fig 17\051 Further we imputed missing values using MICE Subsequently  we selected a sub set of attrib utes which are most relevant by using RF generated feature importance A subset of these selected features only those that describe student and system interaction are listed in Table 4 Using the selected features data we performed predictions based on the certi\034ed attribute 050not mentioned in the table\051 with class label of 1 for certi\034ed 050successful\051 students and 0 for unsuccessful students B RESULTS The results related to the student performance obtained through the P2AI Component prototype are depicted in Fig 19 The 034gure plots the number of times the student population interacted with the edX The student population is separated into two groups the students who gained upto 50 marks 050depicted by the yellow color bars\051 and those who gained between 51 to 100 marks 050depicted by the blue color bars\051 The average number of times the student population interacted with edX are plotted in four different categories Average videos played average chapters read average activities and average events 050see Fig 19 A clear message FIGURE 19 Students scores against different type and number of inte-ractions with UTiLearn FIGURE 20 The classification error plot of the P2AI algorithm from the 034gure is that the students who received higher marks 050blue bars\051 interacted with the system signi\034cantly higher number of times 0503239 vs 1051\051 than those who received lower marks 050yellow bars\051 We could evidently imply that a student's marks are directly proportional to the number of times the student interacts 050uses the course content\051 with the system Fig 20 The classi\034cation error plot of the P2AI algorithm Fig 20 depicts the accuracy of the DLANN prediction algorithm 050see Fig 18\051 in terms of the classi\034cation error It shows a very small error 050the y-axis scale is very small\051 The algorithm achieved a 99.83 classi\034cation accuracy a 0.0018 mean square error 050MSE\051 and a 0.0427 root mean square error 050RMSE\051 These are relatively high accuracies achieved by the use of DLANNs algorithm though as mentioned earlier it incurs high computational costs 050see IX DISCUSSION CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK The education industry around the globe is undergoing major transformations MOOC organisations such as Coursera Khan Academy are advancing new business models for education Several major industries have dropped university degrees from the requirements for job applicants Industry is increasingly focusing on nurturing speci\034c skills in the workforce as opposed to or in addition to a university degree The economics of higher education institutions VOLUME 5 2017 2631 
 


R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  are under threat in a continuing gloomy global economy while digital and lifelong learners are increasingly demanding new T&L paradigms There is a clear and urgent need to transform teaching and learning landscape in order to drive global economic growth The use of distance eTeaching and eLearning 050DTL\051 is on the rise among digital natives alongside our evolution towards smart societies However the DTL systems today lack the necessary sophistication due to several challenges including data analysis and management learner-system interactivity system cognition resource planning agility and scalability We also discussed the developments around future cities and smart societies and highlighted the fundamental need of developing knowledge and human and social capital for their enablement It was discussed that smart society developments would extend the role of learning from mainstream education for employment scope to the notion of social and collaborative governance where the society will collaborate to train each other in maintaining its knowledge moral 034ber good practice resilience competitiveness and for bringing innovation and becoming a knowledge-based economy The key to such efforts would be a converged ubiquitous infrastructure comprising many systems that share information among them and collaborate with each other as necessary We felt motivated by the challenges and opportunities surrounding the education industry and digital learners as well as the developments in urbanisation and proposed in this paper a Ubiquitous eTeaching  eLearning 050UTiLearn\051 Framework UTiLearn leveraged IoT big data supercomputing deep learning mobile computing and cloud computing to provide enhanced development management and delivery of teaching and learning in future city and smart society settings UTiLearn framework provides an environment and ecosystem for societies to enrich their knowledge anytime anywhere any age through improved processes for collection development accessibility pedagogy and cognition of knowledge Its users could be teachers students governments 050such as for cloud-based healthcare systems 101]\051 b usinesses third parties and virtual organisations or groups formed for speci\034c purposes A learner may register her preferences and the system advises her through to the completion of the learning task In addition to the usual functions of an MOOC a government department can develop speci\034c material to reach out to a group of people to create awareness of a topic for social intervention purposes The UTiLearn framework can run in a cloud and can be offered as a service UTLaaS A proof of concept implementation of the UTiLearn framework called the UTiLearn system comprising 034ve components was developed in the paper The 034ve components were described in details along with their functions methodologies algorithms implementation as well as their evaluation We used 11 widely used datasets for system evaluation The R statistical platform was used for the data analysis data quality management prediction and decision making The methods used included Na\357ve Bayes classi\034er Random Forest and DLANNs The experiments were carried out on the supercomputer Aziz Future work will focus on building additional capacity of the UTiLearn system in terms of the quality and functionality of the processes used in the various components of the system data quality management extension of big data related functionalities and IoT related functionalities A major issue in designing a real life UTiLearn system would be its data and information management We could bene\034t by the research and practice on designing sustainable enterprise information systems Our earlier work in this respect 103 would form the basis of our future direction on extending information management aspects of the UTiLearn system Another major issue in a scalable design of the UTiLearn system would be to deal with big data and computational load related issues Our research direction in this respect will rely on modelling analysis and design methods that leverage HPC technologies and are able to deal with big data such as our earlier work in and 10 5 The w ork on the UARI component in this paper has revealed that the human activity datasets available online are limited in their quality and extent We believe that in the future many more detailed and high quality datasets will be available to allow a better understanding of human activities across space and time Moreover systems like UTiLearn can record the activity data of the users and buildup its own datasets over time to have a better understanding of human activities to allow better optimisation of pedagogy human cognition delivery mode selections and required application traf\034c and network characteristics Additional work is also needed in 034nding and incorporating networking applications and system workload related datasets to be used in the SNPDP Component These are required to enhance the precision of the training computation and prediction of networking characteristics application traf\034c models and system models In this respect our earlier work on city transportation modelling evacuation and telematics such as in  w ould be useful both from activity recognition and learning point of view That is information learning and entertainment would be integrated and system optimization would bene\034t from all kinds of 050big\051 data Finally the use of computational and arti\034cial intelligence and human-machine interaction demands a careful look at the design of UTiLearn and similar systems There is need to consider the theory and practice of sociotechnical systems  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The experiments reported in this paper were performed on the Aziz supercomputer at KAU The authors
