R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  TABLE 4 Features that describes student and system interaction P2AI Component The core of the P2AI component relies on the H2O DLANNs algorithm which is based on a multi-layer feed forward ANNs that are trained using back-propagation 050BP\051 with stochastic-gradient descent We divided dataset into two parts 60 for training and 40 for testing We performed 400 iterations with two hidden layers each containing 800 neurons For testing the P2AI Component we have used a real dataset av ailable online by edX published in 2014 The major feature of this data is that it describes de gree of interaction between the student and edX The edX online education entity is a massive open online course 050MOOC\051 provider founded in year 2012 by the collaborative efforts of Harvard and MIT It offers high quality online courses that are delivered and designed by some of the best minds around the world The edX data that we used contained a large number of missing values We therefore discarded rows which had more than four missing columns i.e the columns which were related to our analysis containing students eventbased records describing student and system interaction 050Data Cleansing Fig 17\051 Further we imputed missing values using MICE Subsequently  we selected a sub set of attrib utes which are most relevant by using RF generated feature importance A subset of these selected features only those that describe student and system interaction are listed in Table 4 Using the selected features data we performed predictions based on the certi\034ed attribute 050not mentioned in the table\051 with class label of 1 for certi\034ed 050successful\051 students and 0 for unsuccessful students B RESULTS The results related to the student performance obtained through the P2AI Component prototype are depicted in Fig 19 The 034gure plots the number of times the student population interacted with the edX The student population is separated into two groups the students who gained upto 50 marks 050depicted by the yellow color bars\051 and those who gained between 51 to 100 marks 050depicted by the blue color bars\051 The average number of times the student population interacted with edX are plotted in four different categories Average videos played average chapters read average activities and average events 050see Fig 19 A clear message FIGURE 19 Students scores against different type and number of inte-ractions with UTiLearn FIGURE 20 The classification error plot of the P2AI algorithm from the 034gure is that the students who received higher marks 050blue bars\051 interacted with the system signi\034cantly higher number of times 0503239 vs 1051\051 than those who received lower marks 050yellow bars\051 We could evidently imply that a student's marks are directly proportional to the number of times the student interacts 050uses the course content\051 with the system Fig 20 The classi\034cation error plot of the P2AI algorithm Fig 20 depicts the accuracy of the DLANN prediction algorithm 050see Fig 18\051 in terms of the classi\034cation error It shows a very small error 050the y-axis scale is very small\051 The algorithm achieved a 99.83 classi\034cation accuracy a 0.0018 mean square error 050MSE\051 and a 0.0427 root mean square error 050RMSE\051 These are relatively high accuracies achieved by the use of DLANNs algorithm though as mentioned earlier it incurs high computational costs 050see IX DISCUSSION CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK The education industry around the globe is undergoing major transformations MOOC organisations such as Coursera Khan Academy are advancing new business models for education Several major industries have dropped university degrees from the requirements for job applicants Industry is increasingly focusing on nurturing speci\034c skills in the workforce as opposed to or in addition to a university degree The economics of higher education institutions VOLUME 5 2017 2631 
 


R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  are under threat in a continuing gloomy global economy while digital and lifelong learners are increasingly demanding new T&L paradigms There is a clear and urgent need to transform teaching and learning landscape in order to drive global economic growth The use of distance eTeaching and eLearning 050DTL\051 is on the rise among digital natives alongside our evolution towards smart societies However the DTL systems today lack the necessary sophistication due to several challenges including data analysis and management learner-system interactivity system cognition resource planning agility and scalability We also discussed the developments around future cities and smart societies and highlighted the fundamental need of developing knowledge and human and social capital for their enablement It was discussed that smart society developments would extend the role of learning from mainstream education for employment scope to the notion of social and collaborative governance where the society will collaborate to train each other in maintaining its knowledge moral 034ber good practice resilience competitiveness and for bringing innovation and becoming a knowledge-based economy The key to such efforts would be a converged ubiquitous infrastructure comprising many systems that share information among them and collaborate with each other as necessary We felt motivated by the challenges and opportunities surrounding the education industry and digital learners as well as the developments in urbanisation and proposed in this paper a Ubiquitous eTeaching  eLearning 050UTiLearn\051 Framework UTiLearn leveraged IoT big data supercomputing deep learning mobile computing and cloud computing to provide enhanced development management and delivery of teaching and learning in future city and smart society settings UTiLearn framework provides an environment and ecosystem for societies to enrich their knowledge anytime anywhere any age through improved processes for collection development accessibility pedagogy and cognition of knowledge Its users could be teachers students governments 050such as for cloud-based healthcare systems 101]\051 b usinesses third parties and virtual organisations or groups formed for speci\034c purposes A learner may register her preferences and the system advises her through to the completion of the learning task In addition to the usual functions of an MOOC a government department can develop speci\034c material to reach out to a group of people to create awareness of a topic for social intervention purposes The UTiLearn framework can run in a cloud and can be offered as a service UTLaaS A proof of concept implementation of the UTiLearn framework called the UTiLearn system comprising 034ve components was developed in the paper The 034ve components were described in details along with their functions methodologies algorithms implementation as well as their evaluation We used 11 widely used datasets for system evaluation The R statistical platform was used for the data analysis data quality management prediction and decision making The methods used included Na\357ve Bayes classi\034er Random Forest and DLANNs The experiments were carried out on the supercomputer Aziz Future work will focus on building additional capacity of the UTiLearn system in terms of the quality and functionality of the processes used in the various components of the system data quality management extension of big data related functionalities and IoT related functionalities A major issue in designing a real life UTiLearn system would be its data and information management We could bene\034t by the research and practice on designing sustainable enterprise information systems Our earlier work in this respect 103 would form the basis of our future direction on extending information management aspects of the UTiLearn system Another major issue in a scalable design of the UTiLearn system would be to deal with big data and computational load related issues Our research direction in this respect will rely on modelling analysis and design methods that leverage HPC technologies and are able to deal with big data such as our earlier work in and 10 5 The w ork on the UARI component in this paper has revealed that the human activity datasets available online are limited in their quality and extent We believe that in the future many more detailed and high quality datasets will be available to allow a better understanding of human activities across space and time Moreover systems like UTiLearn can record the activity data of the users and buildup its own datasets over time to have a better understanding of human activities to allow better optimisation of pedagogy human cognition delivery mode selections and required application traf\034c and network characteristics Additional work is also needed in 034nding and incorporating networking applications and system workload related datasets to be used in the SNPDP Component These are required to enhance the precision of the training computation and prediction of networking characteristics application traf\034c models and system models In this respect our earlier work on city transportation modelling evacuation and telematics such as in  w ould be useful both from activity recognition and learning point of view That is information learning and entertainment would be integrated and system optimization would bene\034t from all kinds of 050big\051 data Finally the use of computational and arti\034cial intelligence and human-machine interaction demands a careful look at the design of UTiLearn and similar systems There is need to consider the theory and practice of sociotechnical systems  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The experiments reported in this paper were performed on the Aziz supercomputer at KAU The authors
