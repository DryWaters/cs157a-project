Z Sun et al  Identifying Influential Nodes in Complex Networks Based on WFCA  FIGURE 1 Toy example of WFCA 050a\051 A toy network G  050b\051 The formal context of the network G  050c\051 The concept lattices of the network G  WFCA clusters objects by attributes For example the concept C 4 clusters concepts C 7  C 8  C 10  and C 11  which have the common attribute f 3 g  The objects 1  2  4  5 are gathered to the concept C 4  Therefore the more objects that are aggregated the more important the corresponding attribute becomes in\035uential nodes in complex networks have been the subject of increasing attention So far many methods for identifying in\035uential nodes have been proposed such as degree centrality closeness centrality 19 betweennesscentrality P ageRank 21 Leader Rank 22 H-index and HITS 24 Although man y algorithms have been proposed these methods all have their own advantages and limitations For example degree centrality has a comparatively low time complexity but has a low accuracy The PageRank algorithm is stable in scale-free networks but it is sensitive to disturbances of random networks Leader Rank performs well in directed complex networks but cannot be applied in undirected complex networks In this paper we propose a new method called WFCA to identify in\035uential nodes in complex networks We consider the problem of detecting in\035uential nodes from the new viewpoint of weighted formal concept analysis This takes into account the relationships of nodes in terms of the overall structure of the network and converts binary relationships into a hierarchy structure We will describe WFCA in Section 3 but 034rst let us elaborate on the basic idea A BASIC IDEAS Formal concept analysis 050FCA\051 pro vides a po werful approach to data mining and knowledge representation The concept of FCA consists of objects and attributes FCA uses binary object-attribute relations to construct a knowledge hierarchy that re\035ects the intrinsic relationships between objects and attributes Here we consider a given complex network as a formal context Nodes of the complex network represent the objects and attributes of the formal context An edge between nodes denotes a binary relation where an attribute belongs to an object When building upon the concepts of FCA the calculation of important nodes is involved in three major steps First we construct the adjacency matrix of a network as the formal context Subsequently we compute the concepts of the formal context Finally we calculate the weight of each node based on the concepts To further illustrate the basic idea let us consider a toy network as an example Here Fig 1\050a\051 illustrates a network G that contains 034ve nodes and six edges Fig 1\050b\051 presents the formal context of the network G  and Fig 1\050c\051 shows the concept lattices of the formal context The method of calculating the concept lattice will be described in Section 3.2 In Fig 1\050c\051 there are 12 concepts denoted by C 1 to C 12  The numbers 0501  2  3  4  5\051 represent objects and 0501  2  3  4  5#\051 denote attributes Both of these represent the nodes 0501  2  3  4  5\051 Formal concept analysis aggregates these objects by attributes to form a hierarchy where C 12 is located in the bottom C 7 000 C 11 are located in the 034rst layer C 2 000 C 6 are located in the second layer and C 1 is located in the top layer As the level increases more objects are added while the attributes gradually reduce The hierarchy structure not only re\035ects the intrinsic links between nodes but also characterizes the generalization-instantiation relationships between concepts For example because the concepts C 7  C 8  C 10  and C 11 have the common attribute f 3 g  objects with this attribute will be gathered to form the concept C 4  In Fig 1\050c\051 we can observe that the more objects are aggregated the more important the corresponding attribute becomes The weights of the attributes in each concept are obtained intuitively by using the number of objects divided by the number of attributes B CONTRIBUTIONS WFCA has several attractive bene\034ts for identifying in\035uential nodes in complex networks most importantly 017 A new viewpoint  We consider the problem of detecting in\035uential nodes from a new viewpoint weighted formal concept analysis  This takes into account global information regarding the network and converts binary relationships between nodes in a network into a hierarchy This hierarchy not only re\035ects the intrinsic links between nodes but also characterizes the generalizationinstantiation relationships between concepts of nodes This allows the clustering of object nodes based on identical attributes nodes Therefore the more objects that are aggregated the more important the corresponding attribute becomes 050see Fig 1\050c\051\051 017 High performance  Compared with several representatives of in\035uential node detection algorithms the WFCA 3778 VOLUME 5 2017

in undirected or directed networks but is also applicable to attributed networks The remainder of this paper is organized as follows In the next section we provide a brief overview of related work Section 3 describes the main idea of WFCA and then presents the algorithm in detail Section 4 compares WFCA with several representative methods on eight real-world networks Finally our conclusions are presented in Section 5 II RELATED WORK In recent years many approaches have been proposed for identifying in\035uential nodes 050e.g degree centrality K-shell closeness centrality 19 betweenness centrality eigen v ector centrality 27 P ageRank 21 Leader Rank H-inde x 23 and HITS 24]\051 Here we only provide a brief survey regarding the identi\034cation of in\035uential nodes A STRUCTURE-BASED APPROACHES The in\035uence of a node is signi\034cantly affected by the network topology In fact the majority of approaches for identifying in\035uential nodes only consider structural information Existing Structure-based measures can be divided into two categories one is based on the neighborhood of each node 050such as the degree centrality K-shell and H-index methods\051 while the other is based on paths between nodes 050such as closeness centrality and betweenness centrality\051 Degree centrality characterizes nodes with larger numbers of neighbors as having a larger in\035uence Thus it is the most simple index for characterizing in\035uential nodes However although it is simple and easy to calculate it suffers from poor accuracy owing to the lack of consideration of the global network structure K-shell determines the importance of a node according to its location in the network Although it has a low time complexity it is not suitable for some speci\034c types of networks such as rule or BA networks and the sorting also results in coarse-graining In contrast closeness centrality and betweenness centrality both have high computational complexity and so they are not suitable for application to large-scale networks B EIGENVECTOR-BASED APPROACHES Methods of this type not only consider the number of neighboring nodes but also take into account their in\035uences 050such as eigenvector centrality PageRank Leader Rank and HITS\051 Eigenvector centrality can be ef\034ciently calculated using a power iteration approach but it may become trapped in a zero status because of the presence of many nodes without in-degree P ageRank is a f amous ranking algorithm that is used in the Google search engine and it is a variant of the eigenvector centrality method It supposes that the importance of a web page is determined by both the quantity TABLE 1 Example of a formal context and the quality of the pages linked to it PageRank performs well in scale-free networks and has been widely employed in many 034elds However it is sensitive to disturbances of random networks and it exhibits topic drifts in special network structures The HITS algorithm considers each node in the network as performing two roles authority and hub Similarly HITS also exhibits a topic drift phenomenon Leader Rank performs well in directed complex networks but cannot be applied in undirected complex networks In general each algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages Effectively and ef\034ciently identifying in\035uential nodes remains a non-trivial task Here we provide an effective method for identifying in\035uential nodes which can not only be applied to directed or undirected networks but is also suitable for attributed networks III IDENTIFICATION OF INFLUENTIAL NODES BASED ON WFCA A PRELIMINARIES In this section we 034rst introduce some basic concepts and de\034nitions concerning FCA FCA is a powerful data analysis technique and was 034rst proposed by Rudolf Wille in 1982 In the past se v eral decades FCA has been widely applied in software engineering te xt processing  data mining 32 ontology engineering 33 and other 034elds 35 FCA considers entities that consist of objects and attributes where objects have attributes and attributes belong to objects The following are some de\034nitions relating to FCA De\034nition 1 A formal context is a triplet of sets K VD 050 O  A  I 051 where O is a set of objects A is a set of attributes and I 022 O 002 A is a binary relation between O and A  The object o is an element of the object set O  the attribute a is an element of the attribute set A  and oIa or 050 o  a 051 2 I indicates that the object o has the attribute a  Table 1 presents a formal context It can be represented as a two-dimensional table 050or matrix\051 where the rows represent objects and the columns are attributes The cross cell of a row and column in the table represents the incidence relation I  and all relations between objects and attributes could be written in a table In Table 1 the symbol 002 indicates that an object has the corresponding attribute For example object 2 has attributes 050a,b,c,d,f\051 De\034nition 2 For a

ranking lists The higher 034 value is the more accurate the ranking list the method could generate C PERFORMANCE EVALUATION In this experiment to better distinguish the importance of nodes we use relatively small values of 025 in SIR model namely 025 2 0  01  0   Because with a lar ge 025  the spreading would cover almost all the network Fig 5 sho ws Kendall's 034 of the WFCA method where the ranking lists are generated by the PR HITS EC K-shell H-index CC and BC As shown in Fig 5c the Kendall's 034 for the WFCA is between 0.8 and 0.9 for 025 2 0  01  0   indicating that the ranking lists generated by the WFCA and the real SIR spreading process are basically identical to each other From Fig 5 we can see that there are different performances for the different algorithms and the WFCA method performs well on different types of networks For instance for directed networks 050Aviation Protein and Blogs\051 and undirect networks 050Powergrid Euroroad and Ca-AstroPh\051 WFCA performs the best For the Friendships network EC and HITS have the best performance and the WFCA also has a better effect than the others In DBLP networks the EC algorithm achieves the best performance the WFCA method still provides a comparatively good performance and performs better than other algorithms Note that the performances of K-shell BC and CC are not good in Aviation Protein Blogs and Powergrid networks Because the K-shell algorithm is coarse-grained on the network division and the nodes of each layer are seen as equally important but in fact they are not Therefore for the network with small number of layers the effect is relatively poor On the contrary for multiple layers network the effect is better For the BC method there are many nodes whose values are the same because these nodes have the same number of shortest paths through them And the cc algorithm also has the same problem The performance of H-index method is also not good in directed networks 050Aviation Protein and Blogs\051 As you can see WFCA performs well not only in undirected networks but also in directed networks To further compares the propagation performance of the algorithms we investigate the spreading in\035uences of ranked nodes in SIR model Without loss of generality we set the infection probability 025 D 0  1 recovery probability 026 D 1  45 and time step t D 500 First we compute the in\035uence of each node using the various algorithms and rank them in descending order Table 5 presents the top-L ranked nodes Owing to space limitations we only display the top10 nodes of two networks including one directed network Aviation and one undirected network Euroroad We can see that most nodes of top-10 of WFCA are presented in other algorithms so the WFCA method has better accuracy than other algorithms For further evaluation each ranked node is considered as the seed node 050with only one seed node for each run\051 Finally we calculate the number of infected nodes for each seed node by averaging over 1000 implementations Fig 6 illustrates the average numbers of infected nodes ranked by the eight different algorithms A good algorithm should result in a downward slope from left to right that is the number of infected nodes should decrease as L increases This is because the more important a node is the more infected nodes there are Thus this node ranks higher In the Aviation Protein Blogs Powergrid Euroroad and aCa-AstroPh networks WFCA performs the best among all eight algorithms For the Friendships and DBLP networks although EC achieves the best performance WFCA still provides a comparatively good performance Note that the WFCA method can not only rank the nodes by considering the topological structure of a network but it can also rank nodes by considering the attributes of nodes 050see Fig 6h\051 From the tables and 034gures we observe that WFCA delivers a superior spreading effect compared with the other algorithms Furthermore we compare the in\035uence of the top-10 nodes that are discriminatively selected by WFCA and other algorithms All top-10 different nodes are used as seed nodes and the time step t is set ranging from 1 to 25 Table 6 further presents the propagation in\035uence of top-10 different nodes in the Aviation network We can observe that the number of accumulative infected nodes F 050 t 051 increases as the time step t increases and eventually obtains a steady value after several time points Since there are 10 seed nodes the propagation of most networks reaches a steady state at the time step t D 15 and we can clearly investigate the spread effect of WFCA and other algorithms In addition Fig 7 illustrates the in\035uences of the different top-10 nodes in eight networks Note that the differences between two approaches can be distinguished effectively by investigating the effects of discriminative nodes of the two ranking lists Fig 7 shows that the WFCA method has a good spreading ef\034ciency of top-10 different nodes Speci\034cally WFCA has the best performance on the networks of Aviation Protein Powergrid Euroroad and Ca-Astroph In Friendships and DBLP networks EC and HITS have the best propagation effect and WFCA also has better spreading in\035uence than other algorithms V CONCLUSION In this paper we have considered the problem of detecting in\035uential nodes based on weighted formal concept analysis This method considers global information regarding a given network and converts binary relationships between nodes in the network into a hierarchy Then nodes are aggregated according to their attributes to rank node importance To evaluate the ef\034ciency of WFCA we conducted experiments on eight real networks and compared WFCA with several representative in\035uential node detection algorithms VOLUME 5 2017 3787

R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  TABLE 4 Features that describes student and system interaction P2AI Component The core of the P2AI component relies on the H2O DLANNs algorithm which is based on a multi-layer feed forward ANNs that are trained using back-propagation 050BP\051 with stochastic-gradient descent We divided dataset into two parts 60 for training and 40 for testing We performed 400 iterations with two hidden layers each containing 800 neurons For testing the P2AI Component we have used a real dataset av ailable online by edX published in 2014 The major feature of this data is that it describes de gree of interaction between the student and edX The edX online education entity is a massive open online course 050MOOC\051 provider founded in year 2012 by the collaborative efforts of Harvard and MIT It offers high quality online courses that are delivered and designed by some of the best minds around the world The edX data that we used contained a large number of missing values We therefore discarded rows which had more than four missing columns i.e the columns which were related to our analysis containing students eventbased records describing student and system interaction 050Data Cleansing Fig 17\051 Further we imputed missing values using MICE Subsequently  we selected a sub set of attrib utes which are most relevant by using RF generated feature importance A subset of these selected features only those that describe student and system interaction are listed in Table 4 Using the selected features data we performed predictions based on the certi\034ed attribute 050not mentioned in the table\051 with class label of 1 for certi\034ed 050successful\051 students and 0 for unsuccessful students B RESULTS The results related to the student performance obtained through the P2AI Component prototype are depicted in Fig 19 The 034gure plots the number of times the student population interacted with the edX The student population is separated into two groups the students who gained upto 50 marks 050depicted by the yellow color bars\051 and those who gained between 51 to 100 marks 050depicted by the blue color bars\051 The average number of times the student population interacted with edX are plotted in four different categories Average videos played average chapters read average activities and average events 050see Fig 19 A clear message FIGURE 19 Students scores against different type and number of inte-ractions with UTiLearn FIGURE 20 The classification error plot of the P2AI algorithm from the 034gure is that the students who received higher marks 050blue bars\051 interacted with the system signi\034cantly higher number of times 0503239 vs 1051\051 than those who received lower marks 050yellow bars\051 We could evidently imply that a student's marks are directly proportional to the number of times the student interacts 050uses the course content\051 with the system Fig 20 The classi\034cation error plot of the P2AI algorithm Fig 20 depicts the accuracy of the DLANN prediction algorithm 050see Fig 18\051 in terms of the classi\034cation error It shows a very small error 050the y-axis scale is very small\051 The algorithm achieved a 99.83 classi\034cation accuracy a 0.0018 mean square error 050MSE\051 and a 0.0427 root mean square error 050RMSE\051 These are relatively high accuracies achieved by the use of DLANNs algorithm though as mentioned earlier it incurs high computational costs 050see IX DISCUSSION CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK The education industry around the globe is undergoing major transformations MOOC organisations such as Coursera Khan Academy are advancing new business models for education Several major industries have dropped university degrees from the requirements for job applicants Industry is increasingly focusing on nurturing speci\034c skills in the workforce as opposed to or in addition to a university degree The economics of higher education institutions VOLUME 5 2017 2631 
 


R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  are under threat in a continuing gloomy global economy while digital and lifelong learners are increasingly demanding new T&L paradigms There is a clear and urgent need to transform teaching and learning landscape in order to drive global economic growth The use of distance eTeaching and eLearning 050DTL\051 is on the rise among digital natives alongside our evolution towards smart societies However the DTL systems today lack the necessary sophistication due to several challenges including data analysis and management learner-system interactivity system cognition resource planning agility and scalability We also discussed the developments around future cities and smart societies and highlighted the fundamental need of developing knowledge and human and social capital for their enablement It was discussed that smart society developments would extend the role of learning from mainstream education for employment scope to the notion of social and collaborative governance where the society will collaborate to train each other in maintaining its knowledge moral 034ber good practice resilience competitiveness and for bringing innovation and becoming a knowledge-based economy The key to such efforts would be a converged ubiquitous infrastructure comprising many systems that share information among them and collaborate with each other as necessary We felt motivated by the challenges and opportunities surrounding the education industry and digital learners as well as the developments in urbanisation and proposed in this paper a Ubiquitous eTeaching  eLearning 050UTiLearn\051 Framework UTiLearn leveraged IoT big data supercomputing deep learning mobile computing and cloud computing to provide enhanced development management and delivery of teaching and learning in future city and smart society settings UTiLearn framework provides an environment and ecosystem for societies to enrich their knowledge anytime anywhere any age through improved processes for collection development accessibility pedagogy and cognition of knowledge Its users could be teachers students governments 050such as for cloud-based healthcare systems 101]\051 b usinesses third parties and virtual organisations or groups formed for speci\034c purposes A learner may register her preferences and the system advises her through to the completion of the learning task In addition to the usual functions of an MOOC a government department can develop speci\034c material to reach out to a group of people to create awareness of a topic for social intervention purposes The UTiLearn framework can run in a cloud and can be offered as a service UTLaaS A proof of concept implementation of the UTiLearn framework called the UTiLearn system comprising 034ve components was developed in the paper The 034ve components were described in details along with their functions methodologies algorithms implementation as well as their evaluation We used 11 widely used datasets for system evaluation The R statistical platform was used for the data analysis data quality management prediction and decision making The methods used included Na\357ve Bayes classi\034er Random Forest and DLANNs The experiments were carried out on the supercomputer Aziz Future work will focus on building additional capacity of the UTiLearn system in terms of the quality and functionality of the processes used in the various components of the system data quality management extension of big data related functionalities and IoT related functionalities A major issue in designing a real life UTiLearn system would be its data and information management We could bene\034t by the research and practice on designing sustainable enterprise information systems Our earlier work in this respect 103 would form the basis of our future direction on extending information management aspects of the UTiLearn system Another major issue in a scalable design of the UTiLearn system would be to deal with big data and computational load related issues Our research direction in this respect will rely on modelling analysis and design methods that leverage HPC technologies and are able to deal with big data such as our earlier work in and 10 5 The w ork on the UARI component in this paper has revealed that the human activity datasets available online are limited in their quality and extent We believe that in the future many more detailed and high quality datasets will be available to allow a better understanding of human activities across space and time Moreover systems like UTiLearn can record the activity data of the users and buildup its own datasets over time to have a better understanding of human activities to allow better optimisation of pedagogy human cognition delivery mode selections and required application traf\034c and network characteristics Additional work is also needed in 034nding and incorporating networking applications and system workload related datasets to be used in the SNPDP Component These are required to enhance the precision of the training computation and prediction of networking characteristics application traf\034c models and system models In this respect our earlier work on city transportation modelling evacuation and telematics such as in  w ould be useful both from activity recognition and learning point of view That is information learning and entertainment would be integrated and system optimization would bene\034t from all kinds of 050big\051 data Finally the use of computational and arti\034cial intelligence and human-machine interaction demands a careful look at the design of UTiLearn and similar systems There is need to consider the theory and practice of sociotechnical systems  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The experiments reported in this paper were performed on the Aziz supercomputer at KAU The authors
