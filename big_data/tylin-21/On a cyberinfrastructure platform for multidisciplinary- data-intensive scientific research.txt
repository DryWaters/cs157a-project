Although constrained by financial and human resources available, this cyberinfrastructure, named as Southern Nevada Research Cloud \(SNRC an advanced, sustainable endto-end data acquisition and proce ssing system that encompasses remote data sensors and research sites, high speed computer networks, and big data processing capabilities. Built upon the integration and fine-tuning of off-the-shelf hardware and many open source software packages, SNRC is currently being tested by the researchers and other stakeholders in support of their research and educational missions  Keywords\227 cyberinfrastructure cloud computing; big data MapReduce I B ACKGROUND Scie ntific research has seen a fundamental paradigm shift from being model-driven to data-driven  Sensi n g  st or i ng processing, managing, analyzing and explaining massive amount of data has become an important way to know the status and behaviors of an observed system In a si m p l e  term, big data is reshaping and redesigning the world of science This vision also inspired this team to help develop an enabling cyberinfrastructure \(CI\y to support a large scale, state-wide project, now known as Nevada Nexus  Funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation \(NSF\ for a total length of five years \(2013-2018\Nevada Nexus project is geared to engage a slew of res earchers and graduate students as well as other stakeholders in conducting multidisciplinary scientific research and related activities in the synergetic areas of solar energy, water, and environment. Key to the success of this ambitious Nexus endeavor is to provide a suitable cyberinfrastructure to facilitate advanced data services, realtime data streaming and visualization, data mining and analysis, image processing, da ta security and cloud-based computing Prior to 2013 through a separate NSF-funded project, a data portal, then called Nevada Climate Change Portal \(NCCP  was completed by a sister institute as a centralized data reservoir to store all kinds of scientific data collected from several sensor towers across the state of Nevada. The facilities and tools of NCCP were inherited by the Nexus and was officially renamed to become th e Nevada Research Data Center NRDC  as an i n t e gra l part of t h e current  Ne xus cyberinfrastructure. Besides the work to expand the capability of NRDC, more efforts have been devoted to erect more sensor towers. Up to date, 13 of these sensor towers have been up sending GB of geospatial a nd image data \(atmosphere precipitation, soil, and vegetation\ the NRDC every day, and more sensor towers are expected to join the data collection network as the Nexus project continues to move forward Considering the massive amount of data that are available to the Nexus researchers, it becomes imperative to build a fully functional CI that must provide four major functionalities: \(i data storage \(mostly supported by NRDC\ \(ii\a processing iii d ata visualization, and \(iv\nnectivity with other nationa l o r even international data or service provid ers.  Such a CI facility named as the Southern Nevada Research Cloud SN RC\us presented in this paper Fig 1 A High Level Conceptual Framework of SNRC in Support of Scientific Research in Solar, Water, and Environment  II O VERVIEW OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY S NRC Co n sidering that the end data consumers in Nexus project are researchers from different scie ntific domains and they have varying needs and skill levels in information technology, the Southern Nevada Research Cloud \(SNRC\as been developed with the following criteria in mind 
200 Big data support 200 Scalability and flexibility 200 QoS guaranteed performance among shared users 200 User-centric and expressive interface 200 Mu ltidisciplinary research support 200 Multi programming paradigm support 200 Manageability The conceptual framework of th e SNRC is shown in Fig. 1 To decouple the interaction between the services thus making development process manageable, services are broadly divided 
 


into five groups with the scope and functionality of each service group defined below 1  Infrastructural Service comprises operating system management tools, virtualization, and security service 2  Networking Service provides robust connectivity among instances 3  Storage Service provides the services to meet the data storage needs irrespective of the origin of the data source   4  Connectivity Service provides the connectivity between SNRC and the NRDC \(geospatial data and image data\ween SNRC and other databases hosting public and/or private data sets 5  Processing and Visualization Services provide user interface to access the computing resources and services, delegating storage and processing calls into underlay services In what follows, Section III describes the hardware platform, followed by the detailed descriptions of various services supported by the SNRC. Section IV presents the implementation of the infrastructural service such as the operating system, management and a few other services Section V is dedicated to the ne twork architecture. Sections VI and VII address the design and implementation issues of storage and processing subsystem, respectively. Results of performance study are reported in Section VIII, and finally, the paper is summarized in Section IX III  H ARDWARE B UILDUP  All the hardware components needed by the SNRC are acquired by evaluating various applicable factors, tradeoffs and scenarios, including the cost, turn-around time, reputation of the vendors, estimation and prediction of current and future data volumes, number of users to be supported, and availability of technical support from the vendors A simple model has been adopted to help identify the baseline hardware configuration, which is explained bellow 1  To maximize the processing performance, each I/O thread should be matched with an associated processing thread, on each computing node num of processing threads num of I/O threads num of hard drives NN N    num of cores num of processing threads NN   2  Each computing node must have sufficient memory space as needed for parallel data processing total RAM size num of cores thread RAM size MNM   3  To transfer data across co mputing nodes efficiently the ideal network throughput must be greater than the parallel I/O throughput network thoughput num of hard drives hard drive thoughput TN T    This model leads to the acquisition of the major hardware components that are tabulated in Table I. The acquired hardware components are mounte d on a server rack shown in Fig. 2. As little cost has incurred when loading the open source software to run on this hardware platform, the hardware cost is mostly what this team have paid to build SNRC besides human capitals. Note that the hardware resources can be easily added in when there is a need to scale up the performance T ABLE I  H ARDWARE S PECIFICATION     F IG   2  T HE S ERVER R ACK THAT H OUSES A LL THE H ARDWARE C OMPONENTS  IV  I NFRASTRUCTURAL S ERVICES  A  Operating System Traditional GNU/Linux distributio ns have some limitations in a cloud-computing context, as summarized below   Compatibility Most traditional Enterprise Linux distributions have three to five years’ release cycle based on certain Long-term support kernel and foundational tools and libraries \(e.g. C libraries\While new distribution is still under development, these outstanding distributions may have already become obsolete when a new data center project is launched making them incompatible with many tools which are desired or must be supported   Unnecessary bloat The one-fit-all design made these distributions unnecessarily la rge and adds bloat expands the testing matrix to certify a new release   Unoptimized Since all the binary distributions attempt to support as many platforms as possible, they usually target the most popular mi cro-architectures in the market. Thus, new instructions and other hardware resources are typically poorly supported, or even left out unsupported 
 


These limitations forced us to develop a new distribution to meet the needs of the SNRC. The new distribution is based on Gentoo Linux  a sou r ce-based r o l l i ng rel ease m e ta distribution which offers a large degree of flexibility for distribution customization and optimization. Our distribution was highly customized to include just the essentials and userland applications, while performance optimization is performed to reflect the speci fic process architecture and application environment that we are working with.  Security is enhanced with kernel hardening  T h e di st ri but i on has s een an average of 2% performance gain just by compiler flags tuning. Selection of faster libraries also draw huge impacts on application performance, e.g. up to 36X speedup on matrix operations has been achieved by choosing OpenBLAS [8 over netlib [9 However, deployment of the new distribution on physical computing nodes can cause some practical problems. First, it sets barriers to system administra tive stuff, requiring a higher skill set and deeper understanding of underlay operating system internals. Second, support of physical hardware requires more device drivers and administrative tools, which are often not useful in user application environment. Thus, Centos 7 is adopted as our base OS running on physical machines upon its public release, and the new distribution is repacked to include cloud image, running inside the virtual machines and containers B  Virtualization Virtualization helps improve the scalability, efficiency and availability of resources. Traditional virtualization tools, such as libvirt, do not scale very well. In our experimental study, it is discovered that when the number of virtual instances increases, the network performance drops dramatically. Totally 40 virtual instances have been setup by libvirt with KVM [1   wherein 2 out of the 40 nodes su ffered a packet lose rate as high as over 90% constantly. This problem can be solved by introducing Open vSwitch and OpenStack[1  whi c h i n t u rn  requires a total redesign of the entire network architecture as discussed in Section V C  Managment Management tools not only reduce human labors but also are a key to the success of this project. Various tools have been deployed to ease the configuration and management task throughout the development. In specific, hardware resources are managed under OpenStack and IPMI tools, while users are managed under LDAP Besides these existing tools, a number of scripts have been developed in-house to automate the management tasks. There is one script developed for OS installation and configuration and it hashes the MAC address into hostnames and internal IP address and generates KickStart files based on the customized templates.  TFTP and other services are configured to allow computing nodes to boot from Intel Preboot eXecution Environment \(PXE\ading the OS image from the head node through the network and then completing the installation V  N ETWORK A RCHITECTURE  The network services provide connectivity among the physical and virtual instances. Open vSwitch \(OVS   which supports standard manage ment interfaces and protocols and enables network automation through programmatic extension, is determined to be suitable for our network implementation To isolate traffic between da ta processing and cluster control/management services, networks are segmented into three different Virtual LANs \(VLANs\strated in Fig. 3    Figure 3.   The Network Architecture   Fig.  4. Network Tra ffic Flow \(North-South  Fig. 4 shows how traffic is routed from North to South traffic between a virtual instan ce and the external network Firewall and packet state track ing are handled by security groups, which can be configur ed in OpenStack. To send packets from a virtual instance to the external network \(the Internet in our case e instance tap interface forwards packets to the Linux bridge \(qbr fter which the packets pass through the OVS integration bridge \(br-int\rt \(qvb ports, a pair of virtual devices that act as a patch cable, pair the integration bridge and tunnel bridge. The tunnel bridge sends traffic to the controller node ove r a physical interface using the Generic Routing Encapsulation \(GRE\ [13 as our pay l oad protocols are compatible but payload addresses not. The controller next forwards packets from the tunnel bridge to the integration bridge. Since there might be multiple virtual networks, a namespace router is in cluded. This router forwards packets from the integration bridge to its gateway \(qg\, which is patched with the external bridge. The external bridge sends packets to the physical gateway which connects to the Internet 
 


VI  S TORAGE S ERVICE  A typical distributed storage system, like Red Hat Global File System \(GFS\cle Cluster File Sy stem \(OCFS segments and stores data into different blobs among hosts while leaving processing to the end users. A MapReduce  based system \(Google GFS and Hadoop\ is more feasible for our purpose as it seamlessly integrates storage and processing The MapReduce model involves applying a map operation to key/value pairs, then a reduce operation to all the values sharing the same key, and a merge operation to process the result. Hadoop i s a fram e wor k f o r r u n n i ng appl i cat i ons on  large clusters built from commodity hardware. It takes advantage of data locality  t o reduce t h e com m unicat i o n  cost in parallel processing. Hadoop implements the MapReduce paradigm and provides a distributed filesystem the Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS\However, when data are hosted on a single storage cluster and shared among users, access control and QoS can be a big issue that is addressed by setting up two storage clusters: The Virtual Storage Cluster \(VSC\nd the Phys ical Storage Cluster \(PSC VSC resides in virtual cluster managed by the OpenStack and can be accessed by users. With an essentially identical architecture as VCS, PSC can pr ovide similar functionalities but it mainly services to the persistent storage needs MapReduce jobs initiated by users will be dispatched to the intermediate cluster, while streaming sensor data will be stored in the persistent cluster Note that an order of magnitude of performance penalty will be paid if a wrong storage scheme is adopted, mandating the system to be fine-tuned to support I/O intensive applications.  In this study, to maximize the I/O throughput each physical hard drive is par titioned into two volumes: the cinder volume and the HDFS volume. As illustrated in Fig. 5 HDFS volumes are configured as a block storage device for persistent cluster using LVM, while cinder volumes are managed by the cinder \(the block storage service for OpenStack\nd both are expo sed to the virtual instances through iSCSI \(Internet Small Co mputer System Interface this context, virtual instances should be built \(with written scripts has been granted access only to the disk in its hosted node VII  P ROCESSING AND V ISUALIZATION  The multidisciplinar y research flavor in Nexus requires diverse tool and programming language support. For decades scientists have used imperative programming language such as C, C++ or Fortran to code and run their scientific models, after which they submit their programs to Portable Batch System PBS\arallelism is achieved by using multi-thread and message passing library. As programming paradigm shifts declarative programming languages, such as Matlab/Octave and R, have been more widely adopted. They offer comparable performance but demand much shorter development time On the other hand, accessing distributed storage service requires deeper understanding of MapReduce and even requires users to learn a both new and old language: Java. Resilient Distributed Datasets \(RDD\ [17 ab stract p a ralle l d a ta  structures allow users to explicitly persist intermediate results in memory, encapsulate implementation details from user, and offer a rich set of operators fo r data processing. Spark [1  based on the concept of RDD, is easier to program and performs better when all the data can fit into the memory; it also performs real-time proce ssing using the existing machinelearning libraries and other toolboxes The IPython Notebook \(now known as the Jupyter Notebook\ integrate multipl e computing kernels into one single computational environment, combining code execution rich text, plots and ri ch media in an interactive document. The notebooks servers, can be deployed in hypervisor-based VM or Linux Container \(such as docker\th near to native performance These processing framework an d tools \(and many others have been bundled and integrated into our cloud distribution Fig. 6 shows the organization of these components. Fig. 7 shows a typical data processing workflow        Fig. 5. Storage System Design 
 


From a remote device, user logs into the notebook system calling REST client to import data from a remote site into HDFS. The data are saved in HDFS and cached as RDD in memory using Spark; RDD can be processed in Octave, R, or Python using existing machine learning libraries or other packages and can be visualized on the notebook instantly    Fig.  6. Processing and Visualization Framework  Fig.  7. Processing workflow To facilitate user’s need to access data that reside in NRDC the major NEXUS data reservoir introduced in Section I\ we have developed the connectivity service based on the Representational State Transfer REST\odel. The service is provided as a set of APIs for data query, transfer and synchronization. These APIs are tabulated in Table II VIII  PERFORMANCE  STUDY With respect to the diversity of the real-world scientific computational needs, the SNRC is examined in terms of network performance and distributed parallel data processing performance A  Network Performance Our goal is to find the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks, and the network performance assessment is obtained by running three sets of experiments  T ABLE II  C ONNECTIVITY API   i  point-to-point \(1-1\mmunication, which typically stipulates the peak perf ormance of the network ii  one-to-many \(1-N\mun ication, which captures typical broadcast-alike traffic often found in distributed parallel processing iii  many concurrent point-to-point \(N-N communications To avoid inference from other applications, we choose the idle nodes with the SNRC cluster to conduct our experiments In our experiment, N is set to 10. Both TCP and UDP traffics are tested, with maximum Transm ission Units \(MTU\ set as 9000 bytes \(compared to default 1500\. The average bandwidth is calculated in 120-second period. In addition, for TCP traffic, the number of retries on all participated nodes is accumulated during test; for UDP traffic, the packets loss rate is calculated as the number of lost packets divided by total number of packets T ABLE III  N ETWORK P ERFORMANCE   TCP   Table III lists the TCP results. The peak bandwidth is achieved on point-to-point communication, with only 42 retries during 120-second period. The peak bandwidth \(9.89 Gbps\s very close to theoretical maxi mum bandwidth of the Ethernet controller. The bandwidth has a slight drop in concurrent pointto-point TCP connection, but with smaller retries number \(25.5 on each node. The one-to-man y TCP test is bounded by network interface and processor performance. wherein a total of 7.8 Gbps throughput \(based on the average bandwidth 0.78 on each stream The UDP results are listed in Table IV, from the table we can see UDP is generally slower than TCP in high bandwidth this was due to lack of congestion control and hardware of  oading. But in certain cases, i e., broadcast-alike traffics UDP is still favorable since it can achieve higher throughput During one-to-many UDP test, the source node achieves 9.9 Gbps \(based on the average ba ndwidth 0.99 on each stream which is 27% higher than that of TCP 
 


T ABLE IV  N ETWORK P ERFORMANCE   UDP  B  Processing Performance Study Since the primary fo cus of SNRC scienti  c big data processing, the Hi benchm ark sui t e  i s used t o test overall system performance in terms of speed \(i.e., job running time\hroughput, I/O bandwidth. HiBench consists of a set of workloads including both synthetic and real-world applications In our test, four workloads Database join, aggregation Bayesian classi  cation and K-means clustering\have been selected to cover typical appl ication scenarios in scienti  c data processing, three popular micro benchmarks are included, and two HDFS benchmarks \(DFS read and write\ for assessing HDFS syst em performance Tests have been performed on physical storage cluster among 10 data nodes, and results are tabulated in Table V for reference. The HDFS workload sh ow that throughput of HDFS can reach up to 294 MB/s on read, and 251 MB/s on write; In sort work load, the system can process 3.29GB data in about 35 seconds, given a total throughput of 92.68 MB/s. With better map-reduce based algorithms, the TeraSort can process 32GB data in only 116 seconds, boosting the throughput to 274.40 MB/s, which is close to DFS I/O throughput T ABLE V  D ISTRIBUTED P ROCESSING P ERFORAMNCE    IX  SUMMARY This paper presented various services and features provided by the SNRC, a platform specially developed to support a large research team engaging in multid isciplinary research efforts The architecture and many impl ementation details of the SNRC were provided. Currently SNRC can store and process tens of Tera Bytes dataset and support over 100 researchers conducting research on Nexus project. Its capability can be easily scaled up to process hundreds to thousands Tera Bytes of data and support thousands of users, with additional commodity hardware.

S Yang et al  Semantic Inference on Clinical Documents Combining Machine Learning Algorithms With an Inference Engine  TABLE 7 Comparison of different classifiers used in CDTS and determine the one whose symptoms are the closest to those of the new patient at this stage and its corresponding treatment strategy is hereby applied to the patient at this stage It is of note that the treatment phase numbers of the old and new medical records might not be the same in this case Afterward the treatment phase number for the new patient is adjusted to the historical medical record's next treatment phase number Repeat Rule1 until the patient fully recovers For example a dataset  will be established when the symptoms of a new patient in the third phase do not match the historical records at the same time point Then we go through all of the records again and if any two phases of one historical record share similar symptoms with the 034rst two phases of the new patient it will be kept in   Given that any historically successful treatment 021 has m treatment phases on average the comparison procedure will be conducted C 2 m D m\050m 000 1\051  2 times at most If there are n cases then the time complexity is O\050n 003 m 2 051 This method is used to capture extended similar historical cases After the establishment of   all of the phases of the cases in  are compared with the third phase of the new patient treatment on the symptoms to 034nd the most similar one with the maximum rank at the similarity measurement matrix   which determines the treatment strategy for the new patient at the third phase C RESULTS AND ANALYSIS To enlarge the training dataset we randomly resample the dataset 1000 times without replacement by using the 034lter Resample in Weka In Table 7 iOVFDT constructs the smallest tree model compared with the other three classi\034ers in terms of the nodes leaves and depth HT and HAT also perform well in the construction of a nice tree model with 97 and 116 nodes 50 and 58 leaves and 21 and 23 depths respectively HOT has the largest tree size with more nodes and leaves which implies training dataset over\034tting As shown in Figs 8 and 9 Hoeffding-based tree classi\034ers have better performance compared to iOVFDT in terms of the classi\034cation correctness 050i.e accuracy\051 and kappa statistic 050i.e stability\051 With continuous incoming instances the accuracy and stability of Hoeffding-based tree classi\034ers rise with some 035uctuation while the performance of iOVFDT is kept at a horizontal level Similar to HAT the voted ensemble FIGURE 8 Comparison of classification correctness FIGURE 9 Comparison of the Kappa statistic FIGURE 10 Comparison of the evaluation time of the CPU multi-classi\034cation algorithm 050VEMCA\051 also performs well in terms of accuracy and stability and outperforms HAT when the number of instances is larger than 340000 Figs 10 and 11 compare the evaluation time of the CPU and the memory cost of the 034ve classi\034cation algorithms iOVFDT shows the fastest speed and the smallest memory cost among the 034ve classi\034cation algorithms HT gives better performance than HAT and HOT with 6.93 seconds in CPU occupation and a 0.91-Mb memory cost VEMCA's evaluation time and memory are 20.73 seconds and 1.62 Mb respectively VOLUME 5 2017 3543 


S Yang et al  Semantic Inference on Clinical Documents Combining Machine Learning Algorithms With an Inference Engine  FIGURE 11 Comparison of the memory cost VIII CONCLUSIONS Modern techniques such as CDSS and HIS have substantially facilitated clinical diagnosis and treatment However some of the emergent problems remain to be considered The 034rst problem is challenging the traditional data analysis techniques due to rapidly increasing amounts of multidimensional clinical data The second is the dif\034culty of clinical information integration Clinical information from different contexts are heterogeneous in terms of structure and semantics For the bene\034t of patients and long-term clinical development it is very promising to integrate clinical information 050e.g outpatients medical records\051 from different clinicians or hospitals to assist in clinical decision-making The third problem is the call for personalized medicine and professional medical treatment because different doctors or hospitals are good at diagnosing and treating different diseases and the patients have the freedom to choose among them To solve the three problems above this paper proposes a clinical diagnosis and treatment system 050CDTS\051 that assists patients in choosing clinicians or hospitals according to their requirements 050e.g distance from home to hospital\051 The foundation for disease detection in CDTS consists of decision trees that are created by our voted ensemble multiclassi\034cation algorithm that enables decision-tree-based data stream mining Furthermore to integrate clinical documents and heterogeneous health information systems a new clinical tabular document model is proposed which represents clinical documents in tabular format and maintains consistent vocabulary terms and semantic relations among different contexts through the term chain and semantic relation chain Additionally a novel semantic inference algorithm is designed for disease detection and treatment suggestion based on the rules that are generated by decision trees and similarity computations among medical records The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows 342 A uni\034ed clinical tabular document model 050CTDM\051 implemented by a new clinical tabular document language 050DocLang XML based\051 facilitates the interoperability among different clinical decision support systems 050CDSS\051 342 A new voted ensemble multi-classi\034cation algorithm is proposed in terms of running multiple decision treebased classi\034cation algorithms simultaneously on the same data stream and voting for the best output The results are associated with statistical information on the accuracy of classi\034cation which provides proof of optimization 342 A novel clinical diagnosis and treatment system with a newly designed semantic inference algorithm supports clinicians in the decision making process as well as saving time and expense for the patients For future work it is necessary to expand DocLang to become a more comprehensive markup language by importing more semantic relation types for more complex clinical documents These studies are in progress and are expected to present valuable results later REFERENCES   M A Makary and M Daniel Medical error\026The third leading cause of death in the US BMJ  vol 353 p i2139 May 2016   D Kopec M H Kabir D
