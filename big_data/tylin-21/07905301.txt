shift from a traditional silo approach to an integrated approach in collection, dissemination and analysis of structured and unstructured information for overall information protection and digital crime investigation goals. Digital crimes have become a big problem due to large number of data access, insufficient threat analysis techniques and growing size of storage capacity for investigating agencies. Since threat detection projects involve processing of large volume of uncertain information and to reduce uncertainties in the detection process, the analyst has to evaluate a large volume of data collected from different sources and network threat related databases. Being a data intensive 
analysis and detection, for improved analysis and detection, there is a need for these data to be harmonized and integrated along with the visualization technique for displaying large amount of data at once by incorporating information from various sources and variety of threat detection criteria’s \(e.g., threat types attacker behavior and motive, effects of the threat on resources Data Fusion and Integrated visualization of data distribution bars and rules, visualization of behavior and comprehensive analysis, maps allow investigating agencies to analyze different rules and data at different level, with any kind of anomaly. The primary aim of this study deals with have a front end or upstream approach towards an effective dynamic data fusion 
DF\-based analysis and detection procedures along with visualization technique for network forensic investigation and threat analysis. Thus such procedures would be able to detect different network trends and patterns and integrate various intrusion datasets from different sources. As a practical approach, the model has been implemented in identification analysis and detection for IP Spoofing as an illustrative example The application in this study shows that this approach can increase the efficiency of forensic digital investigation by dynamic data integration and incorporation of existing intrusion detection system based information in the network threat 
investigation and analysis  Keywords Data Fusion, SOM, Network threats, Network Forensics, Cyber Crime, Digital Evidence I  I NTRODUCTION  Cyberspace is termed as a pool of systems that are interconnected at a large scale. Such systems are comparatively large, complex and distinct. These systems are deployed in and specifically designed to meet the needs of the organization. So each organization comprises of its unique process of accessibility and connectivity [2   The m a ssive use  o f  the  internet is due to its nomina l cost and the usage of users without any login details unintentionally leads to cyber-crimes at a higher rate in the IT world. Web services are vulnerable to two types of attacks, i.e. attack during data transmission and 
attack by an intruder which may take any form that may jeopardize activities at a web serv  4 14 23   T h e commonly occurring attacks in network security are: DoS Cyber stalking, SYN flooding, Spam, hacking, theft, et Intrusion identification, detection capability is an elusive goal 7    15 re q u i r e s a  co nc er t e d  e ffo rt t h at app l i e s d i ffe rent  techniques to deal with it effec tively.  Also, the quick analysis and response to detecting intrusio n is an essential feature but its performance is affected by the huge amount of data obtained from organizations In our research paper we have shown the methodology of data fusion along with visualization techniques to handle multiple sources of data in forensic investigation of intrusion identification and analysis. A Fusion based Digital 
Investigation tool proposed in our previous work 20 based on Joint Director Laboratories \(JDL   12  ha s  bee n  already developed  and experimented in the crime case studies   22  Our stud y  w e exp l or e the po ssi b i lity o f  exten d ing our  investigation model to handle voluminous data in intrusion identification, detection and analysis II  N ETWORK F ORENSICS I NVESTIGATION AND  ITS CHALLENGES  Network forensics is the science of busting cyber criminals [3   It makes use of evidences that are proved scientifically correct and then making use of such evidences for analysis experiments, derivations accusations etc. to support the judiciary councils in the court of Law. The objectives are

The process of detecting threats and analyze them is a timeconsuming activity because enormous data is generated from different sources and it is important that all data be centralized in order to produce a thick and accurate scenario of the case 


Another major issue in this area is how to rapidly collect and normalize digital evidence [11 f r om dif f e ren t s o u r ces t h at  include firewalls, routers and IDS. Feature selection and ranking plays a major role in network forensics, because the removal of unwanted features can improve the accuracy of identifying the trivial information and henceforth increasing the computational accuracy for detections. In cases where there are no useless features, concentrating on the most significant factors improves the performance of the detection process with respect to the accuracy of detection in various remarkable ways. The major challenges network forensics investigation faces are [7 15  1 6  1 9     finding, categorizing and arranging volume of data   Sustaining data based on discovery   Recovering files   Controlling  on-site investigations   Hiring expertise To meet these requirements there requires productive tools and techniques to detect and uphold against crimes.

The above said tool function as a supporting tool to existing comp uter forensic investigation tools and extend the capabilities for solving various computer frauds and cyber-crime case IV  E XPLORING D ATA F USION AND SOM  V ISUALIZATION FOR N ETWORK F ORENSIC I NVESTIGATION  A  C ASE STUDY A NALYSIS  The most targeted entities across the globe when it comes to network threats are the financial, government sectors and banking systems. So, banking system is studied as a case study that uses the computing technolo gy to perform the tasks related to the customer and organization. Cheque clearance, Money deposit & withdrawals, loan applications, ID updations are the day to day tasks that are performed in the bank. Since this information is of utmost confidentiality, the data must be centrally located with the provision of the updated secured technologies. In this regard, each bank structures its own system in order to make sure that the transactions are done systematically and also ensures that there exists no such malicious activity that can dissa tisfy the customer. Howsoever some intruders always intrude in trying to change the secured structure of the system. In this work, we explore the possibility of extending our investigatio n model to handle multiple sources of data in intrusion identification, detection and analysis with the application of Data Fusion [6  8   1 2 a nd Data Visualization [9    D a ta fusi o n is a  co nc ep t  o f  fusing or merging the data from different sources in order to produce accurate and high quality information [8   1 2  T h e  objective is data cleaning \(removing insignificant information data transformation \(where raw data is converted into useful information\ and to create data components \(where data is broken into smaller components for better analysis\ [1   Along with data fusion since digital crimes is becoming a big problem due to large number of data access and insufficient forensic investigation analysis techniques, SOM based visualization due to its potential of mapping high dimension data into low dimension is used for displaying large amounts of data at once [9 10[1  Dat a f u s i on i n t e g r at e d  w i t h  visualization of data distribution bars, rules, behavior comprehensive analysis, maps can allow forensic investigator to analyze different rules and data, with any kind of anomaly in them One of the reputed nationalized banking system data from its network management system has been collected for our study Since we don’t work on the binary information, we make use of Forensic Toolkit to sketch the seized hard disk drive. From this hard disk, the files are extracted and analyzed for data fusion. As we are dealing with network intrusion identification and analysis, our main focus is to prepare a dataset with attributes that characterize network traffic behavior.   FTK toolkit is used to [1 to c o lle ct all the files. The further investigation of network intrusion identification, analysis using Fusion based digital investigation tool is summarized as follows A  Data Collection & Preprocessing Data preprocessing is the process of analyzing raw data for data cleaning and reduction so that the output produced is of high quality. Data cleaning requires   The raw data collected from the source   Knowledge of o  Important data o  Unimportant data Here in our study the connection term implies to the data packets that have malicious. Using expert knowledge, some unique features   that shows the features differentiate attacks from the normal data packets. Such features are classified into two categories   Those data packets that are related to data portion   Those data packets that imply the connection details which is inherited from header section of the packet The other group of feature is further categorized as   Categorization of attributes of the current connection for example duration, type, protocol, flag, etc   Categorization of attributes of number of similar  connections based on the knowledge gained from history of past connections that can result into an aggregate of the no. of connections from the same host or belonging to the same service at a given time frame or within the frame of predefined number of past connections 


  Categorization of attributes based on the information about the content of connection packets which has a relevance to be treated as intrusion Analysis at this level takes into account the generalized categorization of attributes which would be enough to describe network traffic and filters out the required data for further processing B  Low-level fusion This process of fusion consists of data reduction and data transformation. The data that passed through the preprocessing are first aligned to a common format. This alignment facilitates the comparison and further processing of multiple data that originate from different sources. The alignment stage of the data originating from different types of network management system sources \(servers, routers firewalls\ requires the following information   Raw data   A common reference format to which the data should be aligned During the alignment, relevant features are extracted from the raw data to form an abstract description of the raw data. Data originating from different sources are likely to possess different kinds of features. A source that observes network traffic [3  4  in gener a l k n o w s little m o r e ab o u t t h e ho st t h an  its network address   If t h e obs erv e d h o s t i s th e t a r g et  of an attack, the data originating from this source may include for instance detailed information about the application or process that was targeted by the observed event. The reference format is designed in such a way that it will provide enough room for these different kinds of features to be represented Different observations of data by the sources can refer to one and the same event. If multiple data pass through data preprocessing, this results eventually in multiple \(aligned\ data referring to a single event, thus being a single event. If source address, destination address, an d URL address of the two data are the same and the timestamps of two data are close, then it is concluded that two data are linked and further on treated as a single event. After all the data has been collected, cleaned and reduced data is transformed into a structured form numerals\ for forensic investigation Table1 TABLE I  D ATA T RANSFORMATION O PERATIONS  Date Converts into readable format Time Converted into seconds and initialized with numeric values Source Ip sips are concatenated and initialized into a numeric values Destination Ip dips are concatenated and initialized into a numeric values Attack Category Characterized by their manifestations, which might or might not include damage and subsequently substituted with numerical values Service Names Converted into numeric C  High-level fusion This level of processing measures the relations between the objects. The objects in previous level are data. The relationships between the data are called event aggregations Because single event may not be significant, but the aggregation of single data may reveal the attack  1 7  The data are aggregated on the basis of three things source target, and attack category. When there occurs a network intrusion, the lists of attacks occur in a sequence. Intruders come with a set of tools trying to achieve a specific goal   T h e ch oi ce of th e t ool s us ed i n  t h is proces s depends  upon the environmental situations of the described system Two types of results can be obtained by the detection procedure   Data that together make up an attack   Data that together represent the behavior of a single attacker The data file obtained after this level of processing is shown in Fig 1                 Fig.1. Data File D  Decision level fusion In this level processing, the an alysis is done by assessing the current situation and identification of threats by using Neural Network Tool Box of MATLAB to implement visualization into forensic digital investigation.  One of the neural network models that is used for modeling and clustering data is the Self Organizing Map \(SOM\he data in this concept is based on untrained set. The infrastructure of SOM is described as Input layer which is completely connected with the output layer unit and each unit in the input layer represents an input signal. The resultant obtained is to cluster or categorize similar patterns. It performs the following steps       Finding the matched weights: When the units of the input layer compete with the units of the output layer the units are matched and those weights are considered   Weights monitoring: Once these weights are matched, its surrounding units are shifted to the next input layer pattern The data file to be processed using this toolbox has to be in correct format. The column headin gs should be the first line and each data should start at a new line, as shown in Fig 1  


  These data are treated as Input pattern in SOM. For each entered data, the dimensions must be separated by spaces. But for the learning purposes the attribute names are converted into numeric values. The learning process is repeated up to default no of iterations until satisfactory \(exact\ results are obtained. A map is generated after this process in such a way that the original data remains unchanged. The map helps in inspecting possible correlations revealed by comparing the values in the input data. In this case study study since our attempt is to identify, detect and visualize IP spoofing threats the following logic has been implemented 1  Set sip = Source_IP_Address \(p 2  If sip  Internal database Then write “Intrusion  Else if sip  External database  Then write “Intrusion   Else no intrusion   Exit 3  Intrusion detected 4  Write Date of event, Time of event Source_IP_Address, Dest_IP_Address  onto the Forensic Log book 5  End Two separate databases are maintained an internal database that maintains a list of IP addresses that are internal to the banking network, and an External database that maintains all the IP addresses which are granted access to the network resources. The source IP address is compared with the content of the internal database and External database. If the IP address belongs to the in ternal database, then it is considered as an attempt for intrusion This is because usually an internal IP addresses cannot come to an external port. Similarly, if there is a mismatch in the IP address with any of the external database entries then it is also treated as an intrusion because an unknown IP address has attempted an entry into the network. In either of the cases once intrusion is suspected appropriate entries are made into the forensic log such as date of event, time of event, source IP address, and destination IP address, which can be further used during evidence report analysis V  T HE SOM  T RAINING ALGORITHM USED FOR THE CASE STUDY ANALYSIS  Step 1 In the input layer, where the network connection is layered, the properties are laid down. This unit will facilitate the SOM initiation to train the units Step 2 In-depth explanation of SOM is described Step 3 Initialization of the units in the output layer where every neuron will be assigned by a value randomly Step 4 The entire process is controlled by the parameters to signify differences in networks Step 5 Each unit is considered as a winning neuron Step 6 The uniqueness of the winning neuron along with the existing neurons among the neighborhood is updated Step 7 The above last two steps are repeated abundantly training length\ till results are obtained V  R ESULT A NALYSIS  The data file is processed using Neural Network Tool Box of MATLAB. The processing time and number of learning iterations is by default taken by the tool. During operation, the total 22000 data has been divided into testing data and training data. In the learning process, the neurons are moved to characterize the sample data as closely as possible. When a testing sample is tested by SOM, and its winning unit is located, it is symbolized as normal if it matches with the winner and flagged intrusion and if it satisfies the threshold limit. The results of analysis are then brought under discussions to generate results            Fig .2. Component Map             Fig.3. Sample hit    Fig.4. Neighboring weight distances  In figure 2 the component maps \(weight input 4 & 5\the different colors\(light yellow, dark yellow, light orange, dark orange\hows the sips of other sources, black color describes the sips of bank. This describes majority of the sips are clustered as yellow and dark yellow marked as intrusion needs further attention as it is done at the same time on the same day which is clear from 2 nd and 3 rd component maps.  Figure 3 shows the no of sample hits based on the algorithm. Figure 4 in the third map where the dark orange portion highlighted in 


the yellow region identifies the neighboring weight distance that has to be adjusted in the learning phase. SOM Visualization and training algorithm     w o rk s better since network threats are evolving day by day and Forensic database often contains voluminous and uncertain crime cases. Therefore, to make the detection observable in future, an integrated approach of data fusion along with neural network training algorithm incorporating visualization technique will work better VI  F ORENSIC LOGBOOK  The forensic Log book which is a record keeping system has been augmented into the architecture is used for analyzing the forensic data. The term forensics refers to the post-mortem analysis of evidence but in the context of network we refer the analysis of evidence as network forensics    Th e  digital information captured are maintained in the log book with a designed format like date of event and time of the event, Intruder and target IP address, name of event and status of event, source of data request \(for authentication\. A timestamp is introduced which denotes or implies a network threat VII  U SER INTERFACE  The Investigation tool also provides mechanism for the investigators to analyze. The tool categorizes the user’s activity and the units. The network administrator and network forensic experts can communicate with the forensic log book through user interface VIII  F EASIBILITY  As the approved and input weights are the two participants in the case stud y, the problems the courts are having are in dealing with the difference between the literature and legal evidence. For a case to be discussed in the court, we discuss the three requirements like      a   Authentication, \(b\ Results showing the best proofs \(c Exceptions from the proofs. Authentication refers to the truthiness. As per the investigator’s view, they will seek something that they can demonstrate to others long after the event itself is over i.e. the Evidence Log File. The primary goal is to identify the features that will have the capacity to fulfill the needs of the Law enforcement agencies in gathering the data and securing the continui ty of computer intrusions in order to present in the court for proving the crime IX  C ONCLUSION  Maintaining profiles tracking and seizing cyber suspects should be the most important area of research e anonymous concept in the networking’s have always encouraged criminals to mislead the performance which creates difficulties for the court authorities to prove the identity of the criminal. Network forensics has given opinion of increase of crimes performed by    computer terminals, a device that maintains all the database of the proofs of crimes To effectively combat such types of threats, its not just about investigating and coming to conclusions about a crime but what is more important to prosecute and administer justice according to the law of the land Also, the evidence gathering process in a computing environment, by their nature is technical and different to other forms of evidence gathering Data fusion along with visualization techniques promises to signify the preventions that can be taken for the future of cyber-crimes.  Future work of our project remains on the design of fusion algorithms and visualization techniques that can handle new kind of network threats so that digital information technology remains as a platform for well beings  R EFERENCES  1 A cce s s D at a Co r p o r atio n  h tt p   w w w acce s s da ta c o m   2 0 0 5   2 Be e b e  N  a n d Cl ar k J  D e al ing w i t h  te r a by te da ta s e ts  in  dig i tal  investigations, Advances in Digital Forensics, 2005, pp. 3-16, Springer 3 Ca s e y E   D i gi ta l E v id en c e and  C o m p u t er C r i m e: F o r e n s i c S c i e nc e  Computer and the Internet, Academic Press,2011 4  Cas e y  E., N  w tr af f i c as a s o ur ce o f ev ide n ce  to o l s t r e ng ths  w e akne s s e s   and future needs.

Experiment Setup Proposed attack scenario 
SECTION V EXPERIMENTS 
We allude to the lumps being Flush Reloaded by the advertisement versary as being observed since Flush-Reload basically screens access to information in the lump  Flushing a piece by means of clflush thus observing that piece should be possible without knowing the physical address of the lump since clflush takes the lump's virtual address for this situation in the adversary's address space as its operand  We call a quicker reload amid the Reload stage a watched occasion or perception  We additionally embrace ideas from measurable order and utilize the term false negative to allude to missed perceptions of the casualty's entrance to the checked piece and false positives to allude to watched occasions that are brought about by reasons other than the casualty's entrance to the observed piece We characterize a Flush-Reload convention in which the foe procedure screens a rundown of lumps at the same time and over and again until taught generally  It will first attempt to Reload the principal lump record the reload time and Flush it promptly thereafter At that point it will rehash these means on the second lump the third and so on until the last lump in the rundown  At that point the foe will sit tight for a precisely computed day and age before beginning once again from the primary piece so that the interim between the Flush and Reload of a similar lump is of an objective level 3 from the Reload of the main lump to the end of the holding up period is called one Flush-Reload cycle  An outline of the Flush-Reload convention is appeared in following Fig
