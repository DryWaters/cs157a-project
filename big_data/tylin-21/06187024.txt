objectives with a more modest budget on a longer development timescale A multitude of options have been studied with varying levels of cost risk and science value Flight and Ground system implementations have a direct bearing on many of these factors and will also be addressed The methodology and status of evaluating these options will be discussed A key distinguishing characteristic of  the projected DESDynI Radar measurement would be  large scale coverage and frequent  revisit  at fine resolution  This would be  enabled via a new Radar technique called SweepSAR Efforts to develop and field test SweepSAR will also be discussed as well as other technology developments underway that are associated with this mission  T

the Office of Management and Budget eliminated the Lidar sciencecraft and recommended a de scope in the Radar sciencecraft budget  Studies since then have focused on evaluating options for DESDynI Radar that would be more affordable    At the core of the proposed DESDynI Radar \(DESDynI R would be a highly capable L band Synthetic Aperture Rada r SAR system   This SAR would ride on a dedicated, high power, precisely pointed platform capable of high downlink rates  DESDynI R would fly in a highly repeatable orbit with short revisit times.

  2  and affecting climate Changes in ice sheets sea ice a nd glaciers are key indicators of these climate effects and are undergoing dramatic changes  Increasing rates of land ice melt is the primary contributor to eustatic sea level rise  DESDynI was a mission concept recommended by the National Academy of Sciences in 2007  t o  a d d r e s s  t h e s e  changes.  After several years of technical studies conducted by NASA, a robust mission concept has emerged that could observe these changes over the life of the mission contributing significantly to our understanding of processes and controlling mechanisms in each discipline  The primary mission objectives proposed for DESDynI are to 1 Determine the likelihood of earthquakes volcanic eruptions and landslides through deformation monitoring 2 Characterize the global distribution and changes of vegetation aboveground biomass and ecosystem structure related to the global carbon cycle, climate and biodiversity and 3\Predict the response of ice masses to climate change and impact on  sea level In addition DESDynI would provide observations that would greatly improve our monitoring of groundwater hydrocarbon and s equestered CO2 reservoirs DESDynI would be the first mission to systematically and globally study the solid Earth the ice masses and ecosystems all of which despite numerous capable international systems in orbit are too sparsely sampled to address m any important global scale problems in geohazards carbon and climate  These objectives were described in detail in   To address these objectives, the DESDynI project team has worked with the community to create a number of specific measurement requi rements that define the mission capabili ty  These requirements can be summarized as follows  000x  For Solid Earth deformation DESDynI is proposed to accurately measure 1 interseismic motion in two dimensions over the areas of the globe known to be deformin g at greater than 1 mm/yr rate 2 several hundred targeted phenomena of interest such as volcanoes coseismic and postseismic events and landslides over the life of the mission, primarily in the same areas as the interseismically deforming zones, but als o extended to other regions  These requirements lead to a global mapping system requiring rapid sampling using repeat pass radar interferometry the only known method to be able to deliver such measurements  Repeat pass interferometry requires that all t he images being combined are taken from a similar point relative to the target  Thus the orbital position must be repeatable, not just to keep the target within the scene, but to allow coherent interference  000x  For Ecosystem Structure DESDynI is proposed t o accurately estimate above ground woody biomass over the globe, at 100 m 000  1000 m spatial scales, and over a wide variety of biomes and biomass densities Polarimetric radar measurements would be used to measure biomass and biomass change  000x  For Dynamics of  Ice DESDynI is proposed to accurately measure ice sheet, glacier, and sea ice vector velocities comprehensively over the life of the mission To meet these requirements again the radar interferometry, as well as speckle  and feature tracking would used for measuring velocities  Clearly DESDynI would have many demands on its measurement systems The radar would operate in an orbit optimized to meet the kinds of sampling strategies required for the science wide swath fast repeat interferometry with wid ely spaced ground tracks   Figure 1  Proposed DE SDynI Radar imaging scenario and swath widths Using the SweepSAR method full swath could be imaged at full resolution. Note: figure not to scale  Other L band r adars are planned for operation by other nations but  none are designed to handle the data volumes and  rates to allow for these measurements at the global scale with system at ic repeated observations  The frequent and long term coverage that would be afforded by DESDynI and enabled by the wide swath of the SweepSAR technique would allow for the collection of the impacts of many infrequent events earthquakes volcanic eruptions landslides gl acier variations  low speed processes glacial recession inter seismic motion and globally dispersed measurements  biomass change  


  3  3  M ISSION D ESIGN  The mission and trajectory design plays a critical role i n the overall mission In addition to helping to meet the science objectives it also affects how the mission would be  operated and how the data would be  collected  Orbit Selection  The accuracy of the science measurements is tied to the orbit repeat interv al, with each science discipline preferring a different value. For phenomena related to deformation or cryospheric science where changes can occur quickly a shorter orbit repeat interval is desired For study of phenomena that vary on seasonal like time scales such as the case for ecosystem structure a much longer time interval is desired. For DESDynI, orbit studies have focused on intervals between 8 and 24 days with a 13 day repeat interval considered an acceptable baseline to all science communities   Within a selected orbit repeat interval options exist at different altitudes with the preferred range to be approximately 600 km to 800 km. This range is bounded on the lower end by limitations on the ability to achieve an adequate swath width and on t he upper end by the radar signal to noise ratio  One factor to consider in the mission and trajectory design when evaluating altitudes is the effect of atmospheric drag on our ability to maintain the spacecraft within a specific corridor This small diamond shaped corridor measuring 500 meters in the cross track direction and 650 meters in the radial direction would permit use of a simpler data processing system to create the interferograms that are needed by the DESDynI science community At the lower altitudes the effect of the atmosphere is much g reater resulting in a need to perform maneuvers daily At the higher altitudes the atmosphere does not affect the spacecraft as much, so maneuvers would be  less frequent  Another option to consider when it comes to determining orbit altitude is the per formance capability of the various launch vehicles In order to comply with NASA Orbit al  Debris requirements on disposal of the upper stage the smaller class of launch vehicles such as the Taurus or Minotaur would need to inject the spacecraft into an orb it lower than what would be desired for science. It would then be the responsibility of the spacecraft to carry additional propellant to achieve the science orbit For the larger class of launch vehicles, this is less of a constraint, as there would be  ade quate propellant remaining to deorbit the upper stage   Science Planning  Beyond the orbital mechanics and science implications of the orbit repeat interval there is also the impact on the planning and observation strategy One of the proposed objectives o f DESDynI would be  to provide global coverage 000R\000I\000\003\000W\000K\000H\000\003\000H\000D\000U\000W\000K\000¶\000V\000\003\000O\000D\000Q\000G\000\003\000D\000Q\000G\000\003\000L\000F\000H\000\003\000V\000X\000U\000I\000D\000F\000H\000V\000\003\000Z\000L\000W\000K\000L\000Q\000\003\000W\000K\000H\000\003\000V\000H\000O\000H\000F\000W\000H\000G\000\003\000R\000U\000E\000L\000W\000\003 repeat interval In the case of a shorter repeat interval this would translate into a greater percentage of the earth needing to be covered on any  given day. This would result in a larger daily data volume, when compared to a day from a longer repeat interval where less of the earth  would be  observed  TDRSS would be  the most desirable downlink architecture for DESDynI because it  offers a wide range of options for improved data volume capability DESDynI could choose between a higher data rate design combined with some minimal amount of TDRSS coverage time and  a moderate data rate design with increased coverage time However beca use TDRSS is a shared resource, there are limitations to the amount of coverage time that could  be requested  One combination of TDRSS parameters that would allow us to achieve the proposed DESDynI science objectives with a high level of confidence assumes  a 300Mbps data rate and 45 minutes of coverage per orbit This would result in a daily data volume capability of approximately 12 Terabits per day   4  SAR  I NSTRUMENT  SAR System Requirements & Design  The DESDynI SAR Instrument is still in the planning ph ase with the radar design efforts focused in two main areas  1  Flowing the science requirements into instrument design parameters and optimizing the instrument concept to minimize cost while satisfying the most science  2  Developing the instrument architecture to provide the optimal performance at the lowest cost, and identifying and developing any long lead components to mitigate technology risk  000\(\000D\000U\000O\000\\\000\003 000W\000U\000D\000G\000H\000\003 000V\000W\000X\000G\000L\000H\000V\000\003 000F\000R\000Q\000F\000O\000X\000G\000H\000G\000\003 000W\000K\000D\000W\000\003 000X\000V\000L\000Q\000J\000\003 000D\000\003 000³\0006\000Z\000H\000H\000S\0006\000$\0005\000´\000\003 scan on receive techniq ue implemented using an array fed reflector antenna geometry allowed for the most cost effective achievement of the key science requirements [1    1  wide swath to provide global coverage with a short repeat period  2  sensitivity  25dB NES 0  and ambiguities  15 to 20 dB\that take advantage of the large reflector  3  stability and calibratability taking advantage of the small compact feed array to house all active components  SAR Instrument Characteristics  The DESDynI radar would op erate at L band \(1.2 GHz, 24 cm wavelength  in a  sun synchronous orbit with an exact

Note: figure not to scale    SAR Operational Modes  There are essentially three primary modes of operation needed to meet  the proposed DESDynI science objectives  1  Single P olarization S plit S pectrum mode  with 20  MHz bandwidth at one end of the allocated  80 MHz radar band  and 5 MHz at the other end, is defined for repeat pass radar interferometric observations used for surface deformation measurements   The split band of operation would be  used to solve f or ionosphere induced errors in the interferometric phase   In addition the radar would be  required to fly an exact repeat orbit to within a few hundred meters in order to reduce the effects of geometric and volumetric decorrelation  2  For ecosystem science the primary mode of data collection  would be a specialized 20 MHz Quad P olarization mode covering the range of incidence angles from 30 o  to 45 o   This mode is really  two dual polarization modes, HH/HV at one end of the 80 MHz band and VV/VH at the  other end transmitted and received simultaneously   Acquisition in this mode would allow low pulse repetition rates and manageable ambiguities at the expense of not acquiring the full scattering matrix in a traditional quad polarimetric mode   3  For low re solution imaging of sea ice for the purpose of feature tracking a 5 MHz bandwidth Low Resolution Single Pol mode is defined to keep  the data volume  down   The spacecraft could  be rotated to either the left or right looking direction to observe both poles  and it is anticipated that this would be done seasonally  Data collections for all modes could occur on both ascending and descending orbits Other modes such as wide bandwidth 80 MHz single pol or full quad pol, would be used for specialized targets of  interest  The SAR instrument would take advantage of mature heritage designs to the extent possible and use existing commercially available components to implement the SweepSAR technique with an array fed reflector design No new techn ology development is needed 000  only engineering to adapt currently  000D\000Y\000D\000L\000O\000D\000E\000O\000H\000\003 000W\000H\000F\000K\000Q\000R\000O\000R\000J\000\\\000¶\000V\000\003 capability   SAR Technology  Reflector Boom and F eed/Electronics Structure 000 The  instrument mechanical elements would all use mature technologies  The low mass deployable mesh reflector along with its accompanying deployment boom, is  available from two manufacturers, both with extensively flight proven heritage systems in the 6 to 1 5 meter diameter range The feed/electronics structure would be constructed using thermally stable composite panels available from several

  6  The dataset from the eight receive channels would be used in the future for play back into the DESDynI SAR DSP testbed to demonstrate the real time processing algorithms    5  F LIGHT S YSTEM  The proposed DESDynI Flight system would be  comprised of the spacecraft bus and the L Band Radar payload The objective of the flight system team would be  to ensure the spacecraft bus design interfaces with the radar design appropriately and would be  able meet the mission requirements   It is the accommodatio n of this radar payload that poses a number of challenges to the flight system design most of which go beyond the physical accommodation of the radar feed and reflector. There are also a number of issues related to the data generation capability of this i nstrument These data would place significant demands on the data transfer storage downlink and ultimately the processing subsystems   Spacecraft Overview   As expected the L band radar payload would be  different from what has flown previously, but at first glance, a lot of the traits of the spacecraft bus design would closely match those of other earth orbiting missions. The spacecraft would be  a three axis stabilized system dependent on items such as r eaction wheels, Inertial Measurement Units \(IMUs\ and star trackers to maintain attitude control and torque rods to manage momentum accumulation A standard RAD750 computer would manage the command and control function on the spacecraft Tracking Telemet ry and Command TT&C\ data would  all be sent via S band. The total mass of the fully fueled flight system would be  approximately 2 metric tons, with orbital average power requirements on the order of 2 kilowatts All of this could be packaged to fit within  either an Intermediate class launch vehicle \(i.e Atlas  V  Delta  IV  Falcon9 or smaller launch vehicles such as the Delta  II Taurus or Minotaur series launch vehicles   Physical Accommodation Challenges  The biggest challenge affecting the physical con figuration of the flight system design is the need to overcome gravity gradient torques By having large non equivalent masses distributed several meters apart, the gravity gradient torques could  be fairly significant In order to overcome this configurat ion induced torque several options were examined. One option considered was to use a large balance mass \(on the order of 300kg\to counteract the mass of the reflector In this configuration the gravity gradient torque was effectively canceled out. Howev er, designing a system to deploy a 300kg mass was deemed too costly A more elegant solution, and one that is part of the proposed design today would be to use the solar array as the counteracting mass. By deploying the array in the direction of nadir, an d having a two axis gimbal an equally effective system for cancelling out the gravity gradient torque would be  realized   The other significant challenge with flying such a large reflector is finding a suitable arrangement for the various sensors needed t o operate spacecraft. These include the star trackers sun sensors and GPS antennas A further complication affecting the placement of these sensors is the desire to fly the spacecraft with the instrument pointed to either the left or right of the groundt rack By adding the capability to yaw the spacecraft 180 degrees, observation of the both the North and South Polar regions would be  permitted, but would eliminate the possibility of having of a dedicated side of the spacecraft with a near constant view of  deep space, which is commonly preferred for these types of sensors   In order to overcome this issue, and the blockage from the deployed reflector additional sensors would be needed In the case of sun sensors a total of one to two dozen sun sensors wo uld be needed to provide near 4pi steradian coverage Complete 4pi steradian coverage is not achievable in the reflector concept envisioned for DESDynI\ To improve GPS reception, a third antenna was added to the top of the boom to augment the performanc e of the two that are installed on the zenith deck of the spacecraft Though the third antenna has a near optimal view to the GPS constellation, it is subject to the dynamics of the boom and therefore addition al  antennas would be  needed on the spacecraft bus to achieve the Precision Orbit Determination \(POD\accuracy required by DESDynI    Data Handling Challenges  Beyond the physical accommodation challenges there are also issues related to the data coming from the radar. A lot of these issues demand a ree xamination of the design choices that are typically used on Earth Science missions   The first hurdle that needed to be addressed was the transfer of the data from the radar to the spacecraft Typically payloads send their data to the spacecraft using either an RS 422 or LVDS interface. However, these interfaces peak at data rates of 10 M bps and 400 Mbps respectively For this radar when operating in the fully polarimetric mode quad polarization\, the data rate can be as high as 1.6 Gbps per polarization channel. In order to handle such a high data rate using one of the standard interfa ces several data lines operating in parallel would be required Again this was being  prohibitively costly since both the spacecraft and radar payload would need to manage each of those individual data links independently Another option being actively p ursued is the serial deserializer SERDES interface which can handle data rates as high as 2.5 Gbps Using just a couple of these interfaces the bandwidth available would more than adequately span the range of radar capability being considered    In addition to the high data transfer rate there is also the challenge of storing and downlinking these data.  Depending on which class  of science requirements is envisioned for this mission the onboard data storage requirements c ould  vary 


  7  significantly  In order to achieve the more advanced science objectives, an onboard storage system capable of 4 Terabits would be  needed  If a more modest level of science objectives is chosen then a sub Terabit amount of storage would  be adequate The other aspect of  sizing the data storage system is the telecommunications link that would be  used to send data to the Earth. Here again, DESDynI needs to evaluate alternative design options from what is commonly used in an earth science mission   Typically science missio ns use the NASA Near Earth Network NEN to communicate with the ground and to receive their downlink. With most ground stations located at the higher northern latitudes, a spacecraft in LEO can expect to overfly a ground station nearly once every orbit an d have a downlink session lasting between 7 and 15 minutes Combined with the existing capabilities of these stations to receive data at rates up to 150 Mbps the maximum data volume return per orbit is limited to less than 150 Gigabits Though upgrades ar e planned to increase the data rate capability to 300 Mbps the short downlink durations still limit the data volume to less than 250 Gbits   With this level of data volume, the DESDynI Radar would only be permitted to operate for about 5 7 minutes per orbi t on average This would limit the scope of global coverage for the mission. Various other alternatives were considered such as the use of commercial ground stations or an optical communication system Both these options would offer much higher data rates  but once again cost was a constraining factor and these options were  not pursued further   The most appealing option available to DESDynI is the use of the NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System TDRSS In addition to providing near continuous d ownlink opportunities it permits the use of much higher data rates  By taking advantage of the 650MHz Ka Band channel that exists on the second generation TDRSS \(F8, 9 10 DESDynI could transmit data at a rate as high as 1.2 Gbps   The other benefit of  using TDRSS is the arrival point of data on the Earth is within the continental United States White Sands, New Mexico\ This is advantageous over the NEN sites at places like Svalbard Norway or Poker Flats Alaska, because the bandwidth available to tra nsfer data to JPL and the science community is significantly larger    6  S CIENCE D ATA S YSTEM  The main function of the Science Data System \(SDS\ is to receive level 0 radar data and ancillary data to produce a set of science data products that would meet the objectives of the three DESDynI science disciplines 000 solid earth cryosphere, and ecosystem structure   Key Challenges  Under this proposal, the DESDynI SDS design is driven by the sheer amount of data received from the spacecraft and radar instrument. Th e DESDynI radar is expected to  collect 12 Tbits of radar s ignal data each day  This data would be downlinked via TDRSS at 300 Mbps Ka band for a 45 minute downlink period per orbit to the science data center   However, this is not necessarily the upper limi t of the data return The DESDynI study could return up to 40 Tbits of radar data each day if the on board telecom system upgrade to 1Gbps Ka band downlink is carried out In addition to processing extremely large data volumes another SDS design challenge  is the major effort to improve automation in order to reduce operations cost   Implementation Strategy  Due to the challenges posed by the DESDynI study the design of the hardware the catalog system and the processing system was carefully examined Du ring the mission concept development phase, a few key studies were made   The first key study was the hardware design study Because of the expandable requirements levied by the study and the potential number of requirements that would need reprocessing, a question arose: which type of storage space and operating computing environment would best fit 000'\000\(\0006\000'\000\\\000Q\000,\000¶\000V\000\003\000Q\000H\000H\000G\000V\000"\000\003\0007\000K\000H\000\003\000R\000S\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000V\000\003\000R\000I\000\003\000F\000O\000R\000X\000G\000\003\000F\000R\000P\000S\000X\000W\000L\000Q\000J\000\017\000\003\000U\000H\000Q\000W\000L\000Q\000J\000\003 hardware and buying hardware were carefully evaluated However due to funding uncertainties a tempora ry conclusion was made purchase a small set of hardware to use as a testbed for initial algorithm development and as a potential future hardware platform  This strategy will not only support immediate algorithm and software development but also reduce r isk of potential future hardware obsolescence  The second key study was to identify which potential heritage cataloging and processing system DESDynI should use During the DESDynI study period the Soil Moisture Active Passive SMAP mission had already b een developing its SDS for quite some time SMAP has inherited the design from the heritage JPL Process and Control System which was also used by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory OCO N P P Sounder PEATE Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space ACOS and OCO 2  projects The Science Processing and Data Management SPDM subsystem is the brain of the operations environment of the SMAP SDS The SPDM provides the function that allows for automation of the science data processing so that the computer system can  operate 24 hours a day seven days a week relieving the operators of this time consuming task The SPDM would automatically ingest external files to the SDS staging area then prepare and move ingested files from the staging area to the local storage.  A  work flow manager and resource manager under the SPDM would then move track monitor and dispatch the input files to various computer nodes for different level processes meta data generation cataloging and data 


  8  distribution  A high level view of the SDS is shown in Figure 4  The DESDynI P roject would process all radar data to Level 0a decommu tated raw data Level 0 b  reformatted and conditioned raw data and Level 1 single look complex images The project would be able to produce calibrated and v alidated geo  and biophysical products for each of the science disciplines  For the study of earthquakes volcanoes and other crustal processes a key data product would be  geocoded two  and three dimensional surface deformation models accurate on the or der of millimeters per year   For glaciology, the project would be able to produce two and three dimensional models of glacier and ice sheet velocities accurate to order 1 m/yr  For ecosystem structure key products would include polarimetric decompositi on maps forest cover biomass and seasonal change maps accurate to 20    Figure 4: SDS Architecture   An innovative approach has come to the attention of the developers.  Rather than simply inherit the design and create another instance of SDS for DESDynI the developers decided to team up with the SMAP SDS and treat the DESDynI radar as another instrument  of a larger SDS under the same processing and data management of the larger SDS.  This instrument would ha ve  its own processing logic however it would use the same infrastructure and framework of design and implementation This concept would allow for a n integrated SDS design   7   S UMMARY  The proposed DESDynI Radar mission has the potential to provide unprecedented continuous long term data sets that would greatly enhance science in multiple disciplines.  The mission would require the use of new SAR t echniques like SweepSAR to achieve the wide swath at a reasonable cost Trades in ground and flight systems, along with partnership discussions are generating a set of options for the science community and NASA to evaluate and consider implementing late in this decade   Acknowledgement  This research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Zhiqiong Wang et al Distributed and Weighted Extreme Learning Machine for Imbalanced Big Data Learning 171 classes the optimization effect is still good Finally we investigate the impact of imbalance ratio As shown in Fig 8a with the increasing imbalance ratio the training times of the ELM 003   DW-ELM and IDW-ELM algorithms are basically stable and the training time of the IDW-ELM algorithm is always lower than that of the DW-ELM algorithm Also the training time of the ELM 003  algorithm is lower than that of the IDW-ELM algorithm The variation in speedup ratio of changing the imbalance ratio of the training records is shown in Fig 8b and the speedup ratio remains stable Increasing the imbalance ratio did not produce any substantial effects on the calculation process of the MapReduce job so the training time is relatively stable Since the training time of the IDW-ELM algorithm is less than that of the DWELM algorithm this further veri\002es the validity of the improved algorithm From the results of the six groups the training time of the ELM 003  algorithm is less than that of the DWFig 8 The impact of the imbalance ratio on 050a\051 time and 050b\051 speedup ratio ELM algorithm in each group of experiments The reason is because in the DW-ELM algorithm training process the number of samples in each category needed to be 002rst counted that is calculate the diagonal elements of the weight matrix W in the Map phase then the H T H and H T T matrices were calculated in the MapReduce calculation while only H T H and H T T matrices needed to be counted in the Map phase of the ELM 003  algorithm However the G-mean value of the ELM 003  algorithm in managing the unbalanced data was signi\002cantly lower than that of the DW-ELM algorithm which apparently was not applicable to the imbalance BD learning 5 Conclusion Neither the WELM nor the DELM algorithms manage the imbalanced big training data ef\002ciently since they only consider either the 223big\224 or the 223imbalanced\224 aspect of imbalanced big training data and not both In this study we proposed a DW-ELM algorithm based on the MapReduce framework The DW-ELM algorithm makes full use of the parallel computing ability of the MapReduce framework and realizes ef\002cient learning of imbalanced BD Speci\002cally through analyzing the characteristics of the WELM algorithm we found that the matrix multiplication operators 050i.e H T WH and H T WT 051 within the WELM algorithm are decomposable Then we transformed the corresponding matrix multiplication operators into summation forms which suited the MapReduce framework well and proposed a DWELM algorithm to calculate the matrix multiplications using two MapReduce jobs Furthermore an IDWELM algorithm which only uses one MapReduce job to complete the tasks was proposed to improve the performance of the DW-ELM algorithm Finally in the cluster environment we performed a detailed validation of the performance of the DW-ELM and IDW-ELM algorithms with various experimental settings The experimental results show that the DW-ELM and IDWELM algorithms can learn imbalanced BD ef\002ciently Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 050Nos 61402089 61472069 and 61501101\051 the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 050Nos N161904001 N161602003 and N150408001\051 the Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province 050No
