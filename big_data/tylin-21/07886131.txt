Building Issue-Data Maps to Support the Resolution of Socio-National Issues Focusing on the Issue of increase in domestic inflow of foreign infectious diseases Mi-Nyeong Hwang, Seungwoo Lee Convergence Technology Research Division Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information mnhwang, swlee}@kisti.re.kr Heeyoung Oh 2E Consulting oohy@2e.co.kr Abstract 227 Owing to the development of big-data-related technology, interest on systematic methodology that determines policies has been increasing based on data in the public health field. In this study, a method is proposed to establish an issue data map required to discover main national and social issues based on the data and solve issues through cooperation with domain experts. First, main issues with socially high interest are selected through literature review and analysis on news and search trends. Next, the factors that influence these selected issues are analyzed, and specific monitoring items of each driving force are selected to investigate the related data. In addition, a map is established to interconnect researchers with considerable experience in issue domain research and policy decision organizations that have decision-making capacity to solve the issues. This study empirically shows the process of establishing an issue map on a main social issue, which is the 223 increase in domestic inflow of foreign infectious diseases 224 Efficient policy decision making will be possible if an issue-detection system that enables constant monitoring based on this issue map is established Issue-data map issue detection issue monitoring man 226 machine collaboration horizon scanning; decisionsupport I I NTRODUCTION Since the early 2000s, various open data have been revealed according to the 223 Open Government and Open Data 224 by the UK and USA. Subsequently the data-processing industry of these open data which creates new values by analyzing the open data was activated 1 2  Neve rth el ess  p r o b l em s rem ain  Although obtainable data have rapidly increased obtaining information with proper form within a restricted time remains difficult. For example policy decisions to effectively manage diseases such as footand-mouth disease or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or to respond to disasters such as floods or landslides due to localized heavy rain must be made within a limited time through quick data processing However, big data processing tools or environments that can efficiently solve these problems have not yet been established [3  Detecting factors that can possibly cause problems in the future by investigating data in various fields is called horizon scanning [4  It  is sim ila r to m o n i t o r i n g  and detecting projection factors that can potentially threaten the horizontal line of boundless oceans Nations such as Singapore and UK have already installed and are operating national-level horizonscanning organizations for effective prediction [5  A method to establish a data map to support efficient decision making by detecting the main issues that threaten the nation and society is described in the present study. The purpose of establishing an issue map is to easily search issue-related data, researchers and decision-making system to support reason-based decision making and acquire a passage role of connecting issue-related policies and R&D. In this study, selection process, data that become the target of monitoring to solve each issue, related researchers and procedure of establishing interconnected maps of related policy decision makers will be specifically dealt with based on main national and social issues II D ATA B ASED I SSUE S EARCHING Issues that must be solved by defining problems and needs that appear in megatrends that are socially shown and issues that must be prepared for the future are included in the search A Issue-Searching Process The issue-searching process of the main national and social issues is described as follows 1 Searching of candidate issue: a list of candidate issues is se lected through literature review to select issues with high social interest 2 Issue analysis analysis is conducted in the aspect of searches and news trends on the candidate issues investigated through literature review 227 Search trend analysis search pattern analysis on users of core keywords related to an issue using Naver DataLab 1 1 http://datalab.naver.com 343 


227 News trend analysis: analysis on the change in media interest by investigating the increase rate of news using Naver New Library 2  3  Selection of main issues: main issues are selected through primary and secondary filtering. New social issues are primarily filtered through search trend analysis, and issues with high social influence are secondarily filtered via news trend analysis 4  Analysis of main issues: driving forces that influence selected issues are analyzed 5  Expert counseling: issue influence is verified and feedback is received from domain experts 6  Establishment of issue-data map and analysis report: a data map of data, researchers, and policy decision makers that considers the driving forces is established, and an analysis report is written   Figure 1  Data-based issue searching process B  Cases of Issue Searching Based on Data By performing search and news trend analyses on 32 candidate issues in 18 fields through the issuesearching process mentioned earlier, 10 main issues were selected. As of April 2016, the national and social issues searched in the Republic of Korea are as follows 227 Searching and preparation of new technology to enter the hyper-connected society 227 Preparation of digital financial revolution block chain/FinTech 227 Increase in cybercrimes such as mobile finance frauds and hacking 227 Increase in home meal alternate food 227 Increase in respiratory diseases due to air pollution \(fine and yellow dust 227 Increase in domestic inflow of infectious diseases that occur in foreign regions 227 Necessity to manage the influence of air and marine pollution among nations 227 Preparation for refugee problem spreading   2  http://newslibrary.naver.com/search/searchDetails.nhn  227 Necessity to guarantee safety of chemical products 227 Early alarm and preparation for terror III  C ASES OF I SSUE D ATA M AP E STABLISHMENT  In this section, actual cases on issue-data map establishment on the issue of 223 increase in domestic inflow of infectious diseases that occur in foreign regions 224 among the 10 main issues are described Online media is useful in collecting early information on infectious diseases in real time. The period of infectious-disease-related information coming out differs depending on the feature of each medium, and the quickest information sources of each step in the infectious disease outbreak curve are analyzed [6  S o ci al n etw ork a n d bl og a r e s o u r ces  th at  can provide infectious-disease information before the spreading period of infectious diseases, and the range of information acquisition source widens as time passes. If these features are well used, unusual signs can be understood before the step of collecting the number of diagnosed patients is reached, and immediate measures can be initiated Therefore, preventing the spread of infectious diseases that come from foreign regions is important for early detection and quick correspondence. The World Health Organization \(WHO\ is leading intelligent surveillance of disease outbreaks by emphasizing the significance of real-time information collection and early correspondence. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control \(ECDC are also collecting various information for rapid disease surveillance and correspondence. Because the importance of proactive correspondence on infectious diseases is increasing, platforms such as ProMEDMail 3 HealthMap 4 and MediSys 5 that provide disease information based on various atypical data without depending only on official information by health authorities are established. Moreover, the importance of prediction technology using this information is also increasing. Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeler 6  developed by IBM, InfluSim 7 developed by Germany Epidemic Simulation System 8 developed by USA, and Global Epidemic and Mobility Model 9 are examples  f t h e s e t e c hnol o gi e s    A  Analysis of Driving Forces Collecting and monitoring data based on driving forces that influence the change in the future is important, instead of simply collecting much information. For this issue analysis, driving forces are derived in terms of Society, Technology, Environment Population, Politics, Economy, and Resources [8   The derivations of these driving forces and correlation   3 ProMED-mail, http://www.promedmail.org 4 HealthMap, https://www.healthmap.org/en 5 MediSys, http://medisys.newsbrief.eu 6 STEM, http://www.eclipse.org/stem  7 InfluSim, http://www.influsim.info 8 EpiSIM http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/joanamargarida/websiteProject  9 GLEAM, http://www.gleamviz.org  344

The analysis results are shown in Fig. 2 Higher correlation with issue occurrence was located closer to the center of the hemisphere. The most important driving forces were selected as \(S1 223 Outbreak of infectious diseases in foreign regions 224  and \(E2 223 Outbreak and transfer of infection medium 224 This result indicates that quickly and accurately obtaining information on infectious diseases and infection medium outbreak in foreign regions is a significant key in solving this issue. \(P2 i.e., \223 Outbreak of infection in classes with vulnerable health 224 which occurs after inflow, was known to have a relatively low correlation, but an average of higher than three points from the five-point scale of the expert evaluation results on all driving forces is still meaningful as an object of management   Figure 2  Results of the analysis on the correlation between driving forces and issue of 221 increase in domestic inflow of infectious diseases that occur in foreign regions 222  B  Establishment of Issue-Data Map An issue map based on these derived driving forces must be established. The issue map must support reason-based decision making by easily approaching data, researchers, and decision making systems that are related to the corresponding issue and by connecting with issue-related policies and R&D Thus, related specific monitoring items were analyzed by each driving force. For example, specific monitoring items on \(S1 223 Outbreak of infectious diseases in foreign regions 224 include 223 untranslated virus information 224  223 information on foreign infectious disease outbreak 224  223 information on variant virus of existing infectious disease outbreak 224  223 research information on new infectious disease 224  223 statistics of infectious disease outbreak in foreign regions 224 and 223 information related to warning or banned overseas travel areas to the main advanced countries 224 The issue map is established based on these specific items The issue map is composed of three maps, namely the data, researcher, and decision-making-system maps. First, the data map provides information on the domestic and foreign data sources that can be used to manage and monitor infectious diseases that occur in foreign regions. The data related to the outbreak of infectious diseases are from foreign sites, and the data related to the inflow and spreading within the Republic of Korea are from Korean sites. A total of 86 sources are included in this data map, and Table  lists the information on the main organizations and websites that provide information that can be seen in the data map TABLE II  M AIN P UBLIC O RGANIZATION S HOWN IN THE D ATA M AP  ID Organization of Open Data Site Name S1 WHO WHO Europe Media Monitor  MediSys International Society for Infectious Diseases ProMED-mail Boston Children\222s Hospital  HealthMap Council Foreign Relations Vaccine-Preventable Outbreaks United States National Library of Medicine MedlinePlus ECDC Epidemic Intelligence TESSy S2 Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System GDACS GDACS Korea Meteorological Administration Korea Meteorological Administration S3 Ministry of Strategy and Finance National Competitiveness Statistics Statistics Korea KOSIS S4 Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, Open Data Portal Ministry of Health and Welfare Centers for Disease Control & Prevention 345

The Ministry of Health and Welfare, Ministry of Public Safety and Security, Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs, Korea Customs Service, and Ministry of Justice are the main organizations included in the decision-making system map related to infectious diseases that occur in foreign regions. The Center for Disease Control & Prevention, which is an affiliated organization of the Ministry of Health and Welfare plays the key role IV  C ONCLUSION  Proper early response to main national and social issues such as outbreak of foreign infectious diseases using quick collection of information is most important. However, explosively increasing data have changed the core issue of this activity. Efficient management of data has become more important than gathering data. The establishment of the issue map proposed in this study provides information that can connect policy decision makers to proper experts and quickly collect reliable data on issues that can severely threaten public safety. By systematically establishing this map and providing information service based on the results, detection and response systems on main national and social issues can be significantly developed A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research was supported by \223Building Scientific Big Data Sharing and Convergence System K-16-L03-C01-S04 224   R EFERENCES   1  UKtransparency and CabinetofficeUK Open Data White Paper: Unleashing the Potential 2012 223Open Government  Data.gov,\224 usa.gov 2009.

S Yang et al  Semantic Inference on Clinical Documents Combining Machine Learning Algorithms With an Inference Engine  TABLE 7 Comparison of different classifiers used in CDTS and determine the one whose symptoms are the closest to those of the new patient at this stage and its corresponding treatment strategy is hereby applied to the patient at this stage It is of note that the treatment phase numbers of the old and new medical records might not be the same in this case Afterward the treatment phase number for the new patient is adjusted to the historical medical record's next treatment phase number Repeat Rule1 until the patient fully recovers For example a dataset  will be established when the symptoms of a new patient in the third phase do not match the historical records at the same time point Then we go through all of the records again and if any two phases of one historical record share similar symptoms with the 034rst two phases of the new patient it will be kept in   Given that any historically successful treatment 021 has m treatment phases on average the comparison procedure will be conducted C 2 m D m\050m 000 1\051  2 times at most If there are n cases then the time complexity is O\050n 003 m 2 051 This method is used to capture extended similar historical cases After the establishment of   all of the phases of the cases in  are compared with the third phase of the new patient treatment on the symptoms to 034nd the most similar one with the maximum rank at the similarity measurement matrix   which determines the treatment strategy for the new patient at the third phase C RESULTS AND ANALYSIS To enlarge the training dataset we randomly resample the dataset 1000 times without replacement by using the 034lter Resample in Weka In Table 7 iOVFDT constructs the smallest tree model compared with the other three classi\034ers in terms of the nodes leaves and depth HT and HAT also perform well in the construction of a nice tree model with 97 and 116 nodes 50 and 58 leaves and 21 and 23 depths respectively HOT has the largest tree size with more nodes and leaves which implies training dataset over\034tting As shown in Figs 8 and 9 Hoeffding-based tree classi\034ers have better performance compared to iOVFDT in terms of the classi\034cation correctness 050i.e accuracy\051 and kappa statistic 050i.e stability\051 With continuous incoming instances the accuracy and stability of Hoeffding-based tree classi\034ers rise with some 035uctuation while the performance of iOVFDT is kept at a horizontal level Similar to HAT the voted ensemble FIGURE 8 Comparison of classification correctness FIGURE 9 Comparison of the Kappa statistic FIGURE 10 Comparison of the evaluation time of the CPU multi-classi\034cation algorithm 050VEMCA\051 also performs well in terms of accuracy and stability and outperforms HAT when the number of instances is larger than 340000 Figs 10 and 11 compare the evaluation time of the CPU and the memory cost of the 034ve classi\034cation algorithms iOVFDT shows the fastest speed and the smallest memory cost among the 034ve classi\034cation algorithms HT gives better performance than HAT and HOT with 6.93 seconds in CPU occupation and a 0.91-Mb memory cost VEMCA's evaluation time and memory are 20.73 seconds and 1.62 Mb respectively VOLUME 5 2017 3543 


S Yang et al  Semantic Inference on Clinical Documents Combining Machine Learning Algorithms With an Inference Engine  FIGURE 11 Comparison of the memory cost VIII CONCLUSIONS Modern techniques such as CDSS and HIS have substantially facilitated clinical diagnosis and treatment However some of the emergent problems remain to be considered The 034rst problem is challenging the traditional data analysis techniques due to rapidly increasing amounts of multidimensional clinical data The second is the dif\034culty of clinical information integration Clinical information from different contexts are heterogeneous in terms of structure and semantics For the bene\034t of patients and long-term clinical development it is very promising to integrate clinical information 050e.g outpatients medical records\051 from different clinicians or hospitals to assist in clinical decision-making The third problem is the call for personalized medicine and professional medical treatment because different doctors or hospitals are good at diagnosing and treating different diseases and the patients have the freedom to choose among them To solve the three problems above this paper proposes a clinical diagnosis and treatment system 050CDTS\051 that assists patients in choosing clinicians or hospitals according to their requirements 050e.g distance from home to hospital\051 The foundation for disease detection in CDTS consists of decision trees that are created by our voted ensemble multiclassi\034cation algorithm that enables decision-tree-based data stream mining Furthermore to integrate clinical documents and heterogeneous health information systems a new clinical tabular document model is proposed which represents clinical documents in tabular format and maintains consistent vocabulary terms and semantic relations among different contexts through the term chain and semantic relation chain Additionally a novel semantic inference algorithm is designed for disease detection and treatment suggestion based on the rules that are generated by decision trees and similarity computations among medical records The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows 342 A uni\034ed clinical tabular document model 050CTDM\051 implemented by a new clinical tabular document language 050DocLang XML based\051 facilitates the interoperability among different clinical decision support systems 050CDSS\051 342 A new voted ensemble multi-classi\034cation algorithm is proposed in terms of running multiple decision treebased classi\034cation algorithms simultaneously on the same data stream and voting for the best output The results are associated with statistical information on the accuracy of classi\034cation which provides proof of optimization 342 A novel clinical diagnosis and treatment system with a newly designed semantic inference algorithm supports clinicians in the decision making process as well as saving time and expense for the patients For future work it is necessary to expand DocLang to become a more comprehensive markup language by importing more semantic relation types for more complex clinical documents These studies are in progress and are expected to present valuable results later REFERENCES   M A Makary and M Daniel Medical error\026The third leading cause of death in the US BMJ  vol 353 p i2139 May 2016   D Kopec M H Kabir D
