post can be measured by \nthe length of the post.  \n \nThe Influence Score for a blog is defined as a function of social \nconventions. These parameters help the model to trace the \nintuitive influence flow among the blogs. The influence flow of \nblog post p is calculated as \n???????????????? ? ??? ? ?????\n???\n???\n n??\n???\n???? ?? \n \n19\nwhere win and wout are the weights used to adjust the contributions nof incoming and outgoing influences, respectively; I\(pm pn and outlinks, respectively. \n \nFor a blog post p that has i inlinks and ? outlinks, the influence \nscore can be calculated by the following equation: \n \n???? ? ????? ??????? ? ????????????????????? ?? \n \nwhere w received by p, and \nwcom is the weight parameter used to normalize the contribution of \nthe number of comments. \nThe influence score is calculated for each blog post p that belongs \nto blogger B. The highest scored blog post of all influence scores \nof blogger B is represented as the InfluenceIndex of blogger B nInfluenceIndex\(B I\(pi The \nbloggers who have achieved top InfluenceIndex values are the \nmost influential ones out of the total number of bloggers. \n \n3.2 Productivity and Temporal Aspects \nThe influential flow method was able to set up the framework for \nthe influential bloggers problem , yet the model ignores the \ntemporal aspects of blogs which is very crucial for the \nblogosphere. Akritidis, L., Katsaros, D., and Bozanis, P. proposed \na new model that investigated the problem by two easily \ncomputable blogger scoring methods. These methods define two nmetrics MEIBI & MEIBIX that considered both temporal and \nproductivity aspects of the blogger [2]. \nThe influential factors considered for this model are inlinks, \ncomments, productivity, and time \(i.e. the age of the blog post and \nthat of the inlinks to the blog post model.  \nTable 1: Notion used in MEIBI & MEIBIX model \nSymbol Meaning \nBP\(j i Blogger j’s post i. \nCj \(i i blogger j. \n?TPj\(i i Difference in days between current date and \ndate referral post i submitted. \n \nMEIBI: \(Metric for Evaluating and Identifying Blogger’s \nInfluence received by a blog post, along with the date of \npublication. A blog post posted today will become outdated after a \nfew months or even a few days.  \nThe score Smj\(i ncalculated as follows: \n????? ? ??????? ? ?? ? ?????? ? ?????????????? ?? \nwhere ? and are constants assigned values 4 and 1 respectively.  \nAfter calculating score Smj\(i model assigns \nBlogger j a MEIBI index value equal to m if and only if m blog \nposts of blogger j have received a score >= m and the remaining \nBP\(j MEIBI eXtended of considering the age of the post we can decay the score \nfor each blog, based on the age of the received inlinks. For each \nincoming link we assign a weight that depends on the age of the \ninlink. The idea is formulated and a new score Smj\(i n????????\n???? ?? \nAfter calculating score Smj\(i j a MEIBIX index value equal to x if and only if x blog \nposts of blogger j received got a score >= x and remaining BP\(j nA blogger will be influential if and only if he/she blogs influential \nposts very often.  \n3.3 Productive and Influential Bloggers \nThe MEIBI & MEIBIX indexes considered both the temporal \naspects and productivity of the blogs, yet they failed to \ndifferentiate between productivity and influence. The same \nauthors Akritidis, L Katsaros, D., & Bozanis, P. refined their \nprevious model by considering the following two impacts [3 nProximal Impact: Indicates the blogger’s influence on regular \nusers/members of the community. This is measured through the \ncomments received on a post. \nWide Impact: Indicates the blogger’s influence outside the ncommunity. This is measured through inlinks used by other \nbloggers outside the community. \nTable 2: Notion of Productive and Influential bloggers model \n \nSymbol Meaning \nPjt Blogger j’s Productivity at instance t n20\nIjt Blogger j’s Influence at instance t \nNj Blogger j’s blog posts \nnji Blogger j’s post i. \nCji Comments on blog post i of blogger j. \nRji Inlinks received by blog post i of blogger j. \nLji Length of blog post i of blogger j \nL Average length of blog post of blogger. \nT Time variable  \ntji,p Time stamp of post i of blogger j \ntjx,l Time stamp of post x referring blogger j \ntjx,c Comment x’s time stamp on post of blogger j. \n nProductivity \(BP-index t n????\n? ??? ? ? ??\n?\n? ?\n?\n? ? ????? ? ?\n?\n?\n???? ?? \nwhere ?, ?, ? are predefined constants whose values are 100, \n86400, and 1, respectively. The score Uji,p\(t decays with time.  \nThe blogger’s productivity index, BP-index, defines the \nproductivity of a blogger in terms of recent lengthy blog posts \nsubmitted by a blogger: \nBased on the score Uji,p\(t 


the model assigns \nblogger j a BP- index value at a given instance t, equal to Pjt if and \nonly if Pjt blog posts of blogger j has got a score >= Pjt and the  \nremaining BP\(j BI-index and wide impact can be quantified as follows. \n \nFirst, the score Vji,p\(t received \nby post with their corresponding ages and its score decaying with \ntime: \n????\n? ??? ? ?? ? ?\n?\n n?\n?\n?????\n?\n??? ? ?\n?\n? ? ????? ? ?\n?\n?\n?????\n?\n???? ?? \nwhere wl = 100 and  wc = 10 nNext, BI-index, the blogger’s influence index that defines \ninfluential bloggers in terms of recent influence, is given as \nfollowing: \nBased on the score Vji,p \(t nblogger j a BI-index value, at a given instance t, equal to Ijt , if and \nonly if Ijt blog posts of blogger j received a score >= Ijt and the  \nremaining BP\(j appreciates blog posts that receive many \ninlinks and comments. \n \n4. OUR APPROACH \n \nIn this section, we first discuss the influential factors considered \nin our approach. Next, we present the procedures followed to find \ninfluential bloggers in a blog community.  \n \n4.1 Influential factors \n \nFirst of all, we observe a modern blog post. Figure 1 depicts one \nof the blog posts from the engadget web blog community, from \nwhich a dataset is used for our experiments \(Section 5 post body, \nauthor name, date of post, comments, number of facebook-likes, \nfacebook-shares, twitter shares etc. \n \nFigure 1: Sample blog post content and parameters \n21\nBefore reading anything online, many people tend to look at the \nnumber of hits \(visitors facebook likes, G +1’s etc facebook, twitter etc nhits, likes and sharing are natural influential factors for the current \nliterature posted. The act of clicking on facebook like, G +1 or \nsharing on social web sites most likely indicates the interest or napproval of the web content read. The number of views, facebook \nlikes, G +1’s on a web blog post can be treated as the direct \ninfluence received by the post, similar to inlinks. People who \nshare on facebook and twitter are supporting and voting for the \nweb content, so capturing those shares and votes can help us in nevaluating the support or acceptance that the web content has \nreceived.  \n \nIn the following, we discuss the influential factors designed or \nadopted for our model: \n \n\(1 comments and inlinks are the primary factors \nthat represent the influence exerted or attention received by a nblog post. We considered the comments and inlinks \nassociated with modern blog posts, such as Facebook likes nG +1’s, and sharing on social networking websites. In our \nmodel, in additional to using the number of traditional \ninlinks, we also use FBCount, which is the sum of facebook-\nlikes and facebook-shares, as our new influential factors. \nNote that this parameter is an indication of direct influence \nexerted by blogs, similar to the count of inlinks. Note that \nFBCount may be replaced by the count of twitter shares, G \n+1’s, hits, or the sum of all of these counts.  \n \n\(2 through \ncomments. Some people agree with the author’s ideas and \nsome disagree. We concur that it is important to identify and \ncapture the commenter’s attitude: positive, negative, or \nneutral [6], as the various attitudes are important to decide if \nthe blogger’s post is influential.  \n \n\(3 Commenters \nWhen we considered the activity generated by a blog post \n\(i.e., a “Post-Reply relationship” [6 there was important \nand valuable information embedded within it. The influence \nof each comment may have different impact power, \ndepending on who issues it. The comment might be from an \nexpert on the topic or a general blogger or a normal user. \nTheir comments on blog post should be treated differently, \nand it is easy to see how an expert’s comment would enhance \nthe influence of post more. We therefore adopt the influence nfactor of commenters [6] in our model. \n \n\(4 time plays a \nmajor role in the degree of influence [2], as the blog post that \nimpacted the public today may not have any influence after \ntwo months or even two days. Likewise, the time aspect of a \ncomment posted in responding to a post is also a significant \nfactor. \n \n\(5 important influential factor [1]. As \ndiscussed in Influence Flow Method [1], outlinks in a post \nindicate usage of other’s ideas to support his/her own idea, \nand thus they work against the novelty of the post [1 In \naddition to using outlinks, we propose a new factor, \nuniqueness, to represent novelty or originality of a post. By \nusing the TFIDF machine learning method, we determine the \nuniqueness of a post among all other posts in the database. \nWe believe that uniqueness is a way to determine the quality \nand usefulness of a post. \n \nNote that we do not consider the length of a post as an influential \nfactor because the length does not usually reflect the quality of a  \npost.  \n \n4.2 Proposed Influential Blogger Model \n \nIn this section we develop the proposed model in stages, \nincrementally in the influential factors considered. Table 3 lists \nthe terminologies used. \nTable 3: Notion Used in the Proposed Model \n \nSymbol Meaning \nIjt Blogger j’s Influence

So, \ngiven the set of comments to blog post Cji, for each comment x we \nfound the person who issued it and whether they agreed or ndisagreed with the blog post. We used this information to find the \ncomment score achieved by the blog post Also each comment is \nassociated with the time stamp which we used to keep up with the \ndynamic nature of the blog post. For a received set of comments \n????? ??? the comment score for ith post of blogger j is calculated as \nfollows: \n \n????? ??? ? ?? ? ?\n??????? ? ?????? ??\n?????? ? ? ?\n?\n? ? ????? ? ?\n?\n?\n?????\n?\n nwc is the weight parameter of comment factor whose value is 8. \n \nNovelty \(Uniqueness and Outlinks score of a blog post should reflect the usefulness and quality \nof the content. Novelty is one such parameter that is directly \nrelated to the blog post and can convey the quality of the content \npresent. So we included novelty in our scoring algorithm. Novelty \nis inversely proportional to the number of outlinks present in the npost [1].  \n \nTo measure the novelty it is useful to know how novel or original \nthe content is. To do this we built a word space that represented a \ngeneral space of ideas. In our approach we considered each blog npost as a separate document. We first removed all the stop words \nfrom the documents and then used the TFIDF weighing scheme to \nextract all the important keywords from the documents and create \nthe word space. After creating the word space we projected each \nblog post into the word space to estimate the degree of novelty.  \n nThe novelty for post i of blogger j is calculated as follows. \n??\n eq. 10 parameter and wo is the outlinks \nweight parameter whose values are 30 and 1/10, respectively. \n \nThe Influence Score \nFinally, the influence score for the each blog post was calculated \nas follows. The score for post i of blogger j is: \n \n eq. 11 calculating the post score PSji,p \(t index value at a \ngiven instance t, equal to Ijt, if and only if Ijt blog posts of blogger \nj received a score Ijt and remaining BP\(j discuss how the experiments were carried out \nand the results obtained. And then we compared our results nagainst the previous models.  \n \n5.1 Experiment Setup and Data Set \n \nFirst, we need blog post dataset with necessary fields and \nparameters. We requested the dataset from the authors of \n“Productive and Influential Bloggers” [3] and received a small \ndataset containing blog posts from the engadget web blog \ncommunity. The dataset we received contained all the necessary \nparameters including post title, author, postdate, post content, \ncomments, comment dates, inlinks and inlinks dates etc. Table 4 \nsummarizes the overall picture of the dataset we received from \nengadget web blog community. \n \nTable 4: Dataset statistics \n \n Engadget\nBloggers 93 \nPosts 63,358 \nInlinks 319,880 \nComments 3,672,819 \nComments per Post 57.97 \nInlinks per Post 5.05 \nPosts per Author 681.27 \nAverage Post Length \(words post for the additional \nparameters that were missing for our experiment including \nfblikes, twitter shares, G 1’s, etc. We considered the previous \nmodel “Productive and Influential bloggers [3]” as our prototype \nand introduced our parameters one after the other.  \n \nTo avoid the over fitting error problem, i.e., adding too many \nparameters into the model could have jeopardized the overall \nperformance of the system, the experiment was carried out in four \ndifferent stages: \nStage 1: We introduced the new influential factor \(Facebook nscore comments” \(i.e., “comment \nscore in the second half of the equation comments” technique \(eq. 9 


commenter-influence factors.  \nStage 3: We applied both the Facebook count and “mining \ncomments” techniques to the prototype model.  \nStage 4: Lastly, we incorporated our novelty parameter along with \nthe Facebook count and “mining comments” techniques into the \nprevious model to make our final model. \n \n5.2 Results \n \nTo evaluate the proposed model, we look at the individual blog \npost influential scores and their changes with each modification in \nstages. \n \nStage 1 \(FBCount Only affected \nthe influential scores between different blog posts.  \n \n23\nTable 5: Individual blog post scores when Facebook count is \nintroduced into model\n \n \nIn Table 5 columns Score_U & Score_V represent the productive \nand influence scores of posts according to “productive and \ninfluential bloggers” model, and PS_FB represents the influence \nscore of posts according to the resultant model when Facebook \ncount is introduced From left to right the columns in Table 5 \nrepresent post id, title, post author, comments received by post npostdate, inlinks received by post, post FBCount, etc. We took \nrandom blog posts posted on 03/22/2010 to monitor the changes \nwhen Facebook count was introduced. Since the date for all the \nblog posts was the same the influence scores of blog posts entirely \ndepended on other parameters: comments, inlinks, and Facebook ncount.  \n \nConsider the influence scores \(score_V, PS_FB both posts there was a subtle \ndifference between the number of comments and inlinks but blog \npost 11557 had a greater FBCount than the post 11890, which \nfavored the influence score of 11557. The influence score was nincreased in the resultant model as compared to the “productive \nand influential blogger” model. \nFigure 2 and Figure 3 depict cropped blog posts with Post IDs \n14890 and 11557, respectively. As shown in the figures we can \nsee the influential factors associated with the blog posts such as \nauthor name, date of post, number of comments, fblikes, and \nFacebook shares, etc. \nFigure 2: Cropped blog post \(ID 14890 factors. \n \nFigure 3: Cropped blog post \(ID 11557 the resultant model scored each blog \npost and defined an Influence index from the scores obtained. \nThis Influence index was used to rank the bloggers among other \nbloggers in the community. Table 6 depicts how the final ranking \nof the bloggers changed when Facebook count was introduced \ninto the model. In Table 6 BP indicates BP-index, BI indicates BI-\nindex of the blogger according to the “productive and influential nbloggers [3]” while I-FBCount indicates the Influence-index of \nblogger according to our model. BP-index is defined out of all \nscore_U\(measures how often the blogger produces lengthy \nposts influence, so we compared our \nresultant model with the BI-Index. BI-index is defined out of all \nscore_Vs which measures the influence of blog post. Similarly I-\nFBCount is defined out of all PS_FB of blogger. \n nTable 6: BI vs I-FBCount \n \n \nAs highlighted in Table 6 the resultant model ranked V Savov \nsecond and C Ziegler third. Similarly J Topolsky and P miller \nranks were interchanged and R Block and R Lai ranks were also \ninterchanged.  \n \n \n24\nStage 2 \(Mined Comments Only app\ncomments” method to the prototype model w\nscores of blog posts as following.

The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators.

Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload.

The study consists of a\nstakeholder analysis to identify the primary stakeholders and\ntheir needs, and the development of a computational tool to\nexplore the architectural tradespace.\nSeveral interviews have been conducted with experts at\nNASA to elicit the potential requirements on SCaN from\ndifferent user communities.\nThe major architectural decisions to be made by the SCaN\nprogram have been identified and encoded in a mathematical\nmodel. A computational tool has been developed that can\nautomatically enumerate and evaluate thousands of different\nSCaN architectures. This tool contains both a performance\nand a cost model.\nNext Steps\nThe next steps include calibration of the optical link budget\ncalculations, comparisons of the network scheduling calcula-\ntions with historical TDRSS load data, and validation of the\nspacecraft sizing algorithm with real TDRS data. Following\nthe completion of the stakeholder analysis, the tool will be\nbe used to explore the architectural tradespace and identify\na subset of preferred architectures worth studying in more\ndetail.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
