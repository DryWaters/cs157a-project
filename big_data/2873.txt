KIMAS 2003 BOSTON USA A Data Mining Based Algorithm for Traffic Network Flow Forecasting Xiaoyan Gong Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Sicence, Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, China gxylsh@hohnail.com Abstract  Recent development in ITS Intelligent Transportation Systems methods and technologies has moved traffic operating systems from passive to pro active control and management where real-time and accurate trafic flow information is 
critical to actual implementation So far many algorithms have been proposed for traffic network flow forecasting but problems in accuracy and timeliness still remain to be the major obstacle for their successful applications For example presumed human travel habit and vehicle tuming probabilities at intersections have greatly limited the use of dynamic assignment algorithm In order to improve the forecasting and real-time responsiveness, a new algorithm based on data mining which can do association des 
mining and association analysis is proposed here for predicting traffic network flow Simulation results using Corsim 5.0 have demonstrated effectiveness of the new algorithm in both accuracy and timeliness Keywords ITS Traffic Network Forecasting Dynamic Assignment Algorithm Data Mining Association Analysis; Association Rules Mining 1 Introduction With development of ITS Intelligent Transportation Systems it is now changing gradually from passive responding system to active behavior system which highly depends on 
precise and real-time traffic network flow forecasting and single point flow forecasting Xiaoyan Gong 2001 So far most of research attention is mainly put into single point flow forecasting while little in network flow forecasting Dynamic traffic assignment is the main previous approache for traffic network flow forecasting M Papageorgiou,l990 But because it needs OD matrix prediction and some presumptions such as vehicle turning probability of each intersection and people\222s route selection methods it cannot give accurate traffic condition prediction especially when accidents occurs somewhere because it just

Although several advanced algorithms Zhaosheng Yang 2000 such as dynamic traffic assignment model based on genetic algorithm is proposed it still cannot meet real time system requirements Since dynamic traffic assignment considers little accidental factors then NPR Non-Parametric Regression algorithm [Karlsson and Yakowitz 19871 a kind of data mining approaches can be used for each link flow forecasting in trailic network because it needs no mathematical modelling and thus no data loss that is to say accidental factors has been concemed in NPR In essence the approach locates the state of the system defined by 
the independent variables in a 221neighbourhood\222 of past similar states Once this neighbourhood has been established the past cases in the neighbourhood are used to estimate the value of the dependent variable Recent researches Davis and Nihan    Gong 20021 have shown nonparametric regression to hold high potential to accurately forecast short-term traffic flows But if each link of traffic network adopts NPR then it cannot assure real-time ability although with high accuracy So some measures must be taken to increasing its real-time ability and in this paper a 
kind of system dimension decreasing method based on data mining is given So in this paper a new traffic network forecasting approaches based on data mining is addressed in order to realize predict veracity real-time ability and practicability In section 2 scheme of the whole traffic network algorithm is given and then sections from 3 to 5 present each step of the new algorithm in detail with a simulation example by Corsim5.O In section 6 simulation test result is analyzed, and in the last section some problems and comments are discussed 243 


KIMAS 2003 BOSTON USA 2 Traffic Network Flow Forecasting Scheme Scheme of the traffic network flow forecasting algorithm is shown in Fig 1 There are five steps in this algorithm 1 The whole traffic network is divided into some sub-networks through association analysis among adjacent links in the network 2 In each sub-network, association analysis among adjacent links is used to locate key link which has great relativity with other links 3 In each sub-network association rules mining algorithm is adopted to get association rules between key link and other links 4 Put all the key links of the whole network into a vector NPR algorithm is used to predict traffic flow values of all the key links in the network 5 With rules from step 3 deduce predict flow values of other links in each sub-network from its key link\222s predict flow value 3 Sub-networks Formation and Dete rmination of Key Links Based on Association Analysis The whole traffic network is divided into some sub networks through association analysis with equation 1 2 1 a   y3 1 m I r s.s J2  I2 U  n2 I I Here y  I x2  1 is traffic flow vector including whole day average flow with period of 5 minutes of link Lx  and y  cy y  y 1 is traffic flow vector of adjacent link Ly Y 7 are arithmetic average value of X and Y respectively Here an example by Corsim 5.0 is shown in Fig 2 in which there is a loop highway network which is divided into eight links from L to L  and correlation coefficients through association analysis between each of two consecutively adjacent links is shown in Fig 3 The first point stands for the correlation coefficients between link L and link L  and second point for the correlation coefficients between link L and link L  and so do others. From Fig 3 some gaps can find in the curves and they can become boundaries for division of traffic network Therefore, three sub networks are made L with low correlation coefficients with L and L becomes a single sub network SI  L  L  L and L  constitute a sub network sz  and L  L and L  constitute the last sub network S\222  1 0.98 0.96 0.94 0.92 0.9 0 88 LILZ L2LI LIL L,Lr LSLS LeL L,Ls LaL Fig .3 Correlation Coefficients between Adjacent Links 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 1 L1 L2 L Ls I Fig 4 Correlation Coefficients Distribution Then key links in each sub-network should he determined with the same method In the first sub network SI since it includes only one link L  then L becomes its key link Slk In the second sub network S2 which includes L  L  L and L  association analysis is used again Fig 4 shows correlation coefficients between L and L  L  L respectively L and L  L  L respectively  L and L  L  L respectively, and L and L  L  L respectively After summing up these correlation coefficients groups L with biggest correlation coefficient becomes key link S\222k of this sub network With same method L becomes key link S\222k of sub networks\222  4 Associasion rules mining among key links and other links in sub-networks Association rules mining algorithm is first proposed by Agrawal in 1993\(Agrawal 1993 and often used in commercial data analysis especially in supermarket commodity management Through association rule 244

to the nasty DOS attacks we did not aggregate all the connection records into a single training data set Instead we extracted all the connection records that fall within a surrounding time window of plus and minus 5 minutes of the whole duration of each attack to create a data set for each attack type We also randomly extracted sequences of normal connections records to create the normal data set 5.2.1 Manual and Automatic Feature Construction Following the feature construction approach described in Section 4 for each attack type e.g syn 003ood port-scan etc we performed pattern mining and comparison using its intrusion data set and the normal data set We constructed appropriate features according to the intrusion only patterns Here we summarize the temporal and statistical features automatically constructed by our system 017 The 223 same host 224 feature that examine only the connections in the past 2 seconds that have the same destination host as the current connection 226 the count of such connections the percentage of connections that have the same service as the current one the percentage of different services the percentage of the S0 003ag and the percentage of the REJ i.e rejected connection 003ag 017 The 223same service\224 features that examine only the connections in the past 2 seconds that have the same service as the current connection 226 the count of such connections the percentage of different destination hosts the percentage of the S0 003ag and the percentage of the REJ 003ag We call these the time-based 223traf\002c\224 features for connection records There are several 223slow\224 PROBING attacks that scan the hosts or ports using a much larger time interval than 2 seconds for example one in every minute As a result these attacks did not produce intrusion only patterns with the time window of 2 seconds We sorted these connection records by the destination hosts and applied the same pattern mining and feature construction process In stead of using a time window of 2 seconds we now used a 223connection\224 window of 100 connections and constructed a mirror set of 223host-based traf\002c\224 features as the timebased 223traf\002c\224 features We discovered that unlike most of the DOS and PROBING attacks the R2L and U2R attacks don't have any 223intrusion only\224 frequent patterns This is because most of the DOS and PROBING attacks involve sending a lot of connections to some host\(s in a very short period of time and therefore can have frequent sequential patterns that are different from the normal traf\002c The R2L and U2R attacks are embedded in the data portions of the packets and normally involve only a single connection Therefore it is unlikely that they can have any unique frequent traf\002c patterns In other words our automatic feature construction process failed to produce any features for these attacks After studying the outcome of this mining process we focussed our attention to the content of the connections In the Bro event handlers we added functions that inspect data exchanges of interactive TCP connections e.g telnet ftp smtp etc These functions assign values to a set of 223content\224 features to indicate whether the data contents suggest suspicious behavior These features are number of failed logins successfully logged in or not whether logged in as root whether a root shell is obtained whether a su command is attempted and succeeded number of access to access control 002les e.g 223/etc/passwd\224 223.rhosts\224 number of compromised states on the destination host e.g 002le/path 223not found\224 errors and 223Jump to\224 instructions etc number of hot indicators e.g access to system directories creation and execution of programs etc and number of outbound connections during a ftp session Our approach here is to include an extensive set of indicators and then let classi\002cation programs decide which minimal set of discriminating features should be used to identify intrusions 5.2.2 Detection Models It is evident that different categories of intrusions require different sets of constructed features in order to be detected We therefore built classi\002cation models using different feature sets 017 The 223traf\002c\224 model each connection record contains the 223intrinsic\224 and the 223traf\002c\224 features Table 7 shows some example labeled connection records The resultant RIPPER classi\002er detects the DOS and PROBING attacks Table 8 shows some example RIPPER rules 017 The host-based 223traf\002c\224 model each connection record contains the 223intrinsic\224 and the host-based 223traf\002c\224 features The resultant RIPPER classi\002ers detect the slow PROBING attacks 017 The 223content\224 model each connection record contains the 223intrinsic\224 and the 223content\224 features Table 1 shows some example labeled connection records The resultant RIPPER classi\002er detects the R2L and U2R attacks Table 2 shows some example RIPPER rules These classi\002cation models each specialize to a certain type of intrusion We then constructed a meta-level classi\002er to combine these detection models Each meta-level training record consists of four features the three predictions each from one of the base models plus the true class label i.e 223normal\224 and an attack type RIPPER was then 8

Although our models were intended for misuse detection we had hoped that the features we constructed would be general enough so that the models can detect new variations of the known intrusions Table 10 compares the detection rates of old intrusions and new intrusions Here new intrusions refer to those that did not have corresponding instances in the training data We see that our models were able to detect a large percentage of new PROBING and U2R attacks but not as effective for new DOS and R2L attacks 5.2.4 Discussion PROBING attacks have relatively limited variance because they all involve making connections to a large number of hosts or ports in a given time frame Likewise the outcome of all U2R attacks is that a root shell is obtained without legitimate means e.g login as root su to root etc Thus for these two categories of attacks given some representative instances in the training data our data mining system was able to construct features that capture their general behavior patterns As a result our detection models can detect a high percentage of old and new PROBING and U2R attacks On the other hand DOS and R2L have a wide variety of behavior because they exploit the weaknesses of a large number of different network or system services The features constructed based on the available attack instances are very specialized to the known attack types Our detection models therefore missed a large number of new DOS and R2L attacks The results here are not entirely surprising since our models are misuse detection models We need to use anomaly detection models on network traf\002c or system programs to guard against the new and diversi\002ed attacks Anomaly detection is much more challenging than misuse detection For example we need to 002rst decide whether we should build normal pro\002le for each network service or a group of services and for each host or a groups of hosts The feature construction process will likely to be more complex since unlike a relatively small number of 223intrusion only\224 patterns normal network traf\002c can have a large number of variations Network anomaly detection is an important problem and an active area of research 5.3 User Anomaly Detection 223Insiders\224 misusing their privileges can be hard to detect since they don't normally need to break-in and IDSs and security personnel tend to focus on guarding outside attacks Insider problems are some of the most vexing problems for security personnel Indeed who checks the checkers i.e the person to whom the IDS reports It is often very dif\002cult to classify a single event by a user as normal or abnormal because the unpredictable nature of most people A user's actions during a login session needs to be studied as a whole to determine whether he or she is behaving normally Our initial exploratory approach is to mine the frequent patterns from user command data and merge or add the patterns into an aggregate set to form the normal usage pro\002le of a user A new pattern can be merged with an old pattern if they have the same left-hand-sides and right-hand-sides their support values are within a 5 of each other and their con\002dence values are also within 5 of each other To analyze a user login session we mine the frequent patterns from the sequence of commands during this session This new pattern set is compared with the pro\002le pattern set and a similarity score is assigned Assume that the new set has n patterns and among them there are m patterns that have 223matches\224 i.e rules that they can be merged with in the pro\002le pattern set then the similarity score is simply m n  Obviously a higher similarity score means a higher likelihood that the user's behavior agrees with his or her historical pro\002le User Normal Activities sysadm logs in as root cats the password 002le and runs commands such as top programmer1 writes public domain C code use a vi editor compiles the C code reads and sends mail and executes unix commands programmer2 a similar user pro\002le but works in afternoons and evenings secretary edits latex 002les runs latex reads mail and sends mail manager1 reads and sends mail

anomaly analysis Note that since we were the only group that performed anomaly detection on the test data Lincoln Labs did not evaluate our results We report our experiments on the training data here We apply our frequent episode algorithms to the command data from each login session of the same user with command as the axis feature and w 5 i.e we look for patterns within the range of 5 consecutive commands to mine the frequent sequential patterns on the associations among user commands their arguments time segments and hosts We treat the 002rst 4 weeks as a data gathering period during which we simply merge the patterns into each user's pro\002les Each user has 3 pro\002les one for the ac11

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
