Mining Positive and Negat ive Sequential Patterns with Multiple Minimum Supports in Large Transaction Databases  Weimin Ouyang, Qinhua Huang Modern Education Technology Center Shanghai University of Political Science and La 000Z  Shanghai 201701, China oywm,hqh}@shupl.edu.cn   Abstract Sequential patterns mining is an important research topic in data mining and knowledge discovery. The objective of mining sequential patterns is to find out frequent sequences based on the user-specified minimum support threshold, which implicitly assumes that all items in the data have similar 
frequencies. This is often not the case in real-life applications If the frequencies of items vary a great deal, we will encounter the dilemma called the rare item problem. In this paper, an efficient algorithm to discover sequential patterns with multiple minimum supports is proposed. The algorithm can not only discover sequential patterns forming between frequent sequences, but also discover sequential patterns forming between either frequent and sequences rare sequences or among rare sequences. Moreover, an algorithm for mining positive and negative sequential patterns with multiple minimum supports is designed simultaneously 
Keywords- multiple supports ;data mining; sequential patterns I  I NTRODUCTION  Sequential patterns mining is an important research topic in data mining and knowledge discovery, which is firstly proposed by R.Agrawal [1 W h i l e  a ssoc i a t i o n r u l e s m i ni n g  is to find the intra-transaction relations, sequential patterns mining is to find the inter-transactions relations. A sequential pattern is formed as \(A, B\, where A and B are disjoint item sets, and its support is no less than a user-specified minimum support Inspired by the idea of negative association rules [2  3   we set forth the concept of negative sequential patterns. For 
instance, if one buys Linux operating system software, then he would not buy application software based on MSWindows. The negative sequential pattern can be formed as A  B\ which means that if A is in a transaction, then B would not in another transaction with high probability. There are other forms negative sequential patterns likes  A, B and  A  B The user-specified minimum support threshold is a key element of mining sequential patterns, which is used to prune the search space and to limit the number of rules generated 
Using only a single minimum support implicitly assumes that all items in the data have similar frequencies in the database. This is often not the case in real-life applications In many applications, some items appear frequently in the data, while others appear rarely. If the frequencies of items vary a great deal, we will encounter the dilemma called as the rare item problem. If minsup is set too high, we will not find those sequential patterns that involve rare items in the data. If minsup is set too low in order to find sequential patterns that involve both frequent and rare items, it will cause combinatorial explosion because those frequent items 
will be associated with one another in all possible ways and many of them are meaningless In order to deal with the rare item problem, we put forward a multiple minimum supports based model for mining sequential pattern. In this model, we can specify a different minimum item support for each item, which is calculated for each item based on a monotonous decreasing power function such as x 1 of its support Consequently, the difference between the minimum item support for each item and its support will vary in an expected way. For the frequent items, the difference is small; for the 
rare items, the difference is large. Thus, the minimum item support for frequent item is slightly less than its support, and the minimum item support for rare item is much lower than its support. The number of frequent itemsets will not explode; the rare itemsets will not be missed In this paper, we combine these two extensions to propose a novel approach to mining both positive and negative sequential patterns with multiple minimum supports The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The definitions for positive and negative sequential patterns with multiple minimum supports are given in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the discovery algorithm for mining 
positive and negative sequential patterns with multiple minimum supports. Section 4 presents our primary experimental results. The conclusions are made in the last section II  P ROBLEM D EFINITION  A  Sequential Patterns  Let I = {i 1 i 2 i m be a set of literals called items.

where each transaction is a subset of I. A non-empty subset of I is called itemset. An itemset containing k items is called k-itemste. The support of an itemset X denoted as sup\(X\ is defined as the number of transactions containing X in D. An itemset is frequent if its support is greater than a userspecified threshold minsup A sequence is an ordered list of itemsets such as s = \(s 1  s 2 s u where each itemset s i is an element of the sequence. An item can appear only once in an element, but can occur multiple times in different elements of a sequence Items in an element are assumed to be sorted in lexicographic order. A sequence with k items where 000  j j s k   is called a k-sequence,where | s j  denotes the number of items in itemset s j  A sequence t = \(t 1 t 2 t v is called a subsequence of s if there exist integer 1 002 j 1 j 2 j v 002 u such that 1 1 j s t 003  2 2 j s t 003  v j v s t 003 A sequence database SD is a set of tuple <sid,t>, where sid is the sequence identifier and t is a sequence. A tuple <sid,t> is said to contain a sequence s if s is a subsequence of t. The support of a sequence s, sup\(s\is defined as the number of tuples in the sequence database SD containing sequence s. A sequence is frequent if the support of the sequence is no less than the predefined minimum support threshold minsup. The maximally large sequences are called as sequential patterns The algorithm proposed by Agrawal and Srikant to mine sequential patterns from large transaction databases is divided into five phases   002 1 002 Sort phase. The transaction database is sorted by customer ID as the major key and transaction time as the minor key. The phase converts the original transaction database into a database of customer sequences; \(2\Large itemset phase. The set of all the large itemsets are found from the customer sequences database by the similar method with the process of mining association rules. Note that the counting of itemset is for customer sequence not for transaction. When an itemset occurs more than one time in a customer sequence, it is counted just once for this customer sequence. \(3\Transformation phase. In this phase, each large itemset is mapped to a contiguous integer and the original customer sequences are transformed into the mapped integer sequences. \(4\ Sequence phase. The set of transformed integer sequences are used to find large sequences among them. \(5\Maximum phase. The maximally large sequences are derived and output to users B  Negative Sequential Patterns Corresponding to a positive sequential pattern such as \(A B\, there are three possible negative sequential patterns, \(A  B  A, B\ and  A  B\. For a sequence \(A  B\ and a certain transaction sequence CS, if A 003 CS and  B 004 CS we say that CS supports \(A  B\. Assume there is a negative sequential pattern such as \({i 1   i 2 i 3 which means that if i 1 is in a customer sequence CS, i 2 and i 3 would not appeared in the customer sequence CS, but there is a possibility that one of the i 2 and i 3 is in this customer sequence To discover negative sequential pattern, we need to consider all of the possible sequence in transaction databases. If \(A  B\a negative sequential pattern, it will hold that sup\(A  B\ >= minsup. A higher value for minsup possibly means sup\(A,B\<minsup, i.e., \(A, B\ is infrequent sequence. However, there are too many infrequent sequences in database. If A is a frequent itemset while B is a infrequent itemset with support 1, we will have: sup\(A\>=minsup sup\(B 005 0, sup\(A  B 005 sup\(A\>=minsup. Therefore, it seems that \(A  B\ is a negative sequential pattern. In fact this kind of sequences is rather prevalent in real database, for example, a set of the goods rarely bought by customers in supermarket is an infrequent itemset. In practice, since the task of data mining is to find all kinds of valuable correlations, we usually more focus on the correlations between the well-sold goods, which are based on the frequent sequence. In other word, if \(A  B  A, B\ and   A  B\ are negative sequential patterns, A and B would be frequent sequence. In generally speaking, we only focus on the frequent sequence whether the sequential patterns are positive or negative In order to find valuable association rules, PiatetskyShapiro had put forward an interestingness measurement of association rules [4  If  s u p  X 001 Y 005 sup\(X  sup\(Y\, X 000 Y is considered as uninteresting rules. In other words, we can say that as the association rule X 000 Y is interesting only if sup\(X 001 Y  sup\(X  sup\(Y\ is no less than a specified minimum interesting value, mininterest. Similarly, we adopt the same method to measure the interesting of negative sequential patterns We formally define an interesting negative sequential pattern \(A  B\ as 000\035  1 001 B 006  2\ sup\(A\>=minsup, sup\(B\>=minsup, sup\(A 001  B minsup 3\up\(A 001  B  sup\(A  sup  B\>= mininterest Noted it need to satisfy condition sup\(B\>=minsup since we are only interested in frequent itemset in sequential patterns By the same way we can define conditions of negative sequential patterns forms as  A, B\ and  A  B If \(A  B\ is a negative sequential pattern, A 001 B will be an interesting infrequent sequence. If i is an interesting infrequent itemset, there exists at least one expression, i=A 001 B, which makes one of \(A  B  A, B\ and  A  B be interesting negative sequential pattern hold C  Multiple minimum supports In multiple minimum supports model, every item i j of the itemset I={i 1 i 2 i m has been assigned a minimum item support based on its support value sup\(i j noted as mis\(i j  Definition 1 the minimum item support of an item i j is defined as  otherwise  LS   m\(i  if      j 000 000 000   LS i m i mis j j

The algorithm generates frequent sequences by making multiple passes over the data set. However, in contrary to single minsup approaches which follow downward closure property \(all the subsets of a frequent sequence are frequent\, multiple minimum support approaches follow sorted closure property.

Fig. 4  Gene expression maps and curves of the 2 genes with the itemset3 of gene functions 3.3 Examining interesting clusters Table 1 shows that there are 38 to 55 significant clusters with respect to different gene ontology category. Here we looked closely into several selected clusters. The clusters are selected based on the corresponding average gene expression, which conceal interesting clues to biologists. We selected the 36 th significant cluster with respect to Cellular Component because this cluster has an interesting pattern in the gene expression maps consistent to the anatomical boundaries. As Fig. 5 shows, there are 37 genes in this cluster, and most genes have a clear curve with high gene expression in the middle of the brain Fig. 5  Genes in the 36 th cluster of Cellular Component In this cluster, frequent itemsets of all sizes of gene functions were considered. Table 5 shows parts of gene maps of the genes having the functions of the frequent itemsets. The genes with same itemsets also show similar or opposite images. The full results of examining several other clusters are available at http://denlab.temple.edu/repository/examining_clusters pdf Table 5.

Discussion Although the techniques of association rule mining have been applied to gene expression data analysis, not much effort has focused on detecting the relation between gene expression maps in mice brains and related gene functions. By using the proposed methods to mine association rules among gene functions in the significant clusters of gene expression maps, a number of frequent itemsets of gene functions can be obtained  By inspecting certain clusters and specific genes which have the functions of the frequent itemsets, interesting clues might be obtained for the biological scientists The genes which include the frequent itemsets not only have the same set of gene functions with each other but also have very similar gene expression maps because the rules are mined from significant clusters of genes we have previously obtained. These frequent itemsets of gene functions are correlated to the average images of gene expression maps of their corresponding clusters   


The association rules we have detected make sense biologically, and provide valuable insight to biologists For instance, the genes of the 36 th cluster with respect to cellular component are strongly expressed in the corpus callosum, the major body of white matter in the brain. Perhaps it is not surprising then, that these clusters have many genes involved in myelin biogenesis and fatty acid biosynthesis. It is interesting that one of the genes in the 17 th cluster of molecular function is involved in selenium metabolism suggesting a role for selenium in white matter synthesis. Genes in the 26 th cluster of biological process are largely expressed in the hypothalamus, an area with many nuclei and hence rich in nerve terminals. Consistent with this, the cluster has many genes involved in protein transport. The interpretation of the remaining of significant itemsets will be reported in a future paper In our future work, we will further explore the algorithms and techniques to mine the gene expression maps based on the significant clusters. Since our proposed approach of association rule mining of gene functions is, so far, based on determining the same GO terms \(gene functions\, we can extend the method by using the similarity values of pairs of gene functions in the GO structure. This means that if two functions are very similar to each other or one is a parent of the other even though they have different GO ID, we can consider the two functions as being the same. So the rules can possibly be merged into more general rules without loosing relevant information. We will try different algorithms of association rule mining and propose the most suitable methods to fit our data. We also plan to add other features besides the gene functions, such as the label of significant cluster or the wavelet features extracted from the gene maps. Most importantly, one can predict gene functions by the association rules we found in the significant clusters This is due to the fact that the particular patterns of gene expression maps have high probability to have similar gene functions to the detected frequent itemsets Acknowledgements     This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants IIS-0705215 IIS-0237921 and by the National Institutes of Health under grant R01 MH68066-04 funded by NIMH NINDS and NIA, NINDS grant 1 R01 NS050148, and also by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health \(NIH\, National Library of Medicine \(NLM\.
