Discovery of Interesting Association Rules from Livelink Web Log Data Xiangji Huang School of Computer Science University of Waterloo Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1 Canada jhuang@cs.uwaterloo.ca Nick Cercone Faculty of Computer Science Dalhousie University Halifax Nova Scotia B3H 1W5 Canada Abstract We present our experience in mining web rrsagepotrerns from a large collection of Livelink log dura Livelink is a web-based product of Open Text which provides automatic 
management arid retrieval of drfferenr pes of information objects over an inrranet or extranet We report our experi ence in preprocessing raw log datu andposr-processing the mining results for finding interesting rules In panicular we compare and evaluare a number of rule interestingness measures andfind that two of the measures that have not been used in association rule learning work very well 1 Introduction The use of internet technology permits organizations to generate and collect large volumes of electronic 
data in their daily operations open Text\222s Livelink is a web-based prod uct that is designed to facilitate the storage sharing and management of critical information and processes for an organization We describe two challenges that we faced in mining Livelink usage patterns from a large volume of unique Livelink log files The first challenge is preprwess ing the raw log data to extract information that is relevant to our task We present our techniques for preprocessing the log data. In particular we describe the 
need for identifying information objects from log entries and methods for iden tifying users and sessions from the logs The second chal lenge we faced is filtering the mining results to present rules or patterns that are potentially interesting To find interest ing rules we use seven interestingness measures to rank the generated association rules two of which have not previ ously been used to evaluate association rules Pruning tech niques are also applied to eliminate rules that are considered 763 Aijun An Department of Computer Science

the $-coefficient that describes the corre lation between the antecedent and consequent of a rule 2 Livelink Log Files The log files used in our experiments contain Livelink access data for a period of two months The size of the data is 7GB The data describe more than 3,000,000 requests made to a Livelink server from around 5,000 users Each request corresponds to an entry in the log files The entry contains I the 
IP address the user is making the request from 2 the cookie generated by the Livelink server on the user\222s machine 3 the time the request is made and the time the required page is presented to the user 4 the name of the request handler in the Livelink program 5 the name of the method within the handler that is used to handle the request 6 the query strings that can he used to identify the page and the objects 
being requested and some other information that are irrelevant to our task, such as the URL addresses that are useful for error-handling 3 Data Preprocessing The objective of data preprocessing is to transform the raw log data into the data that can be used for learning pat terns The following tasks are performed in the data pre processing step of our project identifying the user from each entry of the log files identifying the information ob jects that the user requests from each log entry, removing 


noisy entries which are the entries in which no interesting objects are requested, and finally grouping entries into ses sions We use IP addresses to identify users of Livelink Even though the same user can log into Livelink through different IP addresses the chance for this to happen is con sidered to be smaller than the chance that cookies are dis abled because in almost all the time a user accessesLivelink from the desktop in hisiber office Therefore instead of us ing cookies to identify users IP addresses are used The unique part of data processing in our project is object iden tification In previous works on web usage mining it is the pages that were identified from log entries At the begin ning of this project we identified all the pages involved in the log files Because almost all of the pages in Livelink are dynamic, the number of such pages is huge However the problem is not in the number of pages but in the useful ness of dynamic pages When we analyzed the discovered patterns that describe access relationships among pages we found that many of those patterns reveal the program pat ferns within Livelink. For example two pages are found to he always accessed together because one is the frame within the other, which is defined by the Livelink program. These patterns are not considered to be interesting by our domain experts In addition there could be great sirnilxities in the contents of different dynamic pages Two dynamic pages may he considered to be different pages even though they contain the same set of information objects In order to discover truly interesting and unexpected patterns we con ducted object identification from each dynamic page and build the session file based on the objects An object could be a document \(such as a PDF file a project description, a task description anews group message a picture and so on Different types of objects have different domains of identi ties Based on the domain knowledge about Livelink. iden tities of the objects being requested can be extracted from the parameters in the query string of the log entry Most entries contain only one object but some entries have zero or more than one object We ignore all the entries with no information object After objects are identified we group the requests made by each user into sessions In our case a session consists of a sequence of sets of objects requested by a ingle user such that no two consecutive requesb are separated by an interval more than a predefined threshold In our experiments the threshold is set to be IO minutes 4 Learning Interesting Association Rules We implemented the Apriori algorithm I to learn as sociation rules from the session file An association rule describes the association relationship between information objects For example an association rule 01 02 u3 t os suppmt  0.01 cvnfidence  0.61 we identified nearly 200.0W pages from the rwrrrnonth daa means that 1  of the sessions contain objects 01 02 u3 04 and 05 and that 60 of the sessions containing 01 02 and u3 also contain 04 and 05 The number of discovered asso ciation rules depends on the support and coiifidence thresh olds On our data set we found that the number of gener ated rule is not affected much by changing the confidence threshold However the number of rules greatly depends on the support threshold At low support regions a very small change in support threshold can lead to a super expo nential growth in the number of rules Table I shows how the number of rules varies with the support threshold given a confidence threshold To avoid missing interesting rules or generating too many rules, we set the support and confi dence thresholds to be 0.0028 and 0.5 respectively in our later experiments The number of rules generated under this setting is 4556 Although 4556 is much less than 74,565 which is the number of rules for the support threshold of 0.0025 there are still tm many rules and not all ofthem are interesting Therefore we are facing both the rule quantify and rule quality problems To solve the problems we rank the rules according to some interestingness measures and prune the rules according to both structural relationships of the rules and their degrees of interestingness 4.1 Interestingness Measures The goal of data mining is to find patterns that are inter esting and relevant to the task at hand Various interesting ness measures have been proposed They generally fall into two categories objective and subjective SI Objective mea sures are statistical measures whose values are calculated based on the data used in the mining process Examples of objective measures include RI 6 and IS 9 Subjective measures can be defined according to the unexpectedness and actionability of the discovered patterns 8 A rule is unexpected if it is surprising to the data analyst and ac tionable if the analyst can act on it to hisiber advantage In our experiments, we use both objective and subjective mea sures. Seven statistical measures are used as objective mea sures to rank the generated rules Subjective measures that measure the unexpectedness and actionability of rules are used to verify the top-ranking rules produced by the objec tive measures Our objective of using subjective measures is to determine which objective measures are best suitable for our application Given an association rule A  B we use the following objective measures to the measure the in terestingness of the rule 1 Support and confidence SC Rules are ranked accord ing to their support value as the main key and their confidence value as the secondary key 2 Confidence and support CS Rules are ranked accord ing to their confidence value as the main key and their support value as the secondary key 764

These top-ranking rules were presented to our domain expert who evaluated these rules according to the unexpectedness and actionability of the rules Based on his feedback we classify these rules into interesting \(marked with  and uninteresting marked with  rules We can observe from the table that IS MD and C2 produce sim ilar topranking rules and that the top-ranking rules from SC RI and CV are also similar The top ranking from CS is different from others We also observe that MD and C2 work the best on the data set IS is also a good measure However SC CS RI and CV either fail to identify any or identify only one interesting rule in their top IO lists 765

search can be started Provided the core structure is specific enough, there are only few at best only one embedding per molecule so that the list of embeddings is short While it is trivial to embed a single atom into a molecule embedding a core structure can be much more difficult In our implementation we rely on the following simple obser vation Embedding a core structure is the same as finding a common substructure of the molecule and the core that is as big as the core itself This leads to the idea to grow a sub structure into both the core and the molecule until it com pletely covers the core. That is we do a substructure search for the core and the molecule starting from an arbitrary atom of the core and requiring a support of 100 i.e both the core and the molecule must contain the substructure In addition, we can restrict the search to one embedding of a substructure into the core at all times since we know that it must he completely covered in the end For the molecule however we must consider all possible embeddings Note that the same mechanism of growing a substructure into two molecules can also be used for substructure tests as they are needed to suppress multiple reporting of the same fragment see above as well as reporting redundant frag ments fragments that are substructures of some other frag ment and have the same support as this fragment 2.7 Finding Contrast Structures Our approach to find frequent substructures can easily be extended to find contrasf sfrucfures that is substructures that are frequent in a predefined subset of the molecules and infrequent in the complement of this subset Finding con trast structures requires two parameters a minimum sup prt for the focus subset and a maximum support for the complement The search is carried out in exactly the same way as described above The only difference is that two support numbers are determined one for the focus subset and one for the complement Only the support in the focus subset is used to prune the search tree The support in the complement determines whether a frequent substructure is recorded or not thus filtering out those substructures that do not satisfy the requirements for a contrast structure 3 Experimental Results We applied the presented approach to a number of confi dential data sets with substantial success In order to be able to report results in more detail we used a well-known publicly available dataset from the National Cancer Insti tute the DTP AIDS Antiviral Screen dataset This screen utilized a soluble formazan assay to measure protection of human CEM cells from HIV-1 infection Full details were published in I I Compounds able to provide at least 50 protection to the CEM cells were retested Compounds that provided at least 50 protection on retest were listed as moderately active CM Compounds that reproducibly Atom C Carbon 0 Oxygen N Nitroeen CA CM and CI 325 100.0 36828 99.95 311 95.7 33029 89.64 276  84.9 29234 \(79.34 224  S Sulfur 11 143 44.0 I 10926 29.65   I1 I Se Selenium 11 6  1.9 1 132 0.36 Table I Some single-atom fragments occurring in molecules of the HIV database, together with their Occurrence frequencies provided 100 protection were listed as confirmed active CA\Compounds not meeting these criteria were listed as confirmed inactive CI Available online 8 are screening results and chemical structural data on compounds that are not covered by a confidentiality agreement Available are 41,316 compounds of which we used 37,171 Out of these a total of 325 belongs to class CA 877 are of class CM and the remaining 35,969 are of class CI NCI lists 75 known active compounds which are grouped into seven classes I Azido Pyrimidines 2 Natural Prod ucts or Antibiotics 3 Benzodiazepines, Thiazolobenzim idazoles and related Compounds 4 Pyrimidine Nucleo sides 5 Dyes and Polyanions 6 Heavy Metal Com pounds. and 7 Purine Nucleosides As described above, our molecular fragment mining al gorithm requires a seed fragment which may be empty For the HIV dataset an empty core results in numerous em beddings of trivial fragments such as single carbon atoms or small combinations of carbon atoms only However fragments of interest contain at least one non-carbon atom which enabled us to seed the algorithm using the remaining atoms The list of atoms can be obtained through various methods We simply started from an empty core restricted the fragment size to one atom, and ran our molecular frag ment miner. Parts of the resulting list of atoms together with their occurrence frequencies are listed in Table I Obviously due to space constraints we cannot report in detail about seeding the algorithm with each of these atoms In the following we therefore concentrate on a few exper iments to demonstrate how the proposed method picks out relevant fragments in some of these groups 3.1 Nitrogen based Fragments First we focus on compounds containing a nitrogen atom We used a minimum support of 15.0 for compounds of class CA and a maximum support of 0.1 for the comple ment\222 classes CM and CI 171 fragments were generated 3Thresholds were selected %p-down\224 i.e starting with large rellings that quickly resulted in no reponed fragmens the thresholds were subne quentially lowered until a small number of fragments was reponed 56

single bond  aromatic bond single bOnd  aromatic bDnd d CBO Figure 9 Two fragments extracted from a sei of steroids On the left, single and aromatic bonds were treated as different bond types. on the right they were treated as the same bond type 3.4 Treatment of Aromatic Bonds An important aspect of molecular fragment mining is the treatment of aromatic rings Since ammaticity is not clearly defined and can be modeled differently i.e explicit aro matic bonds vs alternating single and double bonds it is desirable to be able to take it into account throughout the mining process itself We achieve this by modeling aro matic bonds as either single or double bonds with a flag that indicates aromaticity This allows us to choose to ignore this flag during mining and hence to find fragments that contain either aromatic or single resp double bonds The following example illustrates why this is desirable Using a small set of steroid compounds we derived frag ments that occur in ail of them support=100%\using the standard algorithm Figure 9 left shows the correspond ing fragment Note how only two rings with an incomplete third ring are discovered of the four ring structure that is typical for steroids However if we model aromatic bonds as single+flag and allow the algorithm to ignore this flag the resulting fragment contains all four rings see Figure 9 right For some steroids this fourth ring consists of sin gle bonds while others have an aromatic ring at this posi tion However most chemists still regard this as the same 4 ring structure Such selective 223tolerance\224 against some mis matches can therefore make the presented algorithm more useful for real applications 4 Conclusions We presented an algorithm to find relevant molecular frag ments in large chemical structure databases The algorithm allows us to focus on fragments that help to discriminate be tween different classes of molecules The underlying search method, which is based on a depth first search with struc tural pruning makes it possible to find such fragments effi ciently without the need for frequent reembeddings of frag ment candidates, which is a known problem of previously reponed approaches We have shown how the proposed method finds relevant fragments using data from a well known HIV-screening compound database The extracted fragments successfully model several of the activity classes known for this dataset Future work will focus on making the presented approach more meaningful for the underlying application In partic ular finding fragments that match exactly is not of prime interest to chemists As demonstrate above some types of ring structures are considered functionally equivalent which should be taken into account by the search algorithm as well We are currently exploring ways to include such 223fuzziness\224 into the underlying search algorithm directly References I R Agrawal T Imielienski and A Swami.

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
