2009 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event  978-1-4244-3461-9/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE  A New Method for Information Acquisition of Urban Land Use    Zhu Qingwei School of Science and Technology of Surveying and Mapping Xi’an University of Science and Technology  Xi’an, China    Abstract Land use is a kind of important form that affects environment, especially in big city. If land use is not appropriate and that result will destroy ecological environment, lead to land resource wasting, and will cause socio-economic problems. So 
information acquiring of urban land use is one of the key issues of city planning. That is to say, how to monitor, manage and treat information on land use are all important for our zoning commission. As we all known, the precision and efficiency of traditional methods based on spectral feature is not high. One reason is that precision of the photos is low, so high quality results is not possible to acquire; the other reason is that the methods used by us are not high efficient, so we can not acquire satisfying results. In this paper, an unacquainted and small area named WuQi County \(in Shaanxi Province\ is as an example Based on surveying the areas, a lot of RS images of these areas 
are get together. According to the spectral and spatial properties of information on urban land-use in the town and related knowledge, some new methods and technologies are used to RS images and urban land-use extraction with the support of manual work. Idiographic process consists of several parts I   I NTRODUCTION  At present, RS \(remote sensing\chnology is applied widely in some aspect of city planning, in particular, on information acquiring of urban land use. In order to extract RS images with precision and efficiency, new methods and processes should be proposed during the work. The integration 
of RS and GIS, or RS and GPS can be used to this field. GPS can provide the data wanted for work and GIS can analyze RS images. That is to say, GIS GPS and RS can be integrated completely into a new domain: “3S” integrated \(Zhang et al  2004; Chi et al 2005; Ji et al 2006 During past decade, 3S have been applied in many fields including resource and environmental monitoring and protection, land use \(Ye et al 2004; Zhang et al 2007; Zhu et al 2008\ city planning and disaster evaluation\(Ranzinger et 
al 1998; Wang et al 2005; Zhu et al 2007\ and so on  In this paper, data-prep of image correction is introduced. In the process of the correction, selection of control points and selection of checking points on ground are the key issue in the moment. Two methods are discussed and the results are compared. Precision of correction can be controlled within one pixel using new methods. At the same time, data-prep of image merge is discussed, including Landsat TM, Spot and Radarsat During the RS image merging, the software ERDAS are used After comparing different methods, methods of classification 
are discussed deeply on urban land use. Finally, some conclusions are summarized and some new orientations are listed II  PRETREATMENT  A  image correction In this paper, an unacquainted and small area named WuQi County \(in Shaanxi Province\ is as an example  Data Preparation of image correction is introduced, there are mainly comprise two segments: geometric coarse correction and geometric precision correction. In the process of the correction selection of control points and selection of checking points on ground are the key issue in the moment. During processing, for 
more control points, so control of fringe and control of center are both used for locating. The number of Globe control n+2\2. In order to avoid losing information of spectral and enhancing the speed radiance correction is processed before geometric correction At present, there are many resample, such as: Nearest Neighbor arithmetic simpleness, time of complex is small, but maybe incontinuous part in the resultant image\; Bilinear Interpolation mostly adopt method\ Cubic Convolution \(arithmetic complexity, time of complex is heavy, but the result is the best and distortion of image is the least\. In the paper, according to 
the actual terrain, beijing54 is adopted and Nearest Neighbor is used for resample. Precision of correction can be controlled within one pixel. Idiographic method as below   Open two viewers, original image in viewer#1 and referenced image in viewer#2   Select model and define parameter in geometric correction   Setup model of GCP   Collect check-up points on the ground

Resolution Merge is used to different spatial resolution, and after processing, the image can be with high spatial resolution, high spectral resolution, so the image merge can gain their aims The key of image merge is image match before image merge and selection method of image merge. In order to gain the satisfactory result, exactly accurate match must be processed within the two images. Nevertheless, selection methods of merge are based on the specifically intent and characteristic of the image which will be image merged III  THE KEY METHOD ABOUT URBAN LAND USE  The thought of Supervised Classification is that how to confirm pending parameter, how to take unknown classified swatch \(mean study areas into determinant function and do with judgment according to the sort of unknown swatch However, all process must make certain judgment function and judgment rule, which is based on transcendental knowledge One of the key questions about image classification is how to select classification rule \(mean classification implement and sort as possibly as the same kind according to classification implement, the main procession as follows \(Fig.1  the resolution merge with manual work is viewed as the most effective one  Figure 1. Flow of supervised classification Nowadays, the main peculiarity of the frequently use classification method as below \(table 1 Table1 the comparison of often classification methods Method of classifier contrast Minimum distance classifier Simple, oblique variances of all class are supposed equality in this met hod. So the processing rate is quick, but the result is not very good Mahalanohis distance It is good for mu til band remote image, these procession take into account the scatter degreed of spectral vector and oblique correlation, all are base on Mahalanoh distance of spectral feature scale Maximum likelihood classifier This method can get good result, but when collectivity distributing fall short of normal school this method is not good A  Instauration of interpretation keys The corresponding connection between Image and ground characteristic are established through GPS field reconnaissance the investigated ground photo and elaborate analysis indoor. At the same time, interpretation keys are established according to many characteristic of all kind of practicality body on remote image. During this process, ground points are disposed on image through software ERDAS and interpretation keys are executed \(cut out as need\ntegrating all kinds of information Finally, interpretation keys and interpretation keys storeroom as follows table 2 Table 2 classifier definiens of WuQi county land and meanings Name of type meanings irrigable land   Plenty of water, irrigate anytime dry land   Only irrigation by god Garden   A place grow fruit trees scatter holt   10%=<canopy density<20 Woodland  canopy density>=20 Grass natural grassland and manual grassland Shrubbery  canopy density>=40 fluvial surface   Natural earth near fluvial Badlands   Upper is terrene, gravel, lay over level>=70 B  Selection principle of training area In order to ensure high precision while processing supervised classification. Firstly, enough training stylebooks are obligatory lest contingency factor. Generally speaking form 10 to 100 training stylebooks are preparative at least Secondly, the selective pix of stylebook must be representational, that is to say, statistical character of training stylebook must be close to collectivity character of these type Furthermore, the same entity may be shown different spectral image for different naturalness and society, so the spectral image may exist some differences. In other words, selection of stylebook should as possible as come close to the distributing Unsatisfaction   Begin Confirm classified sort Select turning stylebook Model study, parameter estimation St y le evaluation Select classification implement Result and expression Precision anal y sis Select classification implement End Unsatisfaction Satisfaction Satisfaction

Template of supervised classification is as follows table 3 Table 3 temple of supervised classification  Though the classification temple, we put test area into classification with manual work and gain better result, That is to say, this new method can enhance classification precision and processing rate. After classification, we use classification temple tool within software ERDAS to appraise the result. The tools of the appreciation main consist of Alarms, Contingency Matrix, Feature Objects, and Feature Space to Image Masking Histograms, Separability and Statistics In this paper, Contingency Matrix is as tool to appraise which is according to classification temple to analyze AOI training area and judge pos ition of the pixel\(where fall in corresponding sort or not\. The results of Contingency Matrix are a percent matrix, and explain each AOI training area how many pixel fall into the corresponding sort. The sort of AOI training area can be applied into PanallelePiped, Feature Space Maximum Likelihood, and Mahalanobis Distance Appreciation matrix is established with manual work using new method; the result can be got 85% precision, and concrete result as below Fig2 River \(heliu Dry land \(handi Irrigable land \(gengdi Scatter Holt \(shulindi Woodland \(youlindi Garden \(guoyuan Grass Badlands \(luodi Shrubbery \(guanmu  a\fore classification                  \(b\fter classification Figure 2. Comparison of classification image Woodland and Scatter Holt are heavy interactional, why Because the colors of image are very alike that can not be distinguished. So the precision without manual work is low and with manual work is high. Shrubbery and woodland disturb each but not heavy and dry land can be easily differentiated from badlands. River is the easiest distinguished. During this processing, drop shadow is always exist and can be easily got over when using new method, and at the same time, gradient of AOI, slope orientation and overcast degree of AOI can all be learned and discovered D  Appraisal result of classification 1  Method of appreciation After processing supervised classification with manual work, the result should be appraised. There are many methods in software ERDAS, including classification overlay thresholding, recode classes, accuracy assessment and so on Accuracy assessment is introduced in this sort, which is to compare the pixel of special assorted image with the pixel of the known image. In actual work, the assorted data are always compared with the ground true value, with the foregoing map with aviation photo and with other data. Accuracy assessment cell array of accuracy assessment can list the total precision and sort precision, that is to say, the result is simple and can be easily changed, so this method is selected in our project 2  Result of appreciation Some information can be taken by upper table4: river, dry land and badlands are the heaviest precision, and the precision can be equal to 100 percents. Woodland is the lease precision and can be equal to 50 percents. Shrubbery is center and 66.7 percents. But combine with manual work, the precision can be enhanced very much. One point can easily got, that is, the bigger catercorner value of Contingency Matrix, the more sorted precision   


2009 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event  978-1-4244-3461-9/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE  Table 4 precision estimate table of appreciation result  E  post-processing ofclassification No matter what Supervised Classification or Unsupervised Classification, the result brings out some very small map spot At the same time, whether special map to judge or actual application to judge, the very small map spot should be eliminated. We use neatly the instrument of ERDAS, and combine GIS function\(such as: Clump analysis Sieve analysis Eliminate analysis\ of ERDAS with mix these function under manual work, all of these bug can easily eliminated. Now, embody elaborately the course as follows 1  Clump analysis Clump analysis can produce output image according to calculating area of each sorted map spot, calculating area of max border upon area and so on. During these courses, each map spot contain clump information, which is a middle file for farther operation. ERDAS icon menus as follows: Main  Image Interpreter GIS Analysis Clump Clump dialog box, and icon tool is the same too. The main parameters need confirm as below  Input File Output File Coordinate Type Subset Definition Connect Neighbors OK 2  Sieve analysis Sieve analysis manage image mainly according to clump analysis tool bar, delete smaller sorted map spot which are defined by numerical value before. At the same time, the systems make the attribute value of used small map spot to zero. In actual work, Clump analysis and Sieve analysis are always cooperated each other. Especially, if without small map spot or these maps spot may without regard to, this method can work excellently. There is a different point, that is to say, we must confirm size of map spot. The main procession as  Input File Output File Coordinate Type Subset Definition Minimum Size OK 3  Eliminate analysis The key function of Eliminate analysis is to obliterate small map spot of original map and small clump sorted map during processing Clump analysis. These command differ from Sieve this method take the small map spot into near biggest sorted image. Besides, if the image is Clump image, after eliminating the attribute value of small map spot can be changed the former attribute. Apparently, the image that is processed by eliminating turns to predigestion 4  Sieve analysis with manuals work During processing sieve analysis, we combine clump with manuals work. In this part, the band selection and combination optimization of Landsat TM is discussed. After comparing different methods, the resolution merge with manual work is viewed as the most effective one. At the same time combination of band three, band four, and band five is the largest information amount in all other three bands combining schemes. In part three, methods of classification are discussed deeply on urban land use. Different methods, including traditional methods, such as: supervised classification and unsupervised classification, and new method mainly based on supervised classification with manual work \(for short SCMW about classification are experimented. After comparing results the new method including SCMW are brought forward Furthermore, results on sorting types of urban land are also analyzed. The result is shown as figure3  Figure 3. Inquisition RS image of WuQi County  IV  U SING THE T EMPLATE  Overpass the fact work on WuQi county, it proved that the methods supported by manual work could make full use of spectral features, spatial features, geometrical features temporal features, Geo-information and properties, domain and expert knowledge, other statistics data, data mining and knowledge discovery. In contrast with trad itional methods these new methods are more efficient, precise and economical During the work about information classified of urban land use the lowest precision can be up to 90, and the average precision can be up to 92.27. That is to say, information acquiring of urban land use can be well done automatically, and the results are high efficient and real-time. The aim of this paper is to provide a new effective method for information acquiring of urban land use 


2009 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event  978-1-4244-3461-9/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE  For supervised classification, the most important and the key training area are to select samples. In order to obtain better supervised classification results, the sample of training representative area than the choice of supervised classification methods of the math is even more important. As mentioned earlier, a large number of training areas are painted by the field visited. But it is not easy for them to input image processing system on the list. Before input operation, the ground can be understood by the basis fieldwork. All of these, we can make sure the number of vegetation types species in each of the disposed image. At the same time, each type to be found on topographic maps in a number of training areas, and finally putting them into the system. However the field is very complex, that is to say, many objects have the same spectrum Thus, each type of the vegetations is often selecting a number of categories training samples WuQi County, in Shaanxi Province, remote sensing classification map is mainly for the evaluation of land resources provides the basis for the preparation of plans and frameworks, rather than the final map. Therefore, the design of color map take into accounts the recogn ition and analysis of convenience. Taking into account the map type, many colors, it is not easy to distinguish characteristics. In order to highlight the difference between the easily identifiable, they are designed to be rich some color. This is a professional plan with the general color difference The studies have shown that the use of new methods and technologies \(mean that the supervised classification methods with the support of manual work\ WuQi County in Shaanxi Province, the production of remote sensing classification is feasible. In the basic geographic information systems, field survey, as well as other auxiliary information is carried out under the supervised classification. The study area will be divided into irrigated, dry land, orchards, woodland and has woodland, grassland, shrub forest, river water and bare land farming, all together 9 objects categories. At the same time, the visual interpretation, computer unsupervised classification are both used respectively, and its accuracy were gotten 75 100%, 75%, 90.91%, 50.0%, 90%, 66.67%, 100% and 100 the overall accuracy of 85.0%. Summing-up, the use of air image with this new method can r each the accuracy of image interpretation, and the result can be used as the basis map of land use At the same time, we also see that the supervised classification of remote sensing classification image is only spectra map. To become a map of the land resource utilization which to land resource, we must study the statue of plant growth. At the same time, it is also necessary to conduct spectral analysis, set up vegetation model of vegetation density canopy density, leaf area, and study them synthetically  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work is supported by Xi’an University of Science and Technology \(innovate item, Principal Zhu Qingwei\, and supported by Xi’an University of Science and Technology Doctor Startup Fund, Principal Zhu Qingwei R EFERENCES   1  Du Penjun.

  6  Figure 6 \226 Cost and Schedule Rules of Thumb provide ea rly-CML teams a quick way to benchmark their assumed project resource profiles 5  C OST AND S CHEDULE  P ROFILE R ULES OF T HUMB  Our teams are routinely ch allenged during concept development to estimate adequate cost and schedule profiles for Phases A through D. Ba sed on two decades of JPL missions, we developed metrics categorized by mission class to provide quick benchmarks \(Figure 6\. They are embedded in Team X and are widely used by Pre-Phase A teams to confirm that their cost and schedule profiles are \223in family.\224 For example, a planetary mission with development cost between $250 - 1000 M would typically use 8 - 12 months and 3 - 5% of its total development budget to complete Phase A 6  F ORMULATION S UPPORT T EAM  When a study or proposal team reaches Step 2 or is designated as a pre-projec t, they are assigned an institutionally funded representative from the Formulation Support Team to help them interpret NASA and JPL requirements and to assist them get off to a quick and effective start. Process support includes the following 200  Planning documents and templates 200  Life cycle review criteria and agenda 200  EVM and WBS tailoring 200  Pre-Project Principles and Practices 200  Flight Project Practices, Design Principles and NPR 7120.5 200  Gate product list 200  Cost and schedule \223rules of thumb\224 200  Cost risk subfactors 200  Schedule analysis 200  Concept maturity assessments 200  Requirements \223PIT Session\224 process and document architecture The Formulation Support Team comprises senior engineers with experience in management and one or more technical disciplines. They attend proposal, pre-project or project team weekly staff meetings a nd help formulate plans that address project-unique requir ements. They also provide an  additional communications channel to upper management if needed The team is organized and deployed following the model of JPL\222s Project Support Team, used successfully for several years to assist flight projects. The two institutional support teams share personnel to assure cross-pollination between formulation and implementation and to help project teams transition seamlessly into implementation Projects recently supported include Juno GRAIL NuStar  DESDynI, MSO, ST-9, and Urey 7  P RE P ROJECT P RINCIPLES  AND P RACTICES  P4 The CML scale discussed earlier provides a metric for measuring maturity but it does not address whether the concept has sufficient design margin or flexibility to survive 


  7 the requirements growth, development problems and performance shortfalls that ar e typically encountered during implementation. In order to characterize a concept\222s 223robustness\224 we needed to identify some additional quantitative criteria. Questions that needed to be addressed included: \(1\w much scien ce margin is appropriate at CML 3? \(2\How is the value of inheritance quantified at CML 4? \(3\How much reserve is needed at CML 5 In 2001, JPL first issued the Flight Project Practices FPP and Design Principles DP im p r o v e in stitu tion a l  consistency in implementing science mission flight projects The project community has derived high value from these documented guidelines. We concluded that advanced study and proposal teams need anal ogous guidelines tailored to the type of design decisions they make throughout early CML. Adequate and reasonable standards for the conduct of early formulation work could reduce downstream situations where flight projects find themselves attempting to implement insufficiently defined or weakly-traded mission concepts arising from ambitious studies or proposals Thus JPL created the Pre-Project Principles & Practices  P4\, a body of guidelines intended as a \223front end\224 to the FPP and DP. Criteria for the content and completeness of a concept are captured as \223Princip les\224, e.g., a description of what must be included in a mission operations concept Processes to be followed during concept development activities are defined as \223Practices\224, e.g., a requirement that advanced-study participants archive intermediate products in an online library We have found that acceptance of process constraints especially by entrepreneurial engineers and scientists hinges on their understanding of why the constraints make sense. Thus to facilitate accep tance and foster innovation the P4 has three features: \(1\ale is provided throughout; \(2\practices are limited to those repeatedly proven as necessary or extrem ely effective; and \(3\h principles and practices are iden tified as either guidelines or requirements. The mix emphasizes guidelines for the early CML, and shifts toward rigorous, specific requirements as CML progresses User groups originated, drafted, and iterated the P4 guidelines and requirements over a two-year period. Results were validated by the broader user community and program managers. The P4 is already in use and being migrated to a web-hosted client to support access and query by lifecycle review, concept element \(e.g., system design\ML or textstring search The hardcopy edition is organized into 23 sections describing the engineering and management concept elements listed in Figure 4. The requirements and guidelines in each section are divided into sub-sections corresponding to the three lifecycle subphases: Advanced Studies spanning CML 1 \226 3; Concept Development for CML 4 \226 5 and Early Formulation for CML 6 - 7 At the beginning of each section, a flow chart maps the evolution of the relevant requirements across the lifecycle Figure 7\he correspondin g row from the CML matrix details how the maturity increases The P4 also includes the subset of Flight Project Practices and Design Principles that affect specific actions and decisions that have to be made during early portions of the lifecycle. Although there are no flight project practices directly applicable during the Advanced Studies sub-phase a moderate number are applicable during Concept Development, and the preponderance of requirements identified for Early Formulation are reproduced from the FPP. The complete FPP is being made accessible from the P4 web client. Additional chapters in P4 describe early formulation lifecycle reviews the CML matrix, and the overall concept development process 8  F RONTLINE  W EB PORTAL  JPL\222s Project Support Website, developed nine years ago, is widely used by the project implementation community. To provide analogous support to the \223Frontline\224 community we created the Frontline web portal \(Figure 8\ as a consolidated source of information for concept development, proposal preparation and early formulation. It provides links to institutional and NASA requirements processes, event calendars, and upcoming proposal opportunities; and provides reference descriptions of ongoing projects, Team X studies, lifecycle reviews, and gate products 9  M ISSION D EVELOPMENT W ORKSHOP  Upgrading tools and providing information is insufficient to substantively improve the \223culture\224 of formulation and achieve the goals described ear lier. We recognized that systemic development of a frontline community was needed, in which formulators and implementers could share their views, experiences, and lessons. Only by bridging these cultures could we create better-understood and moreimplementable mission concepts, and implement missions closer to what the scientists originally envisioned Our principal mechanism for frontline community development is a training and discussion forum called the Mission Development Workshop \(MDW\This week-long off-site workshop was organized to supplement JPL\222s highly successful Project Manager Worksh incorporates case studies, panel discussions, and presentations by Laboratory experts to teach and inspire participants, and give them a \223safe\224 environment to challenge principles and assumptions

This data can be seen in the transient thrust measurement in Figure 25   Figure 25 Transient thrust measurement as T6LA is switched on at t=22, off at t-47 and the mass flow is switched off at t=70. Cathode is operated at 25Amps with 0.2mg/s argon  As seen above the additional thrust component appears almost instantaneously \(with some delay due to the inertia of the target thrust balance\he discharge is switched on and removed instantaneously as the discharge is extinguished. As the mass flow is switched off however a characteristic transient is seen as the cathode and feed lines depressurize. If the thrust component which appears during the discharge was indeed electrothermal it would take 10-20 seconds to reach steady state as seen in the mass flow switch-off transient however it does not. In addition the theoretical MHD thrust determined by the Maecker formula for a similar geometrical configuration to the T6 cathode matches close to the thrust extrapolations level at zero mass flowrate as shown in Figure 26   Figure 26 T6 thrust characteristics with theoretical MHD thrust at the respective current levels  This data strengthens the hypothesis that the T6LA operates in an MPDT type mode at low flowrates and high currents    


  14 F  Electrostatic acceleration  One other mechanism which coul d also play a role in the thrust generation in both the T5CA and T6LA is electrostatic acceleration of ions through a potential drop due to the formation of a region of positive plasma potential. The existence of this positive column has been seen extensively in experimental measurements and has been proposed as a means of acceleration as ions fall down the potential hill. The structure of the plasma potential is of particular interest because it ma y also be directly associated with the attainable ion energies. High energy ion erosion has been identified as the most probable near-term cause of failure during extended life tests at NASA JPL on the NSTAR ion thruster 51 The plasma density and potential profiles downstream of the keep er electrode in the NSTAR hollow cathode have been extensively measured with scanning probes by Herman and Gallimore 52 Jameson, et al 53 and by Sengupta, et al 54   The source of the energy to pr oduce these ions in excess of 90eV is likely to be RF plasma potential oscillations in the near cathode plume from plasma instabilities 55 Goebel postulated that the source of these plasma potential oscillations is likely turbulent ion acoustic waves generated in the hollow cathode discharge plasma or ionization instabilities termed predator-prey modes in the near-cathode plume region. Evidence indicates that discharge plasma potential oscillations measured by Goebel et al. had amplitudes about twice the average discharge voltage, large enough to account for high ener gy ions accelerated through the potential gap between the oscillation peak and cathode potential 56   Although ions of extreme energies have been attributed to these RF plasma oscillations, the existence of a spatially rising plasma potential cannot be ignored as a source of bulk ion acceleration. It has b een sufficient to regard the spatial or temporal profiles of the plasma potential obtained by the measurements were suffi cient to be considered the mechanism for the generation and direction of high-energy ions well in excess of the discharge voltage. The details of how discharges establishes a spatially rising plasma potential downstream of the keep er or the reasons for the absence of a non-monotonic profile have not yet been fully identified and explained  In the case of a potential hill, an electric field exists across a plasma potential drop  dx dV E 212  M VVe V f e  28 The ion velocity at any point follows from conservation of energy to give the particle velocities shown in Figure 27  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Ion Energy [eV Ion Velocity [km/s Krypton Argon Xenon  Figure 27 Corresponding ion velocities with krypton and xenon for a given energy  Investigations by the author 57 on a \274 inch hollow cathode with an electrostatic energy analyzer operating on xenon and krypton have shown that bulk acceleration of ions is found, particularly with increasing discharge current and decreasing mass flowrate, where peak plasma potentials are likely to increase. An exampl e of this bulk acceleration is shown in Figures 28 and 29 for xenon   Figure 28 Ion energy distributions at 10 amps with xenon  At 10Amps discharge current the ESA data shows slightly energy peaks up to 62.4eV which are likely caused by ion acoustic waves. However the plot also begins to show a bulk acceleration of the 2.44sccm and 2.05sccm conditions 212  27  In this case, the velocity gained by a singly charged particle moving through the potential is   2 1 0 2 


  15 20eV\ereby the complete distribution is shifted up in energy; a process exemplified at higher currents. At 16Amps Figure 26 shows peak ion energies are significantly higher than for the 10Amp condition and with much greater bulk acceleration of plasma; the data for the 2.05sccm flow condition for instance shows little to no ions with energies less than 35eV. The 2.94sccm condition shows a decrease in collected cu rrent contrary to the trend which may be due to some thermal movement, MHD vectoring of the plume or plume expansion   Figure 29 Ion energy distributions at 16 amps with xenon Since no measurements of plasma potential have been made of the T5 or T6 configurations it is not possible to confirm or deny the significance of such a mechanism in our thrust measurements however such a mechanism would only be significant if the plasma was highly ionized and remained in that state through the accelerati on process. If this were the case then plasma potential hill acceleration may play a role in thrust production. Future investigations will aim to identify the role of this mechanism in thrust production by taking plasma potential measurements C ONCLUSION   An overview of the design considerations for hollow cathode thruster optimization has been presented along with data collected from configurations of the T5 and T6 hollow cathode thrusters. The basis for several thrust production mechanisms has been proposed  Analysis of the T5CA results indicate that the thrust mechanism may be explicable by electrothermal type operation in a conventional gas-dynamic mode however with significant plasma pressure contributing to increased thrust as a result of the electron pressure component at the orifice exit. The exact thrust mechanisms of the T6 hollow cathode have been debated for some time. Our results indicate that for high specific im pulse there is considerable evidence that at high currents and low flowrates, the hollow cathode operates as a low power MPD thruster. Due to the relatively low currents, elect ron convective and radiative losses dominate performance and thus give poor thrust efficiencies. If this is the case operation at elevated currents is likely to significantly improve performance and thrust efficiency; although this will be well beyond the rated current capacity for the T6 cathode. Indeed multi-channel hollow cathodes have been proposed and built for MPD thrusters for some time. If the hollow cathode thruster is to have a place in the family of MPD accelerators, it may be as a very low power thruster <2kW \(owing to the low discharge voltages very little power conditioning required. Thrust efficienci es are unlikely to improve significantly since this will scale quadratically with discharge current and will quickly enter much higher power regimes of operation.  Analysis would indicate that while electrothermal acceleration does play a role in T6 thrust production, it does not increase significantly as mass flow is decreased. This suggests that either electron temperature does not increase significantly at lower flow rates or that the energy equipartition between electrons-ions and electronneutrals remains too low for any substantial increase in heat transfer. If the flow in the T6 cathode is also substantially ionized it has also been shown that plasma potential hill acceleration may play a role in thrust production however this requires further investigation  Further detailed analysis is required to verify the existence of each mechanism and to understand the best means in which to utilize them to give greater performance. Further work is also required on anode design in order to optimize performance and increase efficiency. The low voltages obtained in the T6LA and T5CA designs highlight the importance of plasma anode interaction and anode geometry. Previously keeper design has been considered relatively insignificant; however as has been shown optimized keeper design is imperative for hollow cathode thrusters, but also for neutralizers for Hall thrusters, ion engines and plasma contactors for minimization of discharge voltage R EFERENCES   1  Gray, H L, "Development of ion propulsion systems", GEC Rev 12, 3, 154-168, 1997 2 Wallace, N C and Feam, D G, "The design and performance of the T6 ion thruster AIAA Paper 98-3342, 1998 3 Fearn, D, Singfield, A, Wallace, N, Gab-, S and Harris, P The operation of ion thruster hollow cathodes using rare gas propellants AIAA Paper 90-2584, 1990 4 Latham, P M, Martin, A R and Bond, A, "Design, manufacture and performance of the UK-25 engineering model thruster", AIAA Paper 90-2541, 1990 5 Harris, P T and Gair, S, "A revi ew of the cathode construction for the RAE 10/25 mN thruster", IEPC Paper 88-078, 1988 6 Philip, C M and Fearn, D G Recent hollow cathode investigations at the Roya l Aircraft Establishment AIAA paper 73-1137, \(1973 7 Fearn, D G The operation of hollow cathodes under conditions suitable for ion beam neutralization Proc Conf on Electric

presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
