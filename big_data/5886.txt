What are Big-Data Analytics Tools  Big-data analytics employ software tools from advanced analytics disciplines such as data mining and predictive analytics  Mining data, trends or analysis of these multi-terabyte data sets requires parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers to keep pace with user demands and processing expectations A new class of big-data methods have emerged to address user demands for horizontal scaling and availability of underlying data  Hadoop and MapReduce among others, offer fast processing speed  Great for large-scale static data sets, but not so great for real-time data  Most organizations employ a hybrid method combining technologies  A robust open source framework supports processing in clustered systems  Platform-as-a-service vendors \(Microsoft, Amazon, Google\fer turn-key solutions for analysts to simply upload link and compute basic data sets  Great for simple historical analysis; bad for real-time or diverse data sets BIG-DATA ANALYTICS

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rolling… I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors  


Example 2: Identifying Causal Factors CAUSAL FACTORS  Indicators – Data Element Methods – Identifying Context and Causes  Time of day  Date range \(month day  Aircraft type  Fix or coordinates  Originating airport  Destination airport  Weather notes We pinpoint the sequencing of flights on the IAH Junction Seven departure \(at CUZZZ\the specified wind conditions to find cases wher e a B737-900 at 20,000 feet precedes by 11 miles a B737-800 at 17,000 feet  Search related data sets including ASDI flight tracks, local traffic and congestion  Weather conditions for alter native causes \(winds aloft shear and convecti ve activity  Airline specific informati on \(repeated occurrence of event in aircraft type Big data gives us visibility into contextual factors even if specific data points are missing such as a specific date or route Big-data analytics gives us insight into unreported factors as well

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Today’s cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlight’s data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlight’s hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlight’s method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
