This paper proposes an improved K-means algorithm named PKM. PKM is based on similarity degree among data points made by cumulated K-means, and get the final clustering partition via fuzzy clustering analysis \(Transitive Closure Method precise rate of clustering higher, and reduce the effects made by isolated points and random clustering center, at the same time, can recognize isolated points better. Experiments with analog data and real data demonstrate its advantage Keywords- K-means; fuzzy clustering; similarity degree I. INTRODUCTION Birds of a feather flock together", clustering is a basic cognizing activity of human. Clustering divides data object groupings into many clusters, to make objects in the same cluster have upper similarity while objects in different clusters have bigger dissimilarity. The cluster divided by clustering operation is unknown, the cluster formation is totally data-driven, belonged to non-instructional learning method So far, a lot of clustering algorithms have been proposed, in common place, clustering technology can be divided into: Partit ioning method[8], Hierarchical method[9], Density-based method[10], Grid-based method[11] and Model-based method[12]. Besides these five methods , there are a great deal of methods, such as Fuzzy theory-based method[4], clustering algorithm for processing mult idimensional data, dynamic data clustering algorithms combining basic clustering algorithms and some new technologies[13 This article aims at three d isadvantage aspects clustering veracity, stability, valid ity, proposing an improved K-means algorithm. This algorithm 


amalgamates lots of results of running KNN, cumulates similarity among data formed by single similar information, consequently, reduces the effects to the whole clustering division results made by some instable clustering results. This method reduces the effects to single clustering algorithm caused by shape of data distributing , input sequence of data , change of parameters, makes clustering results not easily plunged partly optimis m The outline is at follows: introducing some relative concepts and theories on K-means algorithm and fuzzy clustering firstly; then proposing PKM algorithm with experiment proof and analysis, proving its advantage finally, making some conclusion and pointing out the future working direction II. RELATIVE WORK A. K-means algorithm This is a  widely-used clustering algorithm, owing to its simple and convenience. Algorithm description of K-means is as follows a initial clustering centers b c clustering centers, and cluster this instance to the class which distance is min imal 2009 International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelligence 978-0-7695-3661-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/ECBI.2009.106 523 d e these centroids do not change Performance analysis x advantage a clustering problems, simple and quickly b for processing big data sets c difference among clusters, the result is better x disadvantage K-means only can be used under the situation that the average value has been defined.

difference on size. Besides, it's sensitive to "noise" and isolated points data, a little  data like th is can make huge effects on average values B. Clustering method based on fuzzy relation transitive closure 1 the math basis of fuzzy method. The uncertain is the research object of fuzzy sets theory, and extension of classical sets theory. Subordinate degree function is the characteristic function of fuzzy sets, and nucleus of fuzzy concept. Its values ranged from ordinary set{0,1} to continuous value in [0,1] closed range . Definition of subordinate degree function is Supposed a region U, any mapping ?A from U to [0,1 closed range, ?A ?U?[0,1]?u??A \(u decide a fuzzy subset A of U, ?A \(u degree to u, indicates the degree u belongs to A Fuzzy inference is from prerequisite \(A rule \(if A  then B B containment relation .Combination of prerequisite and rule in inference is a kind of compound relation. In fuzzy method, relation is a fuzzy set. Finding relation is to find the subordinate degree function. How to choose containment relation and compound algorithm is the key to fuzzy inference, which has lots of experience 2  demarcat ing and clustering, in which, the complicated work is getting fuzzy similar matrix and calculating transitive closure x  Demarcating\(building the fuzzy similar matrix Supposed a sample set X={x1, x2,…, xn}, n is the number of samples ,and each sample xi is assumed given by a group of characteristic data. The purpose if build ing fuzzy similar matrix sim is to make clear about its similar coefficient simij, that is to say, similar degree between xi and xj. Method computing similar degree in this article is Co-Association matrix[1] given by Fred, which is used to measure similar degree among data points Map N div isions of n data points to an n*n Co-Association matrix: C\(i,j times that i and j belongs to a same cluster in N div ision x  Clustering\(classifying the sample sets Definition 1.

X={x1, x2 ,…,xd} is a data point, n is the number of data points,n>2. PKM algorithm in this article will run K-means many times to DB in order to form a div ision set P={P1,P2 ……,PM}for information accumulating. Then divide sim matrix corresponded to P with fuzzy clustering algorithm ,to make this division has the best clustering quality, and can discern isolated points effectively Princip le of PKM algorithm is shown in Figure 1     Figure 1.  Main idea of PKM algorithm A. Relative definitions 1 A policy mechanism mixing clustering results to measure similar degree among data points is assumed, in order to eliminate K-means’s effects caused by choosing clustering initial value and isolated points [3 Mix M t imes K-means clustering of n data points to make an n*n sim matrix: sim\(i,j and j belongs to the same cluster in M times clustering. In the matrix, sim\(i,j j,i i,i is symmetric and self-inverse B.

    Figure 2.  Flow chart of PKM algorithm x Algorithm for the first phase: the formation of similarity matrix The method of forming similarity matrix is the core of integration clustering algorithm based on K-means. On one hand, the method converts high-dimensional data to low-d imensional, simplifies the operation of the complexity o f clustering algorithm .On the other hand, it integrates the characteristics of numbers of K-means Y Generate M divisions Data Set DB Sim Matrix Initial Run KNN update sim matrix calculate si m’s transitive closure Get the section matrix with threshold value output N Phase 1 generate the simila r matrix sim transitive closure of sim mat rix division Deliver the sim matrix Phase 2 process sim mat rix by fuzzy clustering method  K< M Y 525 division, increase the stability and accuracy of the algorithm Cycle M t imes to form the similarity matrix .in each time, accord ing to a random selection of cluster centers on the data set to run K-means, so it will produce some cluster members for each cluster, then update the sim matrix, integrate the new informat ion generated by clustering into the sim matrix 


x Algorithm for the second phase: Based on the fuzzy relationship between the transitive closure of the clustering method According to the formation of sim matrix, we use fuzzy clustering to divide. The sim matrix meets symmetry and reflexiv ity, and doesn’t meet the transitivit so calculated the sim matrix’s transitive closure by square method. According to a given threshold ?, mapped the number of transitive closure to \(0,1 element in each column of R? equating 1 is the same type[6 The following analysis is PKM algorithm's time complexity. The time complexity of running M times K-means algorithm to build the sim matrix is O\(nkl*M in which n is the number of data points, k is the number of clusters, t is the number of iteration, usually k<<n and t<<n. The time complexity of using fuzzy clustering methods to divide data sets is O\(n2 complexity is O\(n2 IV. EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS A. Experiment 1 IRIS data set is a common-used testing data in clustering analysis. It contains 150 data points totally, be make up of three kinds of plants: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica, and one king\(Setosa other two linear, at the same time, the rest two have partly overlap in characteristic space. Each kind has 50 data points, every data point has four numeric attributes Assume each kind of data points set is Si, data points as a matter of fact is Fi after algorithm’s completion number of cluster is K. For assessing algorithm’s clustering effect, we define clustering’s precise rate formalized Precise rate= 1 1 k i i i k i i S F S     100%, in fact 1 k

Experiment 2 This experiment describes the effect of choosing attributes to PKM’s precise rate emphatically. Car Evaluation Database[5], totally has 1728 data packets 


which have 7 attributes described as  Table 3 and 526 Classification’s description as Table 4 TABLE 3.  ATTRIBUTES DESCRIBED Attribute’s name classification buying—buying price vhigh  high  med  low maint—price of the maintenance vhigh  high  med  low doors—number of doors 2  3  4  5more persons—capacity in terms of persons to carry 2  4  more lug_boot—the size of luggage boot small  med  big safety—estimated safety of the car low  med  high TABLE 4.

We introduce the idea of informat ion gain. Information is based on entropy in information theory. Entropy is a measurement of in definitude of objects’ corresponding attributes The bigger an attribute’s entropy is, the bigger the in definitude information it has, the more beneficial to classify the data. We can choose the attribute which has higher information gain as the classification attribute Assumed S is a set of s data samples. Supposed class mark attribute has m different value, define mm d ifferent class Ci \(i=1,2,…,m class Ci. Expected informat ion for a sample classification is given by I\(s1,s2,……,sm 0 1 ij ij t j t OO O  t in  which pi is the probability of any sample belongs to Ci, can be estimated by SiS  usually Assumed attribute A has v different value a1,a2,……,av}. We can use attribute A to divide S into v subsets{S1,S2,……?Sv},in which, Sj contains the samples 


in S whose value is aj in A Assumed sij is class Ci’s sample number in subset Sj entropy based on the subsets divided by A is defined as E\(A 1 2 1 2 1  v j j j j j S S I S S S PM PM?6 ?6  Here, 1 2j jS S S PM?6  is served as weight of jth subset, and equals subset’s\(whose A value is aj number divide sample total is S. the smaller entropy is the higher pure degree of subset’s division is Pay attention, according to the expected information computing formula above, to some subset Sj, its expected information is: 1 2 1  m ij ij i p lb p   where pij =  Sij|Sij | , is the probability of samples in Sj belonging to class Ci We can get the corresponding information gain value from expected information and entropy. Information gain which will be get from div isions on A is given by the formula Gain\(A s1, s2,……, sm A Through the information gain’s computing method above, we get each attribute’s information gain in Car Evaluation data set is Gain\(buying Gain\(maint Gain\(doors Gain\(persons Gain\(lug_boot Gain\(safety According to the information gain, firstly we only choose persons and safety as testing attributes, and map 


the value of these two attributes to numeric, result of running PKM is not ideal. Result is shown in the Table 5 TABLE 5.

So appropriate attributes can enhance algorithm’s performance effective C.

SUMMARY AND FORWARD This paper proposes an improved K-means numerical algorithm and eliminates the influence of traditional K-means numerical algorithm on random init ial clustering center and isolated points , which has good accuracy and effectively discern the isolated points 


Different experiments have illuminated the effectively and stability of PKM. In comparison of traditional K-means numerical algorithm, PKM has been proved with a better performance. This paper also provides tests on real traffic data, which proved the better performance of this algorithm on non-convex data set But there are some things we need to take into account in the future, like the effect of using transitive closure method on execution speed, the high time complexity to calculate equivalent matrix and parameter optimization As this numerical algorithm has a good effect on identifying the isolated points, we may use it in distinguishing the abnormalities of traffic data and other aspects in the future work ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China under grant No. 2007AA01Z404 REFERENCE 1] A Fred, A K Jain, Data clustering using evidence accumulation The l6th Int’l Conf on Pattern Recognition \(ICPR 2002 Canada , 2002 2] A.K.

pursuing an integrated approach to diagnostics and prognostics, combining technologies for enhanced data preprocessing, advanced diagnostic-support algorithms, fusion at the sensor/feature levels, and an adequate framework for false alarm mitigation and uncertainty management. An architecture for achieving such integration is presented, with emphasis on supporting a robust performance of diagnostics operations, even in the presence of such kinds of disturbances as those observed in data acquired by HUMS vibration sensors. The present study also gives relevance to seeded fault because the technologies discussed can integrate knowledge about damage mechanism interactions or physics-of-failure models, as well as make use of multiple-sensor and multiple-feature data sets representative of known fault conditions For this reason, the team behind this project is evaluating a potential opportunity to perform a series of tests on rotorcraft drive train bearings with varying fault severities and under multiple, though realistic, operating conditions Such tests are being planned to provide algorithm/model validations, as well as diagnostic/prognostic performance assessments, in support of providing the U.S. Army with technologies that make detection systems more robust allow for the implementation of prognostics, and extend the useful life of drive train components.

movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
