Keywords- corporate governance performance; workflow technology; business process reengineering; articles of association I   I NTRODUCTION  The corporate business process consists of a series of related tasks. These tasks are serially or parallel executed according to the administrative rules. And the business objectives of the corporation are completed simultaneously with the successful accomplishment of above tasks.  Since industrial age, process organization, management and optimization is the hot research of corporate management And the related work has been progressive. Previously, the work was finished artificially before the introduction of management information system 
However, the artificial business process reengineering and the traditional function-oriented information computer system were very limited and inapplicable with the development of modern corporations. Therefore, the corporations require a more efficient software system to enhance business process reengineering and automation With the application of comp uter technology, corporate information management has several new developmental directions. The traditional computer management information system has three major functions entitled 001\000 transaction processing 001\001  001\000 information processing 
001\001  and 001\000 decision support 001\001 Information transmission and processing is known as a main function of computer management information system and basis of transaction processing and decision support of corporations and administrative departments. As a result, it is an important part of professional work of corporations and administrative departments. In mid-1980s, the concept of workflow arose with the prompt development of computer network technology, distributed database technology and multicomputer cooperation work technology. Presently workflow technology provides an amazing approach for 
corporations to achieve these business objectives Moreover, the article of association is an agreement binding upon all parties. It is common for articles of association of corporations to provide for corporate management system. As soon as workflow technology is combined with articles of association, the application of technology takes legal effect on the corporation shareholders, directors, and managers II  BRIEF  INTRODUCTION  TO  WORKFLOW  TECHNOLOGY Workflow is an emerging technology which has been developed quickly in recent years. Workflow management 
is a kind of technical means of effectively controlling and coordinating the execution of complex activities and the mutual information between man and application software Although workflow technology has different application ranges and multiple implementation modes, seen from its application process, most implemented workflow management systems undergo four stages, entitled 001\000 flow definition 001\001  001\000 flow optimization 001\001  001\000 system development 001\001 and 001\000 workflow management system

 Compared with these stages of corporate business process reengineering above, it is seen that workflow technology can be used to support flow analysis, flow optimization, system implementation and project evaluation well; and workflow management system can be applied to carry out real-time monitoring and scheduling of examples and realize the management and control of corporate processes. Therefore, workflow management technology is often used for implementing corporate business process reengineering  III  THE  APPLICATION  OF  WORKFLOW  TECHNOLOGY  IN  CONCRETE  SYSTEMS  Take the use of workflow technology in the business process reengineering of a food corporation as an example to simply explain how workflow technology is exactly applied In traditional corporate organization forms, various flows have not received enough attention. At that time, flow activities were so scattered in different functional departments that it was unable to embody due relations and difficult to describe the global flow process and mention the further optimization of flow. In fact, the essence of flow management is flow. Nowadays, the corporation breaks the original hierarchical departments, recombine them according to all activities with added value, and establish an organization on the basis of flow. These activities make the trend of key flows in the organization more clear and suitable for computerized processing and implementation The workflow mentioned by us is an integrated technology containing various stages of flow management And the use of workflow in flow management is divided into three stages, namely flow modeling, flow simulation analysis and flow optimization. It is concretely embodied as follows 000  A    Flow modeling Establishment of a flow model \(workflow model according to the business process in a corporation refers to the description of a business flow by a formal definition which can be processed by computer. Flow modeling is an important basis of flow analysis and optimization. The business flow in a corporation is the reflection of the production and operation process of the corporation Application of workflow technology to the flow management of the corporation requires that the workflow products have extremely strong flow modeling ability and the current workflow technology can realize it maturely. In this aspect, many research institutes of workflow technology have studied and developed description methods of workflow model. Common methods include directed graph Petri net and formal language grammar of object model, etc In the ordinary course of things, the main idea of the method of establishing a workflow model is to break down the business process of a corporation into a series of activities with logical relations, then describe the attribute of each activity and correlations among these activities to define a workflow model. To establish a workflow model, it is of overriding importance to understand the flow of corporate business process. Of course, the collection of such information needs the guidance and support provided by the idea of flow management. It ensures the workflow model established on the basis of correct information more correct and reliable. Only a comparatively perfect workflow model got at last can get the operation process of a corporation described more fully Taking the office outgoing message of Zhenxin Food as an example, the general flow of outgoing message management can be described as follows The document newly drafted by a department is sent to the manager of the department for approval and then it is handed to the company office after getting the approval, if not, redraft it The chief of office checks and approves it and reports it to company directors for approval. Company directors hold a meeting for approval, it is issued after getting the approval, if not, return it Finally, the approved document is issued and filed away formally After understanding this flow, we use the software IGRAFX PROCESS to establish the workflow model of the outgoing message management, shown as the following figure  Fig 2 Workflow Model of Outgoing Message Management Based on Petri Net 000  B    Flow simulation analysis Corporate flow management is not to simply use various advanced automation and inform ation techniques to realize the automation of corporate ope ration process, it increases key performance indexes of business process by optimizing and even reengineering the imperfect factors in the original flows. And therefore, analyzing flows and finding and solving problems are important links of implementing flow management Workflow model reflects the structure and dynamic behaviors of business process comparatively comprehensively, so making a diagnosis of the existing corporate flow by analyzing the performance of workflow model is an effective and reliable method We can carry out simulation analysis of model performance indexes by workflow simulation analysis method. After the simulation of workflow model is executed, the system will collect simulation data and

 provide users with the data for the quantitative analysis of the performance of the established workflow model The simulation data include activity execution time resource use time, activity cost and resource utilization, etc Through the quantitative analysis of these data, we can judge which activities have the maximum cost, the longest running time, and expend lots of resources but bring small profits in the flows. And then we can analyze which activities are the key activities in the flows, and which flows can not bring such incremental effect that need improving or even reengineering The response time of each step got by implementing workflow simulation of the above outgoing message management flow is shown as Table 1 Table 1The Time Value before Flow Optimized Business Flow Run 1 Run 2 Run 3 Run 4 Run 5 Run 6 Run 7 Department drafts the document 3.6 3.1 3.2 3.6 3.4 3.1 3 Department manager checks the document 5.1 5.6 5 5.3 5.4 5.2 5.2 Chief of office checks the document 8.8 8.9 9.2 9 9.1 9.1 8.9 Corporate director checks the document 30.5 29.4 28.3 29.6 30 28.3 28.7 Issue 2.3 2.1 2.2 2.1 2.5 2 2 Issued document is filed away 0.6 0.3 0.7 0.8 0.6 0.7 0.5 According to simulation many times, we find that the link "The corporate director checks the document" is the bottleneck and it tallies with the visual analysis in practice the link needs to be determined by holding a meeting in which many departments and personnel are involved. As a result, it is difficult to unify their opinions. In order to realize the object of flow optimization and reengineering checking time must be reduced 000  C    Flow optimization After analyzing the simulation results of flow, we need to modify and optimize the workflow model, thereby achieving the goal of corporate flow optimization On the one hand, workflow simulation execution can be used to compare several design schemes of business process and find out the optimal scheme from them. We can evaluate different schemes effectively and quantitatively and then select the optimal scheme by modifying bottleneck links in the workflow model, analyzing, and comparing them. On the other hand, there are many methods of corporate flow optimization, such as changing transaction route, changing the execution time of a certain activity or some activities in the flow, changing organization structure and modifying the number of resources, etc. After such change is made, we can obtain the feasibility of the modification scheme easily by simulation execution, and achieve the goal of flow optimization by modifying the workflow model many times. Thus, the optimized workflow model is the basis of corporation 000 s actual business flow improvement In the above outgoing message management flow obviously, we optimize the step 001\000 The corporate director checks the document 001\001 To improve work efficiency, only a special department is needed to fulfill check function. The response time of the optimized flow after simulation execution many times is shown as Table 2 Table 2 The Time Value Before Flow Optimized Business Flow Run1 Run2 Run3 Run4 Run5 Run6 Run7 The department drafts the document 3.1 2.9 3.5 3.2 3 3 3.1 The department manager checks the document 5.2 5.3 5.2 5.5 5 4.9 5.4 The chief of office checks the document 8.5 8.9 9.1 9.2 8.7 9 8.9 The corporate director checks the document 11.6 11.3 11.2 11.5 11.1 11 10.8 Issue the document 2.1 2 2..1 2 1.9 1.9 2.3 The issued document is filed away 0.8 0.6 0.5 0.8 1 1.1 0.5 From the above analysis, we can see that good results can be obtained by optimization. Of course, it is only a simple example of optimization. In practical operation, the original flow may need a more thorough design and modification. Workflow technology provides a good simulation execution environment for us so as to avoid the failure caused by unforeseeable consequences after actual corporate flow is optimized IV  THE  INCORPORATION  OF  WORKFLOW  TECHNOLOGY  INTO  ARTICLES  OF  ASSOCIATION   When investors organize a corporation, they are bond by the article of association of corporations, which reflects their will of management of corporation. In other words, the articles of association drafted by shareholders are the instructional rules and regulations of corporate management As for the corporation, it needs efficient management system, especially fast information system reengineering to optimize corporate governance performance. So, it is necessary to incorporate workflow technology into article of association Only be set down in the article of association and registered by registration department, the workflow technology can get the credibility and authority of law

 found that though one rule get high confidence and support, it still have no actual significance even misleading. Therefore, we put forward an idea about adding a threshold value based on the correlation interest measure, and give out formal definition and practical significance. The rules are considered as interested and mined, only if the threshold value of the rules is higher than the designated interest measure Finally, the algorithm is proved that it is effective in the data prediction on the power system of a small satellite  Acknowledge  This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation \(No.50705005\d 863 project 2007AA04Z431              Association Rules Support 002  002 Confidence 002  002  Interest 057002 ->063010 254040 ->063010 057002  254040 ->063010 057002  170105 ->063010 057002  254060 ->063010 057002  170110 ->063010 057002  170020 ->063010 170120  254040 ->063010 170120  254025 ->063003 170115  254060 ->063010 057002  170105  254040 ->063010 057002  170120  254040 ->063010 Sup=55 Sup=34 Sup=25 Sup=21 Sup=19 Sup=15 Sup=13 Sup=11 Sup=7 Sup=7 Sup=10 Sup=9 Conf=53.3981 Conf=50 Conf=71.4286 Conf=52.5 Conf=55.8824 Conf=53.5714 Conf=52 Conf=68.75 Conf=77.7778 Conf=50 Conf=66.6667 Conf=75 8.33 8.33 20.00 20.00 0.37 0.37 22.73 22.73 0.42 0.42 1.00 1.00 Association Rules Support 002  002 Confidence 002  002  Interest 057002  254060 -> - 063010 057002  170110 -> - 063010 170120  254025 -> - 063003 170115  254060 -> - 063010 Sup=19 Sup=15 Sup=7 Sup=7 Conf=55.8824 Conf=53.5714 Conf=77.7778 Conf=50 0.0813 99.5 49 0.995 Table 4-1.
