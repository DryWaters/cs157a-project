Since it can discern and respond to the hostile behavior of the computer and network resource, it is a hot area for research network security nowadays. Data mining technology is applied to the network intrusion detection, and Precision of the detection will be improved by the superiority of data mining. In this paper, there is an example running to contract two algorithms. The result is that the fuzzy rule mining algorithm is more convenient than Apriori algorithm to mine mass network log database Keywords-data mining 002 association rule 002 intrusion detection 002 algorithm 000\003 I  T HE DEVELOPING BACKGROUND OF ASSOCIATE RULES MINING ALGORITHM  With the popularity of network, more and more people begin to accept Network and use it. They obtain and exchange their needing knowledge and information and issue information through network. At the same time, the safety problem is getting more and more people's attention. The process of transmitting information conceals latent danger of being letting out The rapid growth and developing hacker technology makes the host more easily be attacked. If the user can distinguish whether the visit of unknown hacker or unknown host to user's host is normal or abnormal visit the user can take the measure to avoid the host being attacked by hacker or unknown hosts. So, to figure out whether the system is attacked and give the corresponding measure seems extremely important. The invading detection is another new safety protection technology after the traditional safety protection measures like: firewall, date code etc, which functions to identity and response the evil action of network. The study of the invading detection is foundation to further study network safety problem, and assurance and premise of solving network safety problem. With the development of information times, the data amount is increasing rapidly in our daily life. The staff management of the companies, the sales performance of Retail Industry, the information management of bank account, the catching of network data, etc, all this shows the rapid growth of date amount. The data mining was developed in this background, once it came into being, it developed quickly. At the moment the data mining technology is still a new-tech. Within short tens years its application has involved into a lot of field as bank, retail sales, customers management, search engine and network safety Associate rules mining is one very common used method, with Associate rules mining, the high credited more meaningful rules can be abstracted from big data storage with a lot of data, so as to attain the goal of data mining and data obtaining. According to the variety of attribute getting, associate rules mining can be divided into Boolean Associate rules and Multi-valued Attribute associate rules. In Multi-valued Attribute associate rules mining the attributes values is divided into different spaces; and the precision division of the spaces can cause the contrast of the spaces border, so as to cause the info of the of the bordering be lost . So we lead in the fuzzy set theory, change multi-valued attribute into fuzzy interval, so as to make the transition between intervals smooth, and reduce the information loss phenomenon between intervals. So, for the database of Multi-valued attribute, we can obtain more and more meaningful rules using method of fuzzification to the attribute

II  A SSOCIATE RULES  APPLICATION IN INVADING DETECTION  To assure the invading detection system certain degree's intelligence is the people’s long-time pursue There are already several technology applied into it like: the data mining method of choosing useful data with certain intelligent system from big amount data the genetic evolution algorithm of individual survival of the fittest coping creatures' evolution; the Neural Networks of self- study. Self-fitting ability and even tolerate the technology of serving in invasion on the network of avoiding the invading virus coping the human's immune system. All these, having no doubt offer better foundation and option. However as the system's main invading prototype is stable, it is only possible to enlarge through human method, and can't make right judge to big amount of invading action without invading prototype so as to cause False Negatives In order to overcome the shortage of the traditional method mentioned above, the invading detection system of cooperating mining technology appears ,and associate rules is one of the most important and fundamental method. As the strong tool analyzing involving relations among data, the Associate Rules has shown outstanding priority in mould identifying and classifying and forecasting in recent years. Through continuous study, IDS can find the rules from the big amount complicated data of unknown moulds; the study shows the Associate Rules fits the requirements of the invading detection system in conception and dealing method There three shortages of leading the traditional Associate Rules “Apriori algorithm” into invading detection system field, one is it produce a lot of preelected item set, specially the 2-itemset. If there is 1000 continuous 1-itemsets, then it will produce 100000 order of magnitude's pre-elected 2-itemset. The database check a very big pre-elected groups through pattern matching, this is very hard to do for the invading detection big amount data. Second it needs to repeating scanning database, if repeating item sets figures is very big ,then it will repeat the scanning many more times, This to the big data of invading detecting database, the time needed is very much Thirdly, this algorithm believes each items of the database is equally important, but in fact, each items in invading detecting does not equal important, we often consider the more influential items and ignore the less influential items. Additionally, with the time goes by and mutation of attacking moulds, the Associate Rules caused by longer time's affairs will obsolete, and the Associate Rules caused by the affair with shorter intervals has though not much support, but reflect the new attacking trend. The data which grows with time in Auditing data getting more and more, and caused the so-called time-effect problem, that is the long term data have less influence III  T HE E XPERIMENT OF USING DATA MINING METHOD TO INVADING DETECTING  This article will carry out abnormal detecting experiment based on network using fuzzy associate rules mining and Apriori algorithm, and comparing analyzing. The experimental data come from http://iriscs.uml.edu:8080 We downloaded 3 groups network data on flows of tcpdump. And base stands for normal network data on flows, net1 contains network on flows of IP spoofing attacking, in which the intruder tries to obtain access to long distance host through guessing the IP serial number, net2 contains network on flows of copying port, attacking, scanning, in which the intruder tries to collect the associate network host and the service information it offers A  The pretreatment of experimental data The data is tcpdump type, tcpdump is the programs working at gateway, the gateway connects inner net and outer net, so it can obtain all packet data network connecting with outer net and all broadcasting packet data network, and only intercept the Header of message without the contents of the data segment. Here is a classifying tcpdump data  15:10 41.535855 2.0.256.256.2593>9.0.256.256 80 ack 1163562564 win 16384 15:10 41.536404 2.0.256.256.1826>7.0.256.256 27383 ack 0 win 16384 15:10 41.539437 7.0.256.256.27383>2.0.256.256 1826 51 2 1024\(512\ 1 win 4096 15:10 41.539562 4.0.256.256.80>2.0.256.256 2608 ack 438464421 win 9112 \(DF 15:10 41.541234 2.0.256.256.4305>6.0.256.256 119 P 1 38\(37\ ack 13 win 4096 15:10 41.542496 2.0.256.256.1826>7.0.256.256 27383 ack 1024 win 16384

Tcpdump data output like table 1 TABLE I   T CPDUMP DATA OUTPUT  TimeStramp Start time to connect Src Source IP address Des Destination IP address SrcPort Source port DesPort Destination port Seq Sequence number Ack acknowledgement number  Data mining method dealing goals are commonly the database or structured data, but tcpump data can't use data mining method directly, so we must pretreatment with it. In traditional tcpdump there is many memos reflecting the same connection, we can combine many messages belonging to the same connection to one connection, one memo. So as to reduce the redundant rules caused in knowledge mining. So we can combine the data compact belonging to the same connections to one connecting memo through scanning every line data in tcpdump document. That is we make this operation to every TCP connection program: \(1\ Check to see if it connects normally, if not, record the error. \(2\ Detecting all the packet data network and ACK packet in data transmitting process, recording byte count coming from goal host. \(3\In the process of ending , check the state of ending. For the connection of UDP, as UDP is agreement without connections, so it is easy to deal with, you can only take every packet as one connection memo B  Rules mining and result comparison After the pretreatment with the data to traditional tcpdump data, we can use the algorithm method of the former article to mine the network log database. First divide the base document to 2 parts, 80 percents used to train data, 20 percent used to test data. After Associate Rules mining to training data, a lot of meaningless rules appeared, like  SND414<-REV 103 STATESF \(4%,65 SRC_ORT2630<-SND414\(3%, 62  The SND414 stands for the sponsor obtained 414 bytes, REV103 stands for that sponsor obtain 103 bytes SRC_ORT2630 stands for connecting Source Port is 2630, STATESF stands for ending state is SF, These data can be obtained through checking connecting memos GiveBytes GetBytes SrcPort, StatusConn Apparently, the outputting bytes has nothing to do with source port, the receiving bytes has nothing to do with ending state, in order to avoid producing a lot of useless rules, so we make further simplifying to the experimental data's attributes, only keep the source address, source port, destination address, goal port and connecting state 5 attributes to associate rules mining Using fuzzy associate rules mining algorithm and Apriori algorithm to rules mining, suppose the support degree is s=4%, credit degree is c=80%, the mining to 80% data and 20% data of the base file and also net1 document and net2 document. The rules group we get are base80.rul, base20.rul, netl.rul, net2.rul, Compared base80.ru1with base20.rul, and netl.rul, net2.ru, we can find: Each rules obtained through associate rules mining reflect a special action customs of network, but the rules groups contains all actions features which meet supposed threshold value, so the similarity of rules groups reflects the similarity degree of different action customs among rule groups. Analyzing from theory 80% of base data groups which is training data and 20 of base data groups which is testing data rule groups reflect normal action network on flows. So after mining the obtained similar and same rules are a lot, so as to the similarity between the two rule groups is very high. But the network on flows data which contains invading action data in net1 and net2 whose rules groups reflects the abnormal case. Compared the rules obtained from net1and net2 with base80.rul, the same rules are kind of small, so the similarity between rule group is small Measured with the evaluation parameters mentioned above, we can get the comparison result like table 2 TABLE II   T CPDUMP DATA OUTPUT  Algorithm  The number of rules false rate missing rate Running time Apriori  26377 36.2 12.8  135s Fuzzy associate rules mining  18036 20.3 9.2  82s  The test result shows, the similarity of Apriori algorithm and training data is low, but the similarity between fuzzy associate rules mining algorithm and training data is a little high. From the number of rules obtained, we can see the number of rules obtained based on fuzzy associate rules algorithm is smaller and the time spent on it is also short , but the  false positive rate and rate of missing report is lower than Apriori algorithm. Apparently, this is the result of the work of the improved support and degree of confidence's genes

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
