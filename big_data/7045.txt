Traceability ReARMed Joern David Maximilian Koegel Helmut Naughton Jonas Helming Technical University Munich Institute of Computer Science  I1 D-85748 Garching Germany f david koegel naughton helming g in.tum.de Abstract Traceability links connect artifacts in software engineering models to allow tracing in a variety of use cases Common to any of these use cases is that one can easily 002nd related artifacts by following these links Traceability links can signi\002cantly reduce the risk and cost of change in a software development project However 002nding creating and maintaining these links is costly in most cases In any real-world project of signi\002cant size the creation and maintenance of traceability links requires tool support In this paper we propose a novel approach to support the automation of traceability link recovery based on Association Rule Mining and operation-based change tracking Traceability link recovery is the activity of 002nding missing or lost traceability links Our approach automatically generates a list of candidate links based on the project history along with a score of support and con\002dence for every candidate link We transformed the data from an operationbased change tracking system to sets of frequent items which serve as input for Association Rule Mining ARM We applied our approach to data from a software development project with more than 40 developers and assessed the quality of the candidate links in interviews 1 Motivation Traceability is an important property of any software model and can be de\002ned as follows Software artifact traceability is the ability to describe and follow the life of an artifact requirements code tests models reports plans etc developed during the software life cycle in both forward and backward directions e.g from requirements to the modules of the software architecture and the code components implementing them and vice-versa 18 Missing support for traceability has been recognized as a major cause for project overruns and failures 16 Due to the iterative nature of software development the manual detection and maintenance of traceability links has to be performed frequently and is costly The need for tools to support 002nding and maintaining traceability links is widely recognized in academia 25 21 22 Existing approaches for recovering traceability links are based on content and rely on the hypothesis that related artifacts are also related in content Traceability links can therefore only be found if the two artifacts that are to be linked have similar content This is a major drawback and either results in many false positives if the content similarity threshold is low or in many false negatives if it is high During the case study presented in section 5 we also observed that related artifacts must not be similar in their content at all especially if the content is sparse and the model is still under development De Lucia et al e xplicitly suggest to solv e the limitations of content-based approaches by complementing them with other approaches In this paper we propose a novel approach to traceability link recovery called ReARM  Re covery of traceability links based on A ssociation R ule M ining ReARM does not rely on content similarity but on the history of a software model overcoming the limitations of content-based approaches Especially in models under de v elopment where content may still be sparse content-based similarity is not an appropriate indicator for related artifacts By recovering links from the previous change and navigation behavior on the model the candidate links are restricted to relevant parts of the model and to links that would have been of use in the past Our approach is also applicable to uni\002ed models which incorporate a broader range of software engineering artifacts than previous software models Further ReARM can be used in addition to existing content-based approaches completing their results with links that are not related in content but according to their change history

2 Related Work For tool-supported traceability link recovery there are two types of approaches in general content-based and non content-based ones Several content-based approaches make use of methods from Information Retrieval IR such as Latent Semantic Indexing LSI deriving traceability link candidates from content similarity Non content-based approaches often use data mining techniques such as Association Rule Mining ARM to discover traceability links symbolically Content-based Approaches The majority of existing approaches is based on content Several content-based approaches employ basic matching techniques as done by Murphy et al where re gular e xpressions and naming conventions are leveraged to map the developer's model to the source model using the re\003ection model technique The tool QuaTrace by Maletic et al inte grates the commercial tools RequisitePro and Rhapsody to provide traceable requirements using guidelines during document creation and name matching Zisman et also use syntactical matching of related terms in requirements and in the source code of the system All these approaches depend on naming conventions and adherence to guidelines As mentioned before many content-based approaches are based on information retrieval methods According to Antoniol et al the probabilistic model and the v ector space model from information retrieval are both suitable for traceability recovery and show similar performance in this 002eld These methods require a prior stemming step i.e the reduction of words in a text to their corresponding stems to make comparisons easier Settimi et al utilize the v ector space model to trace requirements to UML artifacts and code In Hayes et al introduce the RETR O tool which utilizes an improved vector space model technique as well as latent semantic indexing as an extension of the vector space model David proposes a recommendation system which is based on a recurrent neural network as well as on LSI to predict likely further changes  given a set of already changed software artifacts Cleland-Huang et al int roduce three strate gies for improving probabilistic retrieval algorithms i.e hierarchical enhancement clustering enhancement and graph pruning enhancement Richardson and Green use a method called surface traceability in which small perturbations are made and the corresponding changes are observed to automatically discover traceability links between the speci\002cation and parts of a program  generated from this speci\002cation using program synthesis While this technique is interesting for generated programs it was not developed for traceability discovery in manually coded programs Maletic and Marcus mak e use of latent semantic indexing showing that latent semantic indexing performs better than vector space or probabilistic models and does not rely on stemming either Maletic et al e xtend the latent semantic indexing approach by creating a formal hypertext model for link recovery and maintenance of the conformance of the links over time Lormans and van Deursen reconstruct links between requirements on the one side and design artifacts and test case speci\002cations on the other side also using latent semantic indexing They discuss two possible link selection strategies which include to apply a 1-dimensional as well as a 2-dimensional 002lter to the term-document matrix De Lucia et al created an artifact management system with traceability recovery based on latent semantic indexing called ADAMS They conclude that in order to go beyond the limitations of information retrieval methods a combination with syntaxbased approaches would be necessary Summing up the existing approaches in the 002eld of traceability link discovery content-based approaches mainly use information retrieval methods based on the vector space model such as LSI These techniques rely on static similarity between different development artifacts entity-centric Sparse or missing artifact contents imply a need for non content-based approaches such as syntax-based analysis or association rule mining These methods often address traceability from an activity-centric point of view discovering traceability links from the traces of different development activities Non Content-based Approaches The CAESAR approach developed by Gall et al attempts to measure the coupling of multiple releases of a system  based on empirical analysis Using a product release database they identify change patterns using change sequence analysis and change report analysis and employ these patterns to detect coupling between subsystems Egyed and Gr  unbacher utilize a graph of nodes which can be built by observing the classes and methods used while testing a scenario Trace analysis is then performed by iteratively manipulating this graph Gall et al e xploit CVS Concurrent V ersions System data by quantitative analysis change sequence analysis and relation analysis to analyze software evolution and to display change behavior CVS data is also the basis for the work of Ying et al who utilize association rule mining to determine change patterns from the change history of the CVS repository They exploit this information to recommend possibly relevant artifacts to the programmer ROSE as presented in Zimmermann et al also mak es use of association rule mining on a CVS repository to predict future changes to reveal the coupling of entities and to prevent errors occurring due to the incompleteness of changes Both approaches operate on the source code only Non-content based approaches traditionally determine change patterns based on the changes to a CVS-like repos

itory Change-impact mining on a uni\002ed model using a broader range of software engineering artifacts as described in section 3.1 can help to improve these approaches 3 Prerequisites of the ReARM Approach In this section we will introduce prerequisites for our approach The traceability links we recover are instances of a uni\002ed model that combines models from different domains such as UML models rationale models or schedules In section 3.1 we describe the idea of a uni\002ed model and de\002ne its terminology Since we reco v er traceability links from the history of the models our approach is based on Software Con\002guration Management SCM more speci\002cally on a operation-based versioning system section 3.2  Finally  we introduce association rule mining as the data mining technique used to process the history data section 3.3 3.1 Uni\014ed Model In software engineering a model can describe the system under development on different levels of abstraction at different points in time and from different points of view Typically in a software development life-cycle many models of the system under development are produced These models range from requirements models to class models of the entities involved in the system However models in a software development project may also build an abstraction of the software development project itself in terms of the organization resources or schedules Many management artifacts fall into this category such as work breakdown structures or organizational charts We therefore de\002ne the term system model as the entirety of models describing the system under development while the project model is the entirety of models describing the development project itself Models de\002ne model elements and links in the terminology of a uni\002ed model they represent an aggregation of model elements and model links Model elements are nodes that have a certain number of attributes of a certain type For example in a UML class model there are class nodes including but not limited to the attributes name  isAbstract  and package  The requirements model contains requirement nodes with attributes such as stakeholder or priority  Model links de\002ne the connections that are valid among nodes In the UML class model example links include association  aggregation  and composition links in the requirements model links might specify a re\014ningRequirements relation Essentially all instances of models are graphs with instances of model elements as nodes and instances of links as edges Since several models can describe the same system under development it is often useful to add additional links connecting elements of these different models For example it can be essential to link a requirement from a requirement model with a use case from a use case model to express that the use case is describing the requirement in greater detail A uni\002ed model de\002nes models with their model elements and links among the model elements from the same or different models 3.2 Operation-based Change Tracking Commonly instances of a model are stored in a Software Con\002guration Management SCM system Our approach is based on the history provided by an SCM system which serves as input for the association rule mining algorithm For the ReARM approach we need to analyze the changes that were performed on the granularity of model elements and links Most existing SCM systems however provide data about the evolution of a model on the granularity of 002les We therefore rely on the SCM system presented in  and implemented in Sysiphus 8 This SCM system works in an operation-based way and provides change information on the granularity of model elements and their attributes Each change is called an operation and describes the attribute that was changed the respective model element and the old and new value of the attribute All model elements also contain reader information that is information about the time a user has last read the element if at all Since reading a model element will update its reader information reading a model element is also recorded as a change which we will exploit in the following Figure 1 Instance of a version graph The SCM system records the history of an instance of a uni\002ed model in a version graph Figure 1 shows an instance of a version graph Each instance of Version represents a project state having a predecessor and a successor Version instance Modifying version version1 creates version version2  The modi\002cations on the model that occurred in version1 transforming it into version2 are represented by the instance changesFrom1To2 of the association class ChangePackage  From a technical point of view we

say applying changesFrom1To2 to version1 results in version2  The ChangePackage changesFrom1To2 is a composite of three ModelOperation instances The ModelOperation linkAtoB is an operation that was performed on the model between version1 and version2  It describes the creation of a link between two model elements A and B  where A is a requirement and B is a use case On the basis of this change tracking infrastructure the PAUSE framework w as constructed It pro vides access to project iterators returning the project state and the changes applied to the project on any day of the project lifecycle 3.3 Association Rule Mining Association rule mining ARM is a data mining technique usually applied to large databases of sets of cooccurring items The technique was 002rst introduced by Argawal Imielinski and Swami who used it for mark et basket analysis Its goal is to discover buying patterns of the form  85 of the purchases including diapers also included beer  Such probabilistic rules can then be used for decision support systems regarding price promotion or store layout Figure 2 shows the functionality of ARM from a blackbox perspective receiving itemsets as input and providing discovered rules as output Figure 2 Blackbox view of association rule mining with generic input and output representation that is applicable to many different domains and their problems Recently association rule mining has also been applied to software engineering One contribution was made by Zimmermann and his colleagues who mined version histories to guide software changes When a de v eloper works on a programming task relevant software artifacts such as documents source code multimedia 002les etc that might require corresponding changes can be proactively recommended Programmers who changed these artifacts also changed   In this paper we also use an association rule mining technique based on the apriori algorithm W e de\002ne the fundamental concepts of association rule mining by the following terminology 017 Items I  f i 1  i 2      i m g  The set of all existing items each represented by a unique symbol 017 Itemset X 022 I  A subset of the globally available items e.g a shopping cart of goods to be bought For facilitating the mining process the items are ordered lexicographically  x 1  x 2      x n  with x 1 024 x 2 024    024 x n  A k itemset is an itemset containing k items x 1      x k  017 Transaction T   tid X   Each transaction is a 2tuple consisting of a tid  which is simply an identi\002er in form of a natural number and an itemset X  017 Database D  f T 1  T 2      T n g  A database is the collection of transactions which were captured and stored in a transaction table  tid X   017 The cover of an itemset X is a set of identi\002ers denominating the transactions that contain X  cover  X   f tid j  tid Y  2 D Y 022 X g  017 The frequency of an itemset X in the database D is the probability of its occurrence within a transaction T 2 D  f req  X   support  X  j D j  P  X   where support  X   j cover  X  j  017 Itemsets X 2 D that satisfy a given frequency threshold t  f req  X  025 t 2 0    are of special interest The concrete values of these terms are typically measured by counting the entries of a transaction database which represents the dataset to be analyzed ARM works upon unordered sets and not upon ordered sequences which is a fundamental premise and constraint of this technique Thus order-sensitive sequences such as words of a grammar cannot be represented without loss of information The ARM process consists of two subsequent steps 002rst all frequent itemsets in the database have to be discovered In the second step the actual association rules are derived from the set of frequent itemsets 1 Mining of Frequent Itemsets  There are 000 j I j k 001 many k itemsets that all have to be checked for minimum support in case of a naive approach to itemset mining Thus the worst case costs sum up to O  P j I j k 1 000 j I j k 001   O 2 j I j   2 Association Rule Mining  017 An association rule is an implication of the form X  Y  X  Y    X is the rule's body  Y is the head  017 The support of an association rule A 021 X  Y is computed based on the support of frequent itemsets supp  A   supp  X  Y   017 The con\002dence of an association rule A 021 X  Y is de\002ned as conf  A   supp  X  Y  supp  X   The con\002dence can also be interpreted as condi

rule mining step requires a set of frequent itemsets as input which is the output of step 1 Based on the discovered k itemsets which are frequent in the underlying database association rules A of the form A   Y  X 000 Y  are computed Only rules with the desired minimal con\002dence are considered The con\002dence conf  A  can be calculated 8 Y 032 X in the following simple way conf  A   supp  Y

g  i 2 f 1  2      k g regarding its support a total of 2 m 000 1 evaluations a dynamic programming approach is carried out This technique is known as the apriori algorithm for ARM which exploits a monotony property  The monotony property states that all supersets X 0 of an itemset X  X 032 X 0  cannot be frequent if X is not frequent This property narrows the search space signi\002cantly and thus speeds up the computation of frequent itemsets The constrained search space corresponds to the set of candidate itemsets  whose support has to be computed Since the candidate generation can be additionally pruned by discarding those candidates not contained in the transaction database the whole ARM algorithm is very fast magnitude of several seconds for up to several hundred thousands of itemsets which additionally quali\002es this technique for traceability link discovery 4 Traceability Link Discovery Approach In the ReARM approach we apply association rule mining ARM to the history and therefore also to the user navigation traces of software models to recover traceability links Our main contribution is the combination of ARM and operation-based change tracking as well as their application to recover traceability links Also we apply ReARM to a broad set of artifacts from a uni\002ed model cf section 3.1 Thereby we only rely on the history of the models not on the content of any model element overcoming the limitations of content-based approaches Especially in models under development where content may still be sparse content-based similarity is not an appropriate indicator for related artifacts By recovering links from the previous change and navigation behavior on the model the candidate links are restricted to relevant parts of the model and to links that would have been of use in the past As opposed to previous approaches ReARM exploits the history of read-activities upon model elements which is more 002ne-grained than only mining the 002le-based version histories provided by the respective versioning system Our hypothesis is that reading one or several artifacts often represents the initial point for a user to change related artifacts The initial artifacts do not necessarily have to be changed in order to cause an intraor inter-model change since in many cases reading them within the same session already reminds the user of related changes to be carried out In the following we describe our approach to recover traceability links presenting a short overview of the recovery process and then describing the details of each step Figure 3 shows an overview over the process that consists of three major steps session mining read-read partitioning and association rule mining As outlined in section 3.2 the history of a model instance is recorded in change packages Our 002rst step is to cluster the change packages into sessions per author A session is a list of change packages from one author where the time between two consecutive change packages remains below a given threshold the session timeout In a further step certain changes are 002ltered from the sessions e.g those that relate to deleted elements and thus are useless Each session represents a set of model operations which is partitioned according to a read-read heuristic in the second step Finally the association rule mining procedure results in a set of rules Each rule is given by a set of model elements on the left hand side and a set of model elements on the right hand side of the rule Each rule represents a candidate for a traceability link which is annotated with a con\002dence and a support value Figure 3 Coarse-grained work 003ow of the ReARM traceability link discovery approach Step 1 Session Mining The history of a model instance consists of a list of change packages representing all changes that ever occurred on this model instance Each change package is a list of model operations Each change package was created by exactly one author and was committed at a given point in time We de\002ne a session as a list of model operations from one author so that the period of time in between two succeeding change packages is within a given session timeout  This way we are able to transform the list of change packages into a list of sessions If two commits from one author occur within a few minutes or even seconds we observed that the authors are working on similar modeling tasks in most cases In an ideal scenario a 
344 


commit would be equal to a session and each author would commit only after and also immediately after completing one modeling task The session timeout represents a degree of freedom in this step thus we vary this parameter in our evaluation Step 2 Read-Read Partitioning In the second step we need to 002lter the model operations in the sessions to avoid some unwanted results As we are only able to 002nd traceability links between existing elements we 002lter all model operations referring to deleted elements Additionally we remove changes that refer to administrative model elements such as project con\002guration data On every read of a model element its reader information is updated and recorded as a change Based on the hypothesis that users trace artifacts even if they are not connected by a link we 002lter the changes to reader information changes Thereby we model the navigation of a traceability link by frequent and sequential reader information changes on model elements to be linked As input for ARM we use a set of tuples of model elements Each pair of succeeding reader information changes on two model elements that are not yet linked represents such a tuple within the session timeframe In the case a traceability link is absent the user may take several approaches to 002nd the correct element therefore we also include transitive links up to a certain depth transitivitydepth In other words for a 002xed model element we generate n pairs with the n succeeding elements that were read  not only with the direct successor As result of step 2 we obtain a set of tuples of model elements that were read in sequence for each session obtained from step 1 Step 3 Association Rule Mining In the 002nal preprocessing step the two model elements from each tuple are joined to get one itemset The collection of all of these itemsets is fed into the ARM mechanism as a set of sets Before starting the mining process the two parameters support and con\002dence are chosen e.g minSupp  0  015 and minConf  0  7  which means that the items that take part in an association rule occur in at least 1.5 of all itemsets The more itemsets are contained in the underlying database the lower the minSupp value has to be chosen since otherwise very few association rules would be found Now consider the association rule A   X  Y   where supp  X  Y  025 minSupp frequent itemset The value minConf is the minimal fraction of itemsets here 70 that also contain the elements of itemset Y  given that they already contain those of itemset X  more formally conf  A   supp  X  Y  supp  Y  025 minConf  Finally the ARM algorithm returns a set of rules f A 1      A n g  each of them ful\002lling the minConf constraint Since our input only contained tuples the cardinality is two for each A i  We only keep those rules which point from the 002rst element to the second element in any tuple In other words we discard those rules whose left hand side body as well as right hand side head are never the 002rst or second element in a tuple respectively This way we obtain rules with the following meaning Reading the model element on the left hand side often results in reading the model element on the right hand side Each rule represents one traceability link candidate Each candidate is annotated with a support and a con\002dence value from ARM cf section 3.3 In the following evaluation we discuss several instances of links discovered by the ARM mechanism and present the quantitative results of the ReARM approach within an industrial case study 5 Evaluation We evaluated the ReARM approach within a case study on a project named DOLLI Distributed Online Logistics and Location Infrastructure at a major European Airport The objective of the DOLLI project was to improve the airport's existing tracking and locating capabilities and to integrate all available location data into a central database Luggage tracking and dispatching of service personal as well as a 3D visualization of the aggregated data were developed More than 40 developers worked on the project for about 002ve months All modeling was performed in the Sysiphus CASE tool This resulted in a comprehensi v e project model consisting of about 15.000 model elements and a history of over 53.000 versions Before presenting the quantitative results of our evaluation we give concrete examples of link candidates generated by ReARM based on the history of the DOLLI project One of the traceability link types within the system model points from use cases to UML classes and to UML class diagrams respectively which are an aggregation of classes We discovered a link from an use case describing the recording of object movements on the airport to a class diagram representing the entity model of trackable objects and their location data This link allows to update the entity model in case the use case is changed or to trace from the use case to the classes in order to get a more detailed view on the system While the use case contains only the short text The user should have the possibility to record the movement of objects for short periods of his/her absence so that he/she can plot them at a later time Not available for normal employees the class diagram contains many classes over 20 most of them only containing a class name such as Car  which is a subtype of trackable objects For a content-based approach it is likely to be dif\002cult to relate the use case with the diagram since content is sparse in both entities and the only relationship between them is that all the objects in the diagram are movable In the uni\002ed model an ActionItem dealing with imple 
345 


mentation can be linked to the requirements from the system model which it partially implements We recovered one instance of this link type The task is about the implementation of a timeout detection for an RFID reader antenna The functional requirement is about the detection of RFID tags Without the suggested link a project manager cannot trace from the requirement to the tasks that are still open and that refer to this requirement The content of the action item is only Implement antenna timeout detection while the content of the requirement is Detection of RFID tag For a content-based approach there is hardly any relation detectable using only this sparse information For the quantitative part of our evaluation we ran the link recovery with different parameters to optimize the results The best result generated by a run with a session timeout of 20 minutes a transitivity-depth of 10 and support as well as con\002dence thresholds of 1.5E-3 and 30 respectively is shown in table 1 The table lists source and target element types and the number of links in forward and backward direction of these link candidates as well as a total count for each link type Although we consider the links to be bidirectional it is interesting to see in which direction they were discovered since this also implies the most frequent direction of usage Links with only few instances were aggregated into classes such as System Model Element and Project Model Element see 3.1 Unexpectedly many of the traceability links originate from or point to elements of the Project Model  We would have expected more links within the system model especially from requirements to use cases By examining the input data we 002gured out that there are only few navigation instances from requirements to use cases and vice versa The requirement and use case model are not consistent with each other There are requirements that are not required for any use case in other words use cases are missing By contrast there are use cases that are not re\003ected in the requirements We discovered the reason for this mismatch by means of the conducted interviews While some of the teams worked mostly with use cases other teams relied on requirements as primary representation for the customer's requirements Therefore there has been hardly any navigation from requirements to use cases On the other hand it was a prerequisite from project management to report on the completion of the system in terms of open tasks This is probably the reason for many navigation instances from Project Model to System Model  resulting in many recovered links in this segment This is also re\003ected in the resulting model in which almost 50 of the action items are related to a requirement but less than 10 of the requirements are linked to use cases In summary 22 of the recovered links belong to the system model 36 point from the system model to the project model and 42 belong to the project model From these results we conclude that our approach is very sensitive to the LinkSourceType LinkTargetType Fwd Bwd Total Action Item Functional Requirement 38 17 55 Action Item System Model Element 6 0 6 Action

denotes the number of traceability links in forward/backward direction actual usage of the model We can only derive traceability links which are frequently used This may sound like a disadvantage but indeed it is an advantage we only discover traceability links which would have been used frequently To assess the quality of the recovered links we interviewed several project participants The test set was randomly selected from all candidate links From a total of 43 links 5 links were rejected For 12 links the probands could not tell whether these actually represent traceability links The remaining 26 links were accepted In the overall experiment the probands considered more than 60 of the candidates as meaningful traceability links even when discarding the links the probands were not sure about The problem with evaluating the overall quality of our approach is that by design the overall number of traceability links is unknown and very hard to estimate Nevertheless any recovered traceability link represents value added for the respective development project unless the effort to review the recommended candidate links is overwhelming Therefore the number of recommended candidate links can be controlled via the mining parameters support and con\002dence Since it is likely that a higher con\002dence value of an association rule implies a higher applicability of the corresponding traceability link we can cut down the result size by increasing the minimal con\002dence Furthermore a higher support value implies a higher applicability of the discovered rule within the space of all model elements

6 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper we proposed a novel approach called ReARM for discovering traceability links based on association rule mining and operation-based change tracking Our approach operates on a broad set of artifacts as part of a uni\002ed model including UML models and project management models such as schedules In contrast to contentbased approaches we do not only consider the model at a certain point in time but we take its history into account and thereby also the activity of the developers working on the model activity-centric This results in two main advantages First content-based approaches such as similarity search using latent semantic indexing LSI do not address traceability as an activity that is carried out by developers in a software project but only consider their static work products such as requirement documents or use case descriptions Recovered links are not rated by frequency of use and might thus of limited interest for the actual activities performed in a speci\002c software development project Second since we do not rely on content we can discover links even in situations where content is sparse or the involved artifacts are not related in content but nevertheless require a traceability link These situations often occur when a model is still under development and not yet complete correct nor consistent Our approach can be used in addition to existing content-based approaches completing their results with links that are not related in content but according to their change history We applied the ReARM approach to the artifacts generated by an industrial project in order to show its feasibility and to evaluate the link recovery results We conclude that our approach represents a useful alternative to contentbased approaches especially in situations where these approaches fail Traceability links that do not result from similarity in content and links among artifacts with sparse content The ReARM approach is not limited to traceability link recovery and also shows a potential for other applications In future work we will apply our technique to change impact analysis scenarios Cost and time metrics based on the result of ReARM can be used to quantify the impact of a change which in turn may support a go/no-go decision of the project's change committee References  R Agra w al T

hour after the min_sup becomes smaller than 0.4. However the MPFCI algorithm can find all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets efficiently. This explains that the computational cost of directly testing frequent closed probability increases sharply with the increase of the number of probabilistic frequent itemsets \(The number increases w.r.t the increase of min_sup\milar results can be found in Fig. 5\(b\which also reports comparison of running time in T20I10D30KP40 dataset. Hence, it is inefficien t to directly check frequent closed probabilities of all probabilistic frequent itemsets which can be obtain by existing solution, such as TODIS [22  Next, we focus on the test of effectiveness of different pruning strategies Effect of min_sup in MPFCI We firstly investigated the running time of five compared algorithms w.r.t. the minimum support, min_sup. Fig. 6\(a\ shows the running time of all algorithms while min_sup changes from 0.2 to 0.6 in Mushroom dataset. When min_sup decreases, we observe that the running time of all the algorithms goes up due to the number of probabilistic frequent itemsets increases. However we find that the growth speed of MPFCI is the lowest due to all pruning methods it employed. We also find that MPFCINoCH has the similar running time with that of MPFCI. This indicates that the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound pruning contributes less to reduce the total running time compared to other pruning methods. In addition, MPFCI-NoBound is the slowest algorithm. In particular the running time of MPFCINoBound is larger than 1 hour when min_sup is smaller 0.3 Similar results can be found in Fig. 6\(b\hich reports the running time of all algorithms in T20I10D30KP40  dataset Effect of pfct in MPFCI We continue to test the running time of five compared algorithms with varying the probabilistic frequent closed threshold, pfct in two different b\, we can obverse that MPFCI is always the fastest algorithm. With regards to the change of pfct, the running time of all algorithms remains approximately the same. Thus, in tuple-model uncertain transaction database we can discover that the influence of probabilistic frequent closed threshold will be smaller than that of min_sup to the total running time. Meanwhile, MPFCI is the fastest algorithm and MPFCI-NoBound is still the slowest one, which indicates that the probabilistic bound pruning is more effective than other pruning methods  a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 5 Efficiency Comparison between MPFCI and Naïve  a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 6 Running time w.r.t min_sup    a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 7 Running time w.r.t pfct   a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 8 Running time w.r.t 0010   a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 9 Running time w.r.t 001  Effect of 000H 000H in MPFCI In this part, we mainly analyse the influence of the relative tolerance error  0010 to the running time in Fig. 8 \(a\\(b\ With the change of 0010 we can observe: 1 four algorithms, MPFCI, MPFCI-NoCH, MPFCI-NoSuper and MPFCI-NoSub, keep a steady running time. 2\e algorithm of MPFCI-NoBound becomes slower clearly when 0010  becomes lower. In addition, the above observations also verify the time complexity analysis of the approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability. Because the MPFCI-NoBound algorithm does not use any probabilistic bound pruning to reduce redundant computation for frequent closed probability, we have to compute closed probabilities of all itemsets which cannot be removed by other pruning methods.  Please note that the time complexity of our approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability is 2 4 ln\(2       Ok UTD 000G\000H Moreover, the running time of approximation algorithm will increase 2 1   O 000H with the decreasing of 0010 Thus, the decreasing of 000H causes more influence to the running time of the MPFCI-NoBound

algorithm. Moreover, other four algorithms utilize the probabilistic bounds pruning, so they can avoid redundant computation of frequent closed probabilities Effect of 000G 000G in MPFCI We finally studied the influence of running time from the probabilistic confidence degree parameter 000G in  Fig. 9 \(a\d \(b\We can find the similar effect with the change of 000H Namely, the MPFCI-NoBound algorithm is also affected greatly by the change of 000G By comparing the results in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we can discover that the influence of 000G on the running time of MPFCINoBound is smaller than the influence of 000H This is because with decreasing of 000G the running time of MPFCI-NoBound about computing frequent closed probability will increase ln\(2   O 000G   B  Compression Quality Evaluation In this subsection, we mainly evaluate the compression quality of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in probabilistic data against that of frequent closed itemsets in exact data. Without loss of gene rality, we test the compression quality under two different di stributions over Mushroom dataset. The first one makes the Mushroom follows Gaussian distribution whose mean is 0.8 and variance is 0.1. The second one follows Gaussian distribu tion whose mean is 0.5 and variance is 0.25 \(Namely, the default set of the Mushroom dataset in our experiments\n addition, we keep same default values of pfct=0.8 000H 0.1, and 000G 0.1 as used in the last subsection We compare the number of itemsets of frequent itemsets for short FI\, frequent closed itemsets \(for short FCI probabilistic frequent itemsets \(for short PFI\, and probabilistic frequent closed itemsets \(for short PFCI\he first two kinds of itemsets are produced by FP-growth algorithm orithm 24] f r o m th e exa ct Mushroom dataset. The PFI and PFCI are generated by TODIS algorithm r alg orithm respecti v e l y   Fig. 10 \(a\hows the comparison of the number of above four kinds of itemsets under the uncertain Mushroom dataset whose mean is 0.8 and variance is 0.1. With min_sup decreasing from 0.3 to 0.1, we observe that the ratio between Number of FCI and Number of FI declines sharply Meanwhile, the ratio between Number of PFCI and Number of PFI also declines quickly. That means the probabilistic frequent closed itemsets over uncertain data have the similar compression effect with frequent closed itemsets in exact data Fig. 10 \(b\ also shows the similar compression result However, we also observe that the compression effect of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in Fig. 10 \(b\is worse than that in Fig. 10 \(a\hat is because Fig. 10 \(b\he smaller mean than Fig. 10 \(a\as the higher variance than Fig. 10 \(a\ The smaller mean and higher variance indicate higher uncertainty, which leads to less number of probabilistic frequent itemsets and probabilistic frequent closed itemsets under same threshold To sum up, above results demonstrate that our definition of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets keeps the good compression property of frequent closed itemsets in exact data  a  Mean  0.8,  Var=0.1                     \(b  Mean  0.5,  Var=0.25 Fig. 10 Compression Quality  w.r.t min_sup  C  Approximation Quality Evaluation In this subsection, we evaluate the approximation quality of our mining algorithm since the problem of computing frequent closed probability has been proven as a #P-Hard problem Because approximation effect of our algorithm is determined by the relative tolerance error 0010 and the probabilistic confidence degree parameter  001 we mainly focus on testing the change of the result set w.r.t the change of 0010 and 001 over our default uncertain Mushroom dataset. We denote the set of the final result as FR and the set of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets as TI. We use precision which equals FR TI FR and recall which equals FR TI TI to measure the approximate effect. Moreover, it is hard to get the set of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets due to #P-hard complexity. Thus, we use the result set when 0010 0.01 and 001 0.01 as true result set Fig. 11 \(a\ows that the change of precision and recall when 0010 increases from 0.05 to 0.3 and 001 equals 0.1. We observe that the recall keeps s teady, but precision decreases with 0010 increasing. Because the number of sampling in the ApproxFCP algorithm equals 2 42 ln n 000H\000G  the number of sampling will decrease significantly with 0010 increasing. Moreover 001  equals 0.1, probabilistic confidence degree is also fixed. Thus the number of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets keeps steady and recall also remain stable. Similarly, Fig. 11 \(b shows the case where 001 increases from 0.05 to 0.3 and 0010  equals 0.1. Because 001 only influences the number of sampling on ln 2  000G times, recall is affected slightly and precision also remains stable. To sum up, above results demonstrate that our approximation algorithm has a good approximation quality  a  Varying 0010 b  Varying 001  Fig. 11 Approximation Quality in Mushroom  D  Algorithm Framework Evaluation In this subsection, we evaluate the efficiencies of the depthfirst search-based and breadth-fi rst search-based strategies Fig. 12\(a\hows the running time of two search solutions while min_sup varies from 0.2 to 0.6 and other parameters are

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
