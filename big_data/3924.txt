When of distribution employed to detect a transient change in distribution Page's test is easy to implement and since it is a GLRT it provides The quickest detection of a change in distributions occurring reliable performance However its application to unknown at unknown time points is an old but important problem 3 transient changes is less clear The situation of interest in this 4 We introduce first the permanent change detection probmanuscript is of

2 THE NEW ADAPTIVE PAGE'S TEST the forms Motivation 1 In model 10 suppose both fo and fi are exactly known fo\(x  2w Then the Page test update g x is optimally the log likelihood fX\(x 1 212 ratio LLR If nothing whatever is known about fi noise N x2w plus transient then the situation is probably hopeless but if the situation is that the transient type is of a scale change as for which the corresponding LLR is when 11 might be used then the problem is to determine the correct bias and threshold Now the update rule g\(x is g\(X  pX 2/2 13 in general designed or tuned to a particular transient type more specifically to a specific transient strength within some In this simple situation constant fixed-length detectability can pdf family represented by the optimal built-in bias As opbe assured by specifying that posed to the fixed-length detection problem where a procedure usually provides better performance for a high energy SL 14 signal if it works well for a low energy one this fortunate NL situation does not carry through to quickest detection For instance the empirical variance provides a uniformly most where L is the length of the transient signal Here A is powerful UMP test for the fixed-length Gaussian scale-shift u which is conveniently parameterized by SL the aggregate problem but it will be seen that  11 can be easily dominated SNR for the L-length transient and the meaning is that SL when the parameter Or2 is guessed poorly This is key thus the bias b and the threshold h is chosen to yield desired Pd and T for the specific L-length transient signal We are inWe are interested in the detection of time-contiguous tranterested in probability of detection Pd for different transients sients with unknown location and strength the pdf fi in the run-length metric D of 4 is not sufficient and we rely 10 has the same form as fo yet with a parameter A that on the Markov-chain analyses of 11 to evaluate both Pd and is unknown and whose magnitude controls the transient T A synopsis of this approach is available in Appendix A of signal's detectability this paper Certainly this is a restrictive assumption but it is satisfied in It turns out that Page's test provides nowhere near constant many interesting problems for example consider the case of detectability as shown in figure 2 in which Pd  0.8 fo a unit-normal pdf and fi a Gaussian with mean   0 T  106 and the sample length N  103 It is noted that or similarly fi a Gaussian with variance ur2  1 Now since Page's test designed for a short-and-loud transient transient it is not unnatural in practice that some transients are shortlength L  1 2 and 4 provides good performance for such a and-loud while some are long-and-quiet we argue here that transient but shows very poor performance at detecting tranit is not a practically useful goal simply to be able to detect sients with L  50 Similarly a Page procedure designed for transients with a particular strength and length at least nd We long-and-quiet transients e.g L  200 and 400 proves very propose that poor at the detection of short-and-loud transients To explain this we plot the design biases u/2 and thresholds obtained A useful scheme should detect any transient signal whose via 11 versus transient length as the fixed curves on the fixed-length detectability exceeds a given value given the right of figure 3 in which Pd  0.8 and T  106 in the left average number of samples between false alarms be at figure we also show the aggregate SNR required to achieve least T the desired performance It can be seen that a long-and-quiet transient is better served by a small negative bias and a high In 1],[9 the proper scheme for biasing a Page detector is threshold but ill-served by the large bias and low threshold explored in the case that the magnitude of a distribution's designed for short-and-loud transient signals and vice versa change is unknown it turns out that biasing according to the least-detectable signal is not a bad idea The situation in this Thus we have a quandary the results of 18 show quite paper is different it is desired to detect all signals whose declearly that the variance-based Page procedure is a natural tectability is beyond a certain level and since both transient simple and robust choice for the detection of a wide variety length and strength are open a search for a least-detectable of transient signals Most other schemes for transient designal is moot tection tend to work well at detecting the sort of transient _ such as a damped sinusoid for which they are deConsidering its provenance designed for the disorder probsigned but to be of limited broad use However as a rule lem of 1 it will not be surprising that the probability these other approaches are only modestly affected by tranof detection for Page's test varies considerably for transient sient length/strength trade-offs while the Page processor can changes that one might reasonably consider to be equally apbe grossly inhibited by such a mismatch The Page detector parent We illustrate this by the toy problem of a Gaussian has the promise to be universal for transients but we must shift-in-mean from 20 In this case fo and fi in 10 have first solve the length/strength problem We do that now 3

optimization for larger transaction sizes and in cases where there are large number of candidate k itemsets 6 Conclusions In this paper e presented a parallel implementation of the Apriori algorithm on the SGI Power Challenge shared memory multi-processor We also discussed a set of optimizations which include optimized join and pruning computation balancing for candidate generation hash tree balancing and short-circuited subset checking We then presented experimental results on each of these Improvements of more than 40 were obtained for the computation and hash tree balancing The short-circuiting optimization was found to be extremely effective for databases with large transaction sizes Finally we reported the parallel performance of the algorithm While we d good speed-up we observed a need for parallel I/O techniques for further performance gains References  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Database mining A performance perspecti v e  I n IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engg  pages 5\(6 1993  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in lar ge databases In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1993  R Agra wal H Mannila R Srikant H T o i v onen and A I V erkamo F ast disco v ery of association rules In U F et al editor Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  MIT Press 1996  R Agra wal and J Shafer  P arallel mining of association rules design implementation and e xperience Technical Report RJ10004 IBM Almaden Research Center San Jose CA 95120 Jan 1996  R Agra wal and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Proc 20th VLDB Conf  Sept 1994  M Cierniak W  Li and M J Zaki Loop scheduling for heterogeneity  I n 4th IEEE Intl Symposium on High-Performance Distributed Computing also as URCS-TR 540 CS Dept Univ f Rochester  Aug 1995  M Holsheimer  M  K ersten H Mannila and H T o i v onen A perspecti v e on databases and data mining In 1st Intl Conf Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  Aug 1995  M Houtsma and A Swami Set-oriented mining of association rules In RJ 9567  IBM Almaden Oct 1993  H Mannila H T o i v onen and I V erkamo Ef 336cient algorithms for disco v ering association rules In AAAI Wkshp Knowledge Discovery in Databases  July 1994  J S P ark M Chen and P  S Y u  A n e f fecti v e hash based algorithm for mining association rules In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1995 17 Proceedings of the 1996 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing \(SC\22296 0-89791-854-1/96 $ 10.00 ACM
