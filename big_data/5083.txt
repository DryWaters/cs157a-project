supersets must be small. Obviously, the lemmas are fit for all vertical weighted itemsets. For example, let A be a large vertical weighted itemset, then supvCA be a subset of A, then have I.Cv, CCountCB 1=1 I. Cv,CCountCA i=l Wminsup, as a result, itemset B is a large vertical weighted itemset too. The similar proof that condition is that A is a small vertical weighted itemset, ACB, then B must be small But horizontal weighted itemsets do not agree with the two lemmas. The reason is that it is indefinitely to decide which value is more greater between sUPhCB A Thus, not all of subsets of horizontal weighted frequent itemset are frequent. And not all of supersets of horizontal weighted infrequent itemset are infrequent The mixed weighted support has been treated as a vertical weighted support with horizontal weighted factor From above discussions, we discover that the two lemmas do not work for mixed weighted itemsets. So that mixed weighted algorithms are different from Apriori algorithm V. THE DESCRIPTION OF MIXED WEIGHTED ASSOCIATION RULES ALGORITHM Inputs: A database 0 with the transactions T, where each item has vertical weight and horizontal weight, two threshold values Wminsup and Wminconf Outputs: A sets of mixed weighted rules \(include the weighted support and confidence Step 1: Scan the entire transaction database 0, find out the large l-itemsets C1 in that database Step2: Calculate the mixed weighted support of each item, reserve the item which weighted support is equal or greater than Wminsup, and then add all these items to frequent 1-itemsets L1 Step3: While k?2, candidate k-itemsets Ck are generated by Ck-1 conjoin itself, then calculate mixed weighted support of item sets in Ck Step4: Prune away the small itemsets \(was defined in [1 in Ck, drop itemset which mixed weighted support is lower than Wminsup, add the left to Lk, finally, combine with all the Lk 


StepS: If there is an existing itemset A in Lk and A  B u C , then calculate the value of confm \(B ? C reserve the rule such as B ? C which value is greater or equal than Wminconf Step6: Output all the mixed weighted rules such 1ikeB? c VI. THE MINING SAMPLES AND ANALYSIS ON CONSEQUENCE OF MIXED WEIGHTED ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON COLLEGE-WIDE EXMINATION COURSE GRADE Convenient for mining, the score of each question has been divided into three sections which contains excellent average, weak. Meanwhile, made a certain notation for each section, and then use the notation instead of the score in the corresponding section. Taking score of windows for example windows have IS points, the score has been divided into three sections: if it is not only greater or equal than 13, but also equal or lower than IS ,or scoreE[13,IS], which is defined excellent part, make 0 instead of the scores in this part; Similarly, score E [9,13 use E instead of the scores in that part; score E [0,9 defined weak part, and use F instead of the scores in the part The score of network, word, excel, optional have been divided into three sections, which apply the same approach where powerpoint and access questions as a questions of optional, and the greater points of power point and access as optional grades. The detail corresponding relations between sections of questions and notations are shown in table 1 TABLE!

In sequence, the notations of colleges of Mathematic Science, Electronic engineering, Physics and 


technology, Education science, Economics and management Law, Foreign studies, Physical culture, Music, File art are 0,1,2,3,4,S,6,7,8,9. The vertical weights of ten colleges Vi set as following: Vo:O.l; VJ:O.l; V2:O.l; V3:0.6; V4:O.S; Vs:O.S V6:0.6; V7:O.9; Vs:0.9; V9:O.9.

33%, confidence is 90%. However, the rules relevant to excel by using Apriori algorithm can not be found at the same thresholds And then, add score of single choice, the total score of student and the college as horizontal weighted items to transaction database, furthermore, 0.5, 1.2 and 1 have been assigned to the items in sequence. Other items' weights are the same as above setting. Score of single choice has been divided into three sections in the same way, and a certain notation has been assigned to each part. Also total score has been treated in the same way. In sequence, use notation A, B and C instead of scores in excellent, average and weak sections for single-choice questions, X, Y and Z for total score. With Wminsup=20% and Wminconf=30%, the following valuable rules have been discovered in the database 9 ? CCW sup = 27%, Wcan! = 38 9 ? L\(W sup = 27%, Wean! = 39 9 ? O\( W sup = 27%, Wean! = 69 9 ? Z\(W sup = 27%, Weanf = 83 Then set Wminsup=50% and Wminconf=80%, the rules have been extracted from the database o u Z ? T\(W sup = 53%, Wearif = 87 O u T  ? C\(W sup = 78%, Wean! = 100 Analyzing of the first four rules can discover that students from college of File art get the worst score in optional questions. Only if teachers strengthen the teaching of this chapter can improve average of the college, thereby improving average of the university. From later two rules we can find that grades of excel, optional and single choice have closer relationship with total score than other scores of questions. But if apply Apriori to mining rules in the transaction database and only if minimum support is decreased to 5%, rules relation with colleges can be obtained Moreover, the last rule with 48% support and 95 confidence can be obtained by using Apriori. Obviously using mixed weighted association rules algorithm improves the support and confidence of rules, and makes them be discovered easier VII. CONCLUSION This paper takes college computer cultural foundation course grade database as example, applies mixed weighted 


association rules algorithm to obtain some importance and valuable information according to characteristic of the database, such as the correlations of chapters, and the factors influence total score of students. The information has reference value for teaching, and is helpful to improve learning efficiency of students. Ultimately, the average scores of the students are improved. Similarly, the approach of analysis in scores of computer foundation course database can also be applied in other college examination course grade database, such like college English test grades database, principles of Marxist philosophy test scores database and so on. In addition, application in other database like national computer rank test, CET-4, a lot of valuable information can be discovered. This important information as reference for the teaching reform is beneficial to improve quality of teaching REFERENCES I] R. Agrawal and R.

We can then substitute in Equation \(5 obtain the extreme points of the lines in ?. Finally, we apply the homogeneous transformation to transform the coordinates of those points to the global coordinate system and trace the 3D lines. The result is shown in Fig. 8. Observe how the vertical lines are consistent with the 2D map Fig. 8. Environment with 3D lines VI. DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES This paper describes an original composite sensor approach that takes advantage of the information given by an omnidirectional camera and a laser range finder to ef 


ficiently solve the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem for indoor environments, and to reconstruct a 3D representation of the environment. The accompanying video illustrates the incremental generation of a 2D map and the estimation of the robot trajectory alongside the laser range data projected on omnidirectional images. It also shows the vertical lines detected in the images and their mapping into a 3D reconstruction of the environment In order to show the robustness of the methodology, we tested the algorithm with a sequence taken in a different indoor environment with our old robot Anis which is equipped with the same catadioptric camera and an AccuRange 4000 2D laser range finder. This laser is composed of a laser telemeter with a rotating mirror that allows measurements of points on 360?, except for an occlusion cone of approximately 30? caused by the assembly of the mirror. The resulting 2D map is shown in Figure 9. The vertical line extraction and the reconstruction of the 3D environment were 3523 Fig. 9. Global Map obtained by SLAM in Borel Building consistent as well The SLAM problem has been solved using many different approaches, however some important problems need to be addressed that are often directly linked to the sensors used Laser range finders cannot help in evaluating the translation of a robot moving in a straight line in a corridor. Mapping in dynamic environments is also hard with only laser data. On the other hand, using visual sensors alone introduces issues such as propagating correctly the scale factor, initializing the range when using a monocular sensor, and merging data when using multiples cameras In our approach, the laser provides metric information of the environment that helps to fix a scale factor \(removing the difficulty of propagating the scale factor need to use multiple cameras. Throughout the paper we have identified several advantages of combining laser and visual sensors. Our experimental results are encouraging and give us valuable insight into the possibilities offered by this composite sensor approach We have considered several research directions that could be pursued to improve the results obtained so far. We have thought about extending our algorithm with loop closure de 


tection. This would allow the algorithm to detect previously visited locations and improve the accuracy of mapping and the precision in the estimation of the robot pose. Being able to detect previously visited places is of great importance to solve the problem of global localization and to recover the robot from kidnapping, a situation occurring when the robot is displaced by something out of its control \(e.g. taking an elevator, being transported from one location to another Therefore, solving the loop closure problem will not only improve SLAM performance, but will as well enable new capabilities Further work will concentrate on an extension of the PSM algorithm to exploit the information about vertical lines detected using omnidirectional images. Segmentation of the ground \(floor a dense \(textured onto the geometric model of the world. Finally, we believe the general approach can be extended to solve the full six degrees of freedom \(6DOF active field of research REFERENCES 1] L.Charbonnier and O.Strauss, A suitable polygonal approximation for laser range finder data, Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles 95 Symposium, Detroit, Mi, 1995, pp 118-123 2] J.Nieto, T.Bailey and E.Nebot, Recursive scan-matching SLAM Robotics and Autonomous Systems, vol. 55, 2007, pp 39-49 3] J.S.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
