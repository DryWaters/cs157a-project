Hierarchical Feature Learning from Sensorial Data by Spherical Clustering\nBonny Banerjee and Jayanta K Dutta\nInstitute for Intelligent Systems, and Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering\nThe University of Memphis\nMemphis, TN 38152, USA\nbonnybanerjee@yahoo.com, jkdutta@memphis.edu\nAbstract—Surveillance sensors are a major source of un-\nstructured Big Data. Discovering and recognizing spatiotem-\nporal objects \(e.g., events in such data is of paramount\nimportance to the security and safety of facilities and indi-\nviduals. What kind of computational model is necessary for\ndiscovering spatiotemporal objects at the level of abstraction\nthey occur? Hierarchical invariant feature learning is the crux\nto the problems of discovery and recognition in Big Data.\nWe present a multilayered convergent neural architecture for\nstoring repeating spatially and temporally coincident patterns\nin data at multiple levels of abstraction. A node is the canonical\ncomputational unit consisting of neurons. Neurons are con-\nnected in and across nodes via bottom-up, top-down and lateral\nconnections. The bottom-up weights are learned to encode a\nhierarchy of overcomplete and sparse feature dictionaries from\nspace- and time-varying sensorial data by recursive layer-by-\nlayer spherical clustering. The model scales to full-sized high-\ndimensional input data and also to an arbitrary number of\nlayers thereby having the capability to capture features at\nany level of abstraction. The model is fully-learnable with\nonly two manually tunable parameters. The model is general-\npurpose \(i.e., there is no modality-speci?c assumption for any\nspatiotemporal data algorithm, without any alteration, to learn meaningful\nfeature hierarchies from images and videos which can then\nbe used for recognition. Besides being online, operations in\neach layer of the model can be implemented in parallelized\nhardware, making it very ef?cient for real world Big Data\napplications.\nKeywords-learning hierarchical representations; repeating\ncoincidences; spherical clustering; Hebbian rule\nI INTRODUCTION\nSurveillance sensors \(e.g., video surveillance cameras e.g., airport or an individual \(e.g., as\nin assisted living residences and nursing homes for dementia\npatients round-the-clock generate a formidable amount of\nunstructured data. Discovering and recognizing spatiotempo-\nral objects \(e.g., visual objects, actions, events the security and safety of the\nfacility or individual. Determining appropriate features is the\ncrux to the problems of discovery and recognition. In recent\nyears, there has been a surge of interest in learning feature\nhierarchies from data using multilayered or deep learning\nmodels largely motivated by the layered organization of the\nneocortex. From an application standpoint, a good feature\nlearning algorithm, if developed, would save a signi?cant\namount of human effort usually invested in manually study-\ning the data and coming up with appropriate features for ac-\ncurate classi?cation in each domain or application Manually\nencoding features for detection, recognition or prediction is\nnot always feasible given the 5Vs Volume, Velocity, Variety,\nValue, Veracity brain-inspired multi-\nlayered neural model where each layer selectively clusters its\ninput which is the output of the lower layer. Recursive layer-\nby-layer clustering is not a new idea \(see [1] for example model stands out due to its computational\nproperties that help cope with the 5Vs of Big Data. The\nproperties may be summarized as follows.\n1. Unsupervised and online operation to cope with volume,\nvelocity and value; no personal information is compromised\nas the data is never stored;\n2. Invariant feature learning from spatiotemporal data to\ncope with veracity by discovering objects, actions and events\nfrom repeating coincident patterns;\n3. Scaling to full-sized high-dimensional input data to cope\nwith volume and variety;\n4. Scaling to an arbitrary number of layers thereby having\nthe capability to capture features at any level of abstraction\nto discover objects, actions and events;\n5. Hierarchical feature learning from data in multiple modal-\nities with the learning rule derived from the same objective\nfunction to cope with variety; no modality-speci?c assump-\ntion is made for data from different kinds of sensors;\n6. Fully-learnable with only two manually tunable parame-\nters, the learning rate and threshold decay parameter, to cope\nwith volume and variety.\nWe present results by deploying the model for learning\nhierarchies of rich meaningful features from sensorial data in\nmultiple modalities – images and videos. Results from this\nbrain-inspired model that support ?ndings in neuroscience\nare highlighted.\nA. Objective function\nFormulating an objective function helps to understand a\nmodel’s global behavior. Two approaches to feature learn-\ning using deep models are prevalent. In one approach, an\nobjective or energy function is minimized by iteratively\nupdating connection weights with respect to an error signal\n7\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE nthat is propagated backwards. In case of supervised learning,\nthis signal is often the gradient of the classi?cation error\nwhich results in learning discriminative features while in\nthe unsupervised case, it is the gradient of the reconstruction\nerror which results in learning generative features. An appro-\npriate regularization term is often used to avoid over?tting\nand induce sparsity. Variants of deep belief networks 


2],\nconvolutional neural networks [3], [4], and sparse/denoising\nautoencoders [5] are trained using this approach \(also see\n[6], [7 the distribution of recurring co-\nincident patterns in the data. Clustering is an example of this\napproach though not the only one. Variants of Neocognitron\n[8], HMAX [9] and Hierarchical Temporal Memory [10 are\ntrained using this approach. While a systematic comparison\nbetween the two approaches is missing in the literature, it\nhas been shown that the deep belief network is outperformed\nby very simple mixture models at capturing the statistics of\nnatural images; adding layers does not effect its performance\nif the ?rst layer is trained well enough [11]. Our model\nlearns feature hierarchies from recurring coincidences in the\ndata in an unsupervised and online manner, minimizing the\nfollowing objective function on convergence:\n\(X ,W 1\n2\nn?\ni=1\n?\nj?N \(i 1 d-dimensional data points and features respec-\ntively, N \(i wi, |\n?n\ni=1N \(i have\nunit norm. Each layer in our model learns a set of non-\northogonal features that soft-partitions a subset of the nor-\nmalized input space; this subset, given by\n?n\ni=1N \(i formulation may be construed\nas soft-clustering on the surface of a hypersphere of unit\nradius \(a.k.a spherical clustering [12 matching pursuit \(OMP  a generative model, is a generalization of coef?cient\ncomputation in spherical clustering as, for an input the latter\nrequires only one feedforward pass of OMP to determine\nthe coef?cient. Thus, spherical clustering is computationally\nmore ef?cient than generative models employing OMP-like\niterative algorithms.\nB. Online learning\nBy online learning, we refer to two capabilities in a model\n– it should be able to learn from instances where each\ninstance is seen only once in a lifetime, and it should be\nable to learn and infer simultaneously. In order to learn\nand infer simultaneously, we use activations and states of\nneurons learning depends on the state of a neuron while\ninference is based on activation strength; the state changes\nfor a winner neuron if its activation crosses an adaptive\nthreshold unique for each neuron \(section II-C section II-D for suf?ciently small learning\nrate. Empirically, our model learns features from different\nkinds of data that remain stable over prolonged periods of\nonline learning.\nC. Scaling to full-size high-dimensional data\nAlgorithms have been proposed that learn useful features\nfrom small patches of data \(e.g., 10×10 pixel image patch  e.g., 1024×1024 pixel image computationally tractable\nway is a non-trivial problem [4]. An ensemble of neurons,\ncalled a node, is the canonical computational unit in our\narchitecture. Each node learns from a small patch of data\nwhile each neuron in a node learns to respond to a unique\nfeature. After seeing a large number of patches, all nodes in\na layer will have learned the same set of features. Hence,\ninstead of learning at each node independently, we share\nthe learning in a node throughout a layer. This has three\nbene?ts. First, learning occurs much faster in all nodes as\neach gets the opportunity to learn from all the patches in\neach data. Second, the invariant properties \(e.g., translation\ninvariance behave uniformly thereby making the\nmodel’s behavior tractable. See section II and Fig. 1.\nD. Scaling to arbitrary number of layers\nWhen designing multilayered architectures, a pertinent\nquestion to ask is: how many layers are necessary or suf?-\ncient for hierarchical feature learning? No clear answer could\nbe found in the literature. We present an architecture where\nthe process of feature learning at any layer from its lower\nlayer activations may be continued in an arbitrary number\nof layers thereby learning arbitrarily large and complex\nfeatures. However, features will be learned in a layer only if\na subset of neurons in the lower layer are repeatedly active\ntogether. If such a subset does not exist, features in a higher\nlayer will neither be stable nor meaningful. Thus, the number\nof layers necessary and suf?cient for hierarchical feature\nlearning is driven by the data [1]. Indeed, we will show\nin section III-A that three layers of features can be learned\nfrom one set of data but only two layers can be learned from\nanother. Being able to scale a model to arbitrary number of\nlayers is crucial for discovering the largest possible features\nwhich are closer to symbolic/linguistic representations.\nE. Common learning algorithm for different modalities\nThe common cortical algorithm hypothesis states that\nthe objectives of learning algorithms operating in the dif-\nferent perceptual cortices are very similar [15]–[18]. We\n8\npresent a minimal model that can be fully learned with\nonly two manually tunable parameters and is noncommittal\nto any modality-speci?c processing of the data. The fea-\ntures learned by this model from images and videos are\nin accordance to well-established ?ndings in neuroscience.\nWe claim that this model is a promising candidate for\nverifying the common cortical algorithm hypothesis, and 


that\nthe hypothesis indeed seems plausible and is worth more\ninvestigation.\nIn the next section, we describe the model followed by\nexperimental results and conclusions.\nII. NETWORK MODEL\nA. Architecture\nOur network architecture consists of a hierarchy of layers\nof nodes \(see Fig. 1 consisting of an ensemble of densely connected neurons.\nIn the general case, neurons in a node are sparsely connected\nto the neurons in the neighboring nodes in the same layer,\none layer above and one layer below by lateral, bottom-\nup \(or feedforward or lowest hierarchy receives input\nfrom external spatiotemporal data \(e.g., images, videos convergent, i.e. multiple neurons in a layer\nreport to one neuron in the immediate higher layer. The\nreceptive eld \(RF In\nour hierarchical model, the RF for a neuron is determined\nby the neurons in the immediate lower layer reporting to\nit. The RF size is the same for all neurons in a layer and\nincreases as we ascend up the hierarchy. In this paper, we\nwill concentrate on learning feature hierarchies using the\nfeedforward connections only. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Architecture used in our model is shown. The circles in each\nlayer denote nodes each of which contains an ensemble of neurons See\nsection II for details.\nB. Operation\nAt each sampling instant, our model accepts spatial data\nas input through the ?rst layer which is passed on to higher\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1  0  0 \n0  1  0 n0  0  1 \n1  0  0 \n0  1  0 \n0  0  1 \n\(i ii iii iv v vi based on the simple cell\nwiring model of Hubel & Wiesel [20]. In \(i overlapping on-center-off-surround ganglion cells are shown that\nconnect to a simple cell in the higher layer primary visual cortex or V1 the other six are not, the corresponding ideal weight matrix for the\nconnections and the receptive ?eld of simple cell would be as shown in \(ii iii our\narchitecture. Thus, an example of a receptive ?eld obtained by wiring the\nsimple cells arranged in a 3 × 3 grid is shown in \(vi or V2 data into groups [19].\nOver time, each neuron in a node gets tuned to a unique\nfeature which represents a cluster center. Functionally, a\nnode is a bag of ?lters all of which are applied to each\npatch of the input data.\nThe output \(or state, see section II-C operation is executed\nin each node in any layer. Thus, the feedforward weights in\nthis hierarchical model are learned by recursive layer-by-\nlayer spherical clustering. Fig. 2 depicts the operation of\nthis model.\nNotation. N \(l i is referred to\nas the neighborhood in layer l of the ith neuron. W \(k,l t connection from the jth neuron\nin layer k to the ith neuron in layer l at time t. A\(l t l t n\(l t input \(or\nlowest l t l?1 i l?1,l t l?1 t 2 l l?1 l?1,l information is implicit. Since each feature in\n9\nW \(l?1,l l?1 l normalized\ndot product of the input with each feature. This allows a\nneuron to act as a suspicious coincidence detector [21],\nresponding with high activation if the input pattern matches\nthe feature encoded in its receptive ?eld.\nFor a given input, all neurons in a node receive activations.\nThe maximally activated neuron in a node is the “winner”.\nWhile we compute the winner using a max operation, it is\nmore biologically plausible to consider lateral connections\nwithin a node using which neurons inhibit each other at\na faster time scale eventually settling at some stable state.\nLateral inhibition has been used for similar purposes in\nmany models, such as, in [14], in the form of V -cells in\nNeocognitron [8] and in the LISSOM model 22].\nThe state of a neuron is binary and is given by\nS\n\(l t l t l t i, and\nA\n\(l t l t 3 Only\nthe winner in a node is assigned the state 1 if its threshold\nis crossed. This is how our model implements the winner-\ntake-all mechanism which allows only the neuron of highest\nactivity to learn. We say a neuron has ?red if its state reaches\nunity.\nThus, a neuron integrates all inputs over its RF until\nit reaches its threshold when it ?res if it is the winner.\nAs soon as it ?res or if it fails to ?re, it discharges and\nthen starts integrating again. The discharge from a neuron\ninhibits neighboring neurons in its own layer As in [14], it\nmay be assumed that this lateral inhibition is proportional\nto a neuron’s total accumulated charge \(or activation in a layer do not get tuned to the same\nfeature. The inhibition in?uences a neuron’s activation which\nin turn 


in?uences its inhibition. This cycle ensues until a\nstable state is reached. In most practical cases, this inhibition\nis observed to be strong enough to drive all neurons close to\ntheir baseline activation. In our implementation, we assume\nthis baseline to be zero which does not affect our features\nqualitatively.\nD Learning: Updating weights and thresholds\nFeedforward weights to neuron j in layer l with S\(l t updated following Hebbian rule.\nW\n\(l?1,l t+1 1 l?1,l t l?1 t 4 learning rate that decreases with time for\n?ner convergence, 0 < ? < 1, S\(0 0 is obtained by applying gradient descent on the\nobjective function in equ. 1 in an online setting Feedforward\nweights leading to each neuron are initialized to ones and\nnormalized to have unit norm, which allows all neurons in\na layer to compete on an equal footing. A new neuron is\nnot recruited unless the incoming pattern is more similar to\nthe initialized feature than to any of the learned features.\nAfter each update, weights to each neuron are normalized\nto have unit norm. Thus, feedforward connection from a\npresynaptic neuron \(i j to j are weakened.\nThe weakening of connections is crucial for robustness as\nit helps remove infrequent coincident patterns from memory\nwhich are probably noise.\nThe threshold is updated as follows:\n?\n\(l t+ 1 l t l t 1 l t 5 0 <\n? < 1. Due to the threshold, only a subset of stimuli can\ntrigger learning. If ? = 1, all stimuli are used in learning\nas in traditional clustering algorithms. If ? = 0, no stimulus\ncan cross the threshold, hence learning does not occur. Size\nof the set of effective stimuli reduces with reduction in the\nvalue of ?. The threshold decay mechanism ensures that\nthe size of the effective subset remains ?xed throughout\nthe learning process, thereby maintaining the plasticity of\nthe network. The winner-take-all mechanism along with the\nthreshold favor neurons with sparsely distributed activity.\nIn the proposed model, a neuron always passes on its ac-\ntivations to its neighboring neurons in all layers irrespective\nof whether it ?res or not. This is crucial for online operation\nwhere learning and inferencing proceed simultaneously and\nnot in distinct phases If a pattern has been learned and\na part of it is shown, a partial pattern of activations will\nstimulate the remaining neurons of the pattern to become\nactive thereby completing the whole pattern. However, the\nstrength of connections will not be altered unless enough of\nthe pattern has been seen \(as determined by of\nthe presynaptic neurons are the best match to the incoming\npattern in their respective nodes to ?re the postsynaptic\nneuron in the higher layer.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe proposed model was deployed for learning feature\nhierarchies from data in different modalities in an unsuper-\nvised and online manner with the learning rule derived from\nthe same objective function as in equ. 1. The feedforward\nweights were learned layer by layer with ?\(t t ?\n1 1 + t/106 0 patches for adjacent nodes was 75% and\n25% in the ?rst and second layers respectively. The top layer\nhad only one node. The number of nodes in each layer is a\nfunction of the % overlaps and the RF sizes of neurons.\nFeatures for the second and third layers were recon-\nstructed as follows. For a neuron in the second layer, a\n10\nneuron in each ?rst layer node that most strongly connected\nto it was chosen. The features represented by these neurons\nwere weighed by the connection strengths and spatially\norganized taking into consideration the % overlaps among\nnodes. Once the second layer features were constructed, the\nsame procedure was carried out for each third layer neuron\nto construct their features. To reconstruct unknown data, a\nwinner neuron was computed in each node in the highest\nlayer. A neuron in each node in the lower layers was chosen\nbased on strongest connection to the winner. The chosen\nlowest layer features, each multiplied by the norm of the\ncorresponding input data patch and spatially organized based\non the % overlaps among nodes reconstructed the input.\nA. Images\nOur model learned three layers of features from natural\nimages \(downloaded from Google images to crudely highlight edges \(performed\nby center-surround cells before the signal reaches V1 learned in the ?rst layer were edges/bars in\ndifferent orientations and phases, similar to RFs of simple\ncells in V1 [20]. The features learned in the second layer\nwere different combinations of these edges, similar to RFs\nfound in V2 [23], [24] \(see Fig. 3 any coherent\npattern. Our model also learned three layers of features\nfrom 60,000 images of ten handwritten numerals {0, 1, ...9}\nfrom the MNIST dataset [3]. As shown in Fig. 4, parts\nof numerals were learned in ?rst layer, larger parts in the\nsecond layer, and whole numerals in the third layer. The\ngrayscale intensity denotes the strength of a feature. ? was\nchosen as 10?4 for natural images and 10?1 for MNIST as\nthere are many more outliers in the former data set compared\nto the latter. Thus, the same model could learn three layers\nof features from the MNIST data but only two layers from\nnatural images due to the absence of recurring coincidences\namong second layer features in the latter case.\nFigure 3. Features of size 10×10 and 20×20 were

Videos\nSpatiotemporal video features were learned in our model\nfrom 3D voxels where time is the third dimension. Such\nFigure 4. A hierarchy of features were learned from handwritten numerals\nin MNIST dataset in ?rst, second and third layers with receptive ?eld sizes\n10× 10, 16 16 and 28× 28 respectively. 400, 150 and 50 features from\n?rst \(top left top right bottom e.g walking, waving 5, and direction from left\nto right.\nfeatures have often been learned from voxels for computer\nvision and machine learning applications, particularly for\naction recognition \(see for example, [25], [26 our\nmodel was exposed to videos of ten actions \(e.g., walking,\nwaving Weizmann\ndataset [27] with ? = 10?2, the ?rst layer neurons with\nRF size 10× 10× 5 learned edges in different orientations\nand moving in different directions. That is, they developed\norientation- and direction-selective RFs as in complex cells\nin V1 [20] \(see Fig. 5 particular orientation in different locations\nwithin their RFs, and therefore, have learned position-\ninvariant features.\nC. Clustering\nAs stated in section I-A, our learning algorithm may be\nconstrued as a special case of clustering. We compared\nits clustering performance to that of three algorithms with\ninteresting properties. First, the k-means is one of the most\nwidely used clustering algorithms and its performance will\nserve as a benchmark. Second is the algorithm proposed\nby Einha¨user et al. [14] for learning features from natural\nvideos. It has two distinct properties: division by past trace\n11\n?12 ?10 ?8 ?6 ?4 ?2 0\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nThreshold decay parameter, ? \(in log scale nIris\nWine\nGlass\nVehicle\nSegment\nMean\nFigure 6. The in?uence of ? on the performance of our model on ?ve\nUCI datasets is shown. The errorbars indicate standard deviations.\nfor achieving translation or viewpoint invariance, proposed\nby Fo¨ldia´k [21], and lateral inhibition for determining the\nwinner. Third is the topology adaptive self-organizing neural\nnetwork or TASONN [28] for skeletonization of data sets.\nIt belongs to the class of algorithms known as growing\nneural gas [29] which start with a very few neurons and\nstrategically add neurons and connections with learning until\na stopping criterion is met. Hence, the ?nal result is immune\nto bad initializations.\nFive datasets from the UCI machine learning repository\n[30] were used in our experiments \(see Table I mean ? ± std. dev and two supervised algorithms over 1000 trials\non each of the datasets. The advantage of TASONN and our\nmodel over k-means for initialization is revealed by the ?.\nOn average over all datasets, the classi?cation accuracies\nof Einha¨user et al.’s model and TASONN were 45%, k-\nmeans and our model were 64%, and the two supervised\nalgorithms were 74%. For measuring similarity, k-means and\nTASONN use Euclidean distance while Einha¨user et al.’s and\nour models use dot product. Among the four unsupervised\nalgorithms, our model performed with highest accuracy and\nlowest ?. Fig. 6 shows the variation in performance of our\nmodel for different values of ? for each dataset. The best\nperformance is achieved at ? = 10?2; however, for natural\ndata with many more outliers, ? = 10?4 performs better.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nManually studying and encoding features for discovery,\nrecognition or prediction is not always feasible given the 5Vs\nof sensorial data. In the past decade, a number of relatively\ncomplex models that require long training time to tune a\nlarge number of hyperparameters have been proposed for\nlearning feature hierarchies. We have shown that a fully-\nlearnable model, with only two manually tunable param-\neters, can learn rich meaningful feature hierarchies from\nrepeating coincidences in spatiotemporal data in different\nmodalities in an online and unsupervised manner. We used\nthe McCulloch-Pitts neuron model with a variable threshold\nthat is unique for each neuron and adaptive to the data. A\nconstant parameter was used to decay this threshold such\nthat the in?uence of outliers on learning may be controlled.\nThis is crucial for using the same model for learning\nfrom data with different proportion of outliers, such as,\nnatural images with a lot of outliers and clean handwritten\nnumerals, as in MNIST data set, with very few outliers.\nLearning was facilitated by the Hebbian rule and winner-\ntake-all mechanism. Generative models employing iterative\ncoef?cient computation offer more explanatory power but\nare computationally less ef?cient than the winner-take-all\nmechanism; ef?ciency is of primary importance when deal-\ning with Big Data at the lower levels of abstraction.\nOur network architecture consisted of a hierarchy of layers\nof nodes, a node being a canonical computational unit\nconsisting of an ensemble of neurons. We showed how our\nalgorithm, without any alteration, could learn the feedfor-\nward weights in this architecture which embody the features,\nfrom images and videos. Neurons, when exposed to spa-\ntiotemporal data \(videos got tuned to position-invariant and\ndirection-selective features. The model scales to realistic-\nsized high-dimensional data and arbitrary number of layers.\nOperations in each layer of the model can be 


implemented\nin parallelized hardware, making it very ef?cient for real\nworld Big Data applications. We conclude that the proposed\nmodel is a promising candidate for verifying the common\ncortical algorithm hypothesis as well as for discovering\nspatiotemporal objects in real world Big Data.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nResearch reported in this paper was partially supported\nby NSF CISE Grant No. 1231620.

compression method\nthat clips out image parts not of primary interest. Traditional\ndata compression variations could be explored in a responder\ncontext. For example, some man-made disasters such as\nchemical spills are hazardous to responders but may not\nbe detectable from simple imagery. Hyperspectral sensors\ncould potentially warn responders, but have data volumes\ntoo high for transmission to a phone. Years of research has\nbeen devoted to hyperspectral data compression [68] but data\nvolumes are still too high for mobile computing.\nIn summary, earth quantization provides a novel way to\npartition the earth and opens a new horizon for rapid wide\nscale dissemination of large amounts of remote sensing data\nat near real-time rates. The Fast-Earth geospatially-organized\ncache and server based on the earth quantization concept has\npotential to transform future remote sensing dissemination\nand image processing capabilities.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

I will show recent examples of the use of nonlinear control theory for the assimilation and con-\ntrol of single neuron and network dynamics, a control framework for Parkinson’s disease, and the potential \nfor unification in control of spreading depression and seizures. Lastly, I will discuss why the subtle and \ndeep intersection of symmetry, in brains and models, is important to take into account in this transdisci-\nplinary fusion of computational models of the computational brain with real time control.  \n Biographical Sketch: Steven J.

That has necessitated the challenge of con-\ntrolling the limb with such superior dexterity.  I will introduce methods for dexterous nprosthesis control, from myoelectric to cortical \(EEG, Electrocorticogram, neural \nspike, local field potential incorporating multimodal sensors, such as camera and video tracking, may lead to more functional \nand practical prosthesis control.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
