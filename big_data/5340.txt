Comparison of Group Recommendation Techniques in Social Networks Behrouz Minaei-Bidgoli Computer Engineering Department Iran University of Science and Technology Tehran, Iran b_Minaei@iust.ac.ir Leila Esmaeili 1 and Mahdi Nasiri 2 1,2 Computer Engineering Department 1 University of Qom, Qom, Iran 2 Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran Esmaeili.Lhe@gmail.com, Nasiri_m@iust.ac.ir Abstract  Virtual communities and groups are known as one of the features of social networks for creating the possibility for users to join together and interact. Regarding the growth of social networks as well as attracting new users of various ages and creation of different groups, assisting users seems quite necessary. Along with studying some of the common recommender methods in social networks in this paper, a new method is explained. This new method is designed using d-tree classification, association rules and the concepts of information theory which compared with others, it gives better results. It is also possible in this system to offer recommendations to new users who have just joined the network and do not have any links Keywords-social network; recommender system; content based filtering; collaborative filtering; hybrid I  I NTRODUCTION Recommender systems \(RS\ have been in use since 1970  t h e y are co ns idered as an essential web application. By means of personalization in web and by using RSs, it is possible to recommend users items, web pages and persons based on their characteristics and needs Among the recommendations made by the RS, the user is always free to choose. Information required in such systems is usually acquired from web usage analysis, web content and web structure. The recommender systems are put into three distinct categories: content-based filtering \(CB systems, collaborative filtering \(CF\systems and hybrid system    ong th ese s y ste m s, t h e last t w o ar e more applicable than the content-based filtering systems A social network \(SN\ocial struct made of nodes that could be interlinked Since 1997 social networks are officially known as a social struct made of interlinked nodes. In other words, SNs ar e areas in cyber space where each user profile represents a user; this virtual world creates an opportunity for them to be linked with other people with whom they have common interests [1  A m o ng ma n y o t he r type of relations, in this virtual world users may have friendship, financial and political relationships. One of the very important features of social networks is the existence of groups where users could share their opinions and give comments These groups could be created around many fundamental ideas. Virtual groups of various types are increasing and many new ones are always being created Due to this variety, always there is a chance of joining the wrong groups; therefore, users need to be assisted in finding the right groups by receiving recommendations from the SN In this paper, based on some of the common recommender systems, we offer group recommendations to users of social networks. Furthermore, we introduce a new hybrid method which is based on the similarity among users in a given group. This study is applied to a Persian speaking social network with more than 3300 groups in 19 categories Since on average users have memberships in two groups, in our methods, our recommendation lists include a pair of groups for each user; of course more items could also be recommended In the following section, we review related works. In section three we discuss some common recommending techniques as well as our new hybrid recommender technique. In section four results are explained. Finally section five concludes the paper II  R ELATED WORKS A Recommendation Methods Regardless of how recommender systems give personalized and non-pers onalized recommendations different methods of recommender systems could be put into three categories 1 Content based Filtering CB recommender systems, analyze item specifications to find items that suit user preferences. In this method, user profiles include features and items chosen by the user in the Consequently, item descriptions and those of the user in his profile are the basis of offering recommendations in this system. CB systems have two main weaknesses: they only recommend items similar to those chosen in the past and the system must extract meaningful and useful features from the content 2 Collaborative Filtering CF systems give recommendations based on the retrieved information from users who have shared similar interests and preferences in the past In th i s m e t h od sy s t e m us es th e f e edback s received from other similar users to give recommendations. The main advantage of this method is that, in this method, the community of users may give their opinions about certain items, and also provide feedbacks and ratings; as a result, ther e is a chance for quite new items to be recommended to the us T h e m a i n  2011 1st International eConference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering \(ICCKE 978-1-4673-5713-5/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 236 


purpose of this method is to offer recommendations that considering profiles similarity, fall in the same category Video Data and Personalized T elevision System are also the two systems that give new recommendations to users based on their previous pref erences \(actors, screenplay movie, etc s idering t h e n atu re of  th i s  m e t h od, th e  system will provide weak and non-transparent predictions in case the number of users should be too few, \(Cold Star  9 Oth e r draw bac k s of th is m e th od in cl u d e First  Rater, Sparsity and Popularity B  3 Hybrid Method To overcome the before-mentioned weaknesses of CF and CB methods as well as improve the accuracy and the effect of recommendations on users researchers have tried to make hybrid systems by mixing different meth T h is co m b in at ion co uld be a result of various methods of CF or that of CF and CB or ultimately a mixture of other methods B Recommendation Evaluation Metrics Two principal metrics applied in evaluation of RSs are coverage Equation 1 precision Equation 2\erage is about how well the system covers user demands precision is the ratio of useful recommendations to all recommended items    Items  Favorite   Items  Favorite   Items  d Recommende  Coverage 1   Items  d Recommende   Items  Favorite   Items  d Recommende  Precision 2 III  M ETHODOLOGY In this section we illustrate two main phases preprocessing the data set an d modeling and creation the various recommender systems. Particularly, the new method of this paper will also be studied in details A Data Preprocessing Data preprocessing is one of the most important and time consuming processes in data mining and has a greater importance in web-based systems The data set used in this research is from a non-English speaking SN which covers a 5-year and half activity duration. It has more than 3300 groups in 19 different categories including: youth, health religion, politics and sports. Du e to many changes applied to the site, the data in the database lacked sufficient integrity and much of user information, saved in text format, needed to be classified. Consequently, to study and analyze the information, under complicated and time-consuming processes, the un-structed data were converted into structed and appropriate ones. To classify some of the features experts and reference websites were consulted; in some cases, we managed to convert un-structed data to structed ones by interviewing people and doing surveys. In this paper the main data set was created manually. Unfortunately it will not be possible to include all documentations and illustrate all the phases; nevertheless, here we have briefly pointed out some of the details Out of 3300 groups in our data set, 87.97% of groups have less than 10 members and despite the long time since their creation, there has not been any activity in many of these groups and they are technically inactive. Therefore, we selected the 15 more active and favored groups as our targets Table I For each user as a node in our social network, we created a profile with 52 features; some of these features include: sexuality, language, height, weight, age, date of birth, city, marital status, job, favorite books, music, movies and sports, number of friends date of membership, number of joined groups and number of sent posts in the group. We designated each feature a new undefined category Furthermore, since assigning any values to features with missing values would affect the reliability of the research and consequently the final decision making, to maintain accuracy and reliability of data, users with missing values were tagged undefined In some rare cases we managed to assign correct values to them by comparing them with those of other features. In some cases features such as age, height and weight outlier values were identified and were assigned values based on the values of other features of that user or those of other similar members. In the end, 54.49% of each user profile was filled. We standardized all values between 0 and 1 by Min-Max normalization method 1 Detecting Noise Group Members Experts believe than some users join groups out of curiosity or ignorance. Such users neither are active in groups nor do they follow group activities; such users therefore, could be considered as noise users. To identify the main users, we use hierarchical cluster analysis \(HAC\ and to determine the similarities between users we apply Eucliclian Distance   HAC is a general view for cluster analysis. Primary goal of cluster analysis is to classify objects; therefore, all similar objects must fall in the same cluster. The resulting clusters of objects should show high internal homogeneity and high external heterogeneity [1  A n i m po rtan t ste p  in HA C method is the repetitive calculation of the distances between objects and clusters to which those objects belong. The output is presented as a dendrogram. The frequently used algorithms for hierarchical clustering are: average linkage complete linkage, single linkage and Ward method. The main difference of these methods is in the way the distance between clusters is calculated [11 1 2  We u s e d  W a r d  algorithm in this research, Sum of the Squared Error \(SSE internal measurement was used to evaluate the effectiveness of clustering \(Equation 3\ [13  T h e  SSE  f o r a clu ste r is th e  sum of distances between its internal members and its centroid   K 1 iC x n 1 j 2 j i j i  x m SSE  3  237 


Figure 1  The vertical axis shows the distance from the cluster centroid and the existing members in a cluster are drawn on the horizontal axis Users in area C, depending on their values, might be considered as Noise or a main user. Users in area D are known as Noise and deleted. Finally, users who are placed in other areas are those who have an acceptable similarity with the cluster centroid and which cannot be marked as Noise. As a result the remaining members of the group will be more homogeneous We used Gaussian distribution in each group cluster to identify the noises. Members of one of the G03 clusters are shown in Figure 2. In each cluster, users are illustrated based on their distance from the cluster centroid. Eventually 181 users were identified as noise users B Common recommendation techniques In this section, based on the main data set of the paper four common recommendation techniques are introduced 1 Groups with more users \(Rec1 in this technique, the two groups with the most number of users are recommended. This method is non-personalized and recommends the same groups to all users TABLE I  15 MOST ACTIVE GROUPS  INFORMATION Number of Single Memberships Primary Group Size Category Group ID 225 373 Social 01 98 158 Social 02 88 219 Social 03 123 133 Social 04 85 131 Social 05 188 211 Social 06 70 212 Morality and Spirituality 07 109 151 Morality and Spirituality 08 87 134 Entertainment 09 54 151 Entertainment 10 120 137 Revolution 11 87 154 Religion 12 90 276 Literature 13 80 207 Youth 14 112 140 Sport 15 2 Collaborative filtering \(Rec2 in this personalized method, users with similar memberships are put into similar categories; and in each category, the two groups that have the most number of users will be recommended to the users in that category. Hierarchical clus tering is used to put users into different categories. The limitation of this method is that there is no recommendation for those who have just joined the SN or still have no group memberships 3 Recommendation based on users' friends \(Rec3 this personalized method is based on the concept of graphs. In this technique, the two groups which have the most popularity between a user's frie nds are recommended to that user. The limitation for this method is that no recommendation will be provided for users who have just joined the SN or those who do not have any connections with other members 4 Recommendation based on association rules \(Rec4 in this method, the relationship between groups and user membership in groups are focused. For each group, by using association rules and considering user memberships, the two more closely related groups are found. The relationship between A and B means that, for example, most users who are members of group B are also members of group A therefore, group B and group A are related. As a result when a user is a member of group B, we recommend group A. the limitation for this method is that users who are not members of any groups or who have recently joined the SN will not receive any recommendations C Hybrid techniques 1 The new hybrid technique Rec5  Users in a SN could join and be active in more than one group. In addition a group contains members who have joined the group due to their common goal or interest. What is recommended in this system is, therefore, different from recommendations made by other RSs. Regardless of its members, a group is the same as the features of its members; and we could identify a group by its members' features. We believe that users with the same features and interests join the same groups. To provide a unified model and iden tify the main users of each group, determining user activity degree in group and measuring user similarity with other members of that group are required. Once the main group of each user is identified we used D-tree to predict user membership in a group Finally, regarding association rules, we recommended group lists of two that were related to user features. Different phases of this method are illustrated in figure 2 a Identifying the Main Users of each Group By reducing accuracy multi-memb erships create problematic in the final modeling and lead to decisions that will ultimately be more based on probabilities than facts. Therefore, by identifying the main group of each user and ignoring multimemberships, the main users of each group will better be identified. We define user activity degree to figure out the 238 


level of activity for each user \(Equation 4\nd in case a user is more active in a certain group, he will be identified as a member of that group only and his other memberships in other groups will be ignored by the system  i i i i D C P  A\(G 4 A\(G i  is the degree of activity of user in i th group, P i is the number of posts sent by the user, C i is the number of comments given by the user to the posts in the group and D i is the duration of membership of the user. Therefore, any group with the highest degree of activity is considered as the user's main group. After this phase, multi-memberships were reduced to 22.6 Finally, since not all users are active in a group and we cannot use activity degree to determine single-memberships we took into account the similarity of user to other members of a certain group. The distance between each user and the cluster centroid was considered and the group whose user had the least distance, was regarded as the main group for that user. In other words, each user was assigned a group with which it had the most possible similarity. After all 1616 users belonged to one single group. Table I shows the number of single-memberships of 15 groups after assigning a main group to each b Creating Group Recommender System We offer recommendations based on user profiles; and since each user profile is made of their interests and features, the recommendations too, will be based on their interests. Dtree is used to recommend a main group to the user Furthermore, for our recommendations to be related to a user's main features, we used supervised entropy    Out of 52 primary features, 22 were identified as unrelated and only the 30 remaining features of user profiles were used in D-Tree classification. Association rules were used to provide a maximum number of two group recommendations to each user. Since 31.63% of users had multi-memberships and on average users in our SN were members of two groups, we recommended a list containing a pair of groups for each user; more groups could also be recommended. As a result, user multi-memberships in groups, which were ignored in identification of the main users for each group will again be influential D-tree to predict main group Problems like RSs are solved based on classification and prediction. One of the common methods in classification is D-tree; leaves represent classes and branches stand for combinations and conjunctions of features which consist a class. Various algorithms are applicable for Dtree; C5.0, C4.5 and CART are examples of such algorithms. These algorithms could create binary or multi-branched 13  In or der t o  create binary D-tree, we use C5.0 algorithm and boosting  h e data set ap plied to th is step includes user profiles and requires membership in one group for each user Association rules for determini ng groups related to the main group Association analysis is the discovery of association rules illustrating attribute-value conditions that occur frequently in a given set of I = {i 1 i 2 i n  is a set of n binary attribute called items. D = {t 1 t 2 t n  is a set of transactions calle d database. Each transaction t has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of items in I. each X Y rule is an implication where X, Y I and X  Y = 0 are defined. The set of X and Y items are called antecedent and consequent  Association rules could be extracted based on different parameters. In addition, we may select interesting rules out of extracted rules based on different criteria. Some of these evaluation metrics are objective such as confidence and support while others are subjective which include mutual information and lift We extract rules based on lift  confidence and mutual information metrics. The data set applied to this step include s user multi-memberships in groups, without considering no ise users. The data set used here is the same data set of the paper also used in other techniques. Here, groups are considered as data items and each users multi memberships are considered as a transaction 2 Hybrid technique 1 \(Rec6 in this technique, a combination of Rec5 and Rec3 is used. In this technique we defined an acceptable threshold for probability of the prediction based on D-tree; if the prediction by D-tree is more than the threshold, the prediction will count as acceptable; otherwise, the recommendation provided by Rec3 method will be considered as the main group for that user. Furthermore, a second group will be recommended based on the processes illustrated in the paper 3 Hybrid technique 2 \(Rec7 in this technique, Rec5 and Rec2 are used in combin ation. An acceptable threshold for the probability of recommendation based on D-tree is first defined; if the prediction by D-tree is more than threshold, the prediction is acceptable; Otherwise, the recommended group of Rec2 will be considered as the main group of the user; then the second group will be identified in the same manner as in Rec5 and it will be recommended to the user IV  R ESULTS The data set used throughout the paper and in all methods is a unique data set which we manually created as explained in section III. It includes 15 groups, 1616 users \(excluding noise users\ and 52 features for user profiles. In Rec5 method, based on supervised entropy, 30 features were selected. In general, we applied one fourth of data in the test phase and the rest of data was devoted to the train phase Sampling was randomly done. By setting support threshold to 5% and rule confidence threshold to 15%, all possible association rules were extracted. As a result, 66 rules by Rule Confidence and 65 rules by Information Difference ware extracted The average numbers of repetiti ve tests is illustrated in Table II. As shown in Table II, results have been presented based on different techniques. In addition, for Rec5, Rec6 239 


and Rec7, association rules are evaluated by different metrics of extracting and selecting interesting rules In the extracted association rules, users whose main group is morality and spirituality their second group is also morality and spirituality Furthermore, users interested in groups about revolution are also interested in religion and their second group is of that category. Accordingly, other users who are interested in groups about sports, youth literature, entertainment and social subjects are offered a group related to social topics V  C ONCLUSION The multiplicity of virtual groups and communities confuses users and makes it very difficult for them to join groups that perfectly suit their character and satisfy their needs; this eventually may lead to user boredom. The group RS explained in this paper was a solution for such problems by offering customized recommendations based on user features. Regarding the similarities between members of a group, this system identifies e ach users main group and applies D-tree classification method to recommend one as the main group with the highest priority. In addition, based on association rules, the system identifies one other group as related to user's main group and recommends it to him \(More groups could also be recommended\. Furthermore, in this method we may provide descriptions about the features of each group which is not possible in other common methods In this paper, rules extrac ted by confidence rule and information difference, have brought about recommendations with closely identical precision and coverage. Compared with the common methods, the techniques introduced in this paper provide better results and lack their limitations. Unlike CF and CB recommender system, this tec hnique, regardless of users activity degree in the network, could offer recommendations even to users who do not have any connections or memberships; this could be a great advantage over the previous techniques. In addition, this system could also recommend more than two groups. In the older methods Rec3 method had a better precision which is a natural phenomenon due to the fact that friends influence their friends Furthermore, since Rec6 hybrid technique provides recommendation based on users friends, it gives better results. Finally, Rec7 which is a combination of our hybrid method \(Rec 5\llaborative filtering has provided better re sults over Rec6 as well as other techniques The method of this paper could also have other applications; for example in content RSs where there is a great bulk of contents, such as libraries and weblogs; and in commercial systems which offer products and services to users. In future studies, to improve the precision of the prediction model, we mean to convert multiple features of user profiles to binary values. Other CF methods will also be studied R EFERENCES 1  Adamic, L.A., Buyukkokten, O., and Adar, E., A social network caught in the web, First Monday, vol. 8, issue 6, June 2003 2  Zhang, Y., Koren, J., Efficient Baye sian Hierarchical User Modeling for Recommendation Systems, Proc.

V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables 


where knowledge is synthetically summarized. The formed attractive and repulsive zones, based on human considerations and statistics, guarantee that potentially interesting knowledge will be discovered with decreasing by the way the search space REFERENCES 1] J.
