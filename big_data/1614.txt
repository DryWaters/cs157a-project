The notion of big data is \nefficiently leveraged through popular social networking sites nsuch as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. Twitter is a most \npopular micro-blogging website enriched with many research \nissues. The users are allowed to put their ideas and thoughts in \nthe form of messages called Tweets” in twitter. In this study, the \npurpose of gathering the location specific tweets is to understand nand surface the insights which are related to human dynamics. \nWe have employed the data stream mining approach to process \ngeo-spatial time invariant tweets in a distributed real-time \nenvironment to gain more useful information. Topic models were \nexplored for identifying a particular topic of interest or to extract nprudent information from the stream data. Our concentration is \non the evolution of different topics at different places, a location-\ntopic matrix is formed for the set of topics observed as most \npredominant for the specific locations.  Then a user graph is \ngenerated for the volatile topics that help in analyzing the users \nwho have tweeted or has been re-tweeted on a specific topic the \nmost. From the properties of the generated graph, the \ndisorientation of the topics is reported in the given locations by \nthe use of a sentimental analysis that deems the topic discussed \nas positive or negative. These analyzes have shown that there is a \npossibility to outwit the useless and most rampant negative issues \nspread mutely on a specific location which later creates \nunnecessary panic to the society.  \n \nKeywords-Big Data Analytics; Twitter streams; Stream data \nprocessing; Topic models; User graph;  \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \nTwitter is a micro blogging site that allows users to send \nand receive short messages called as tweets. Users generally \ninscribe these tweets to express their own interests and some \nuse these tweets to post messages that occasionally pose a nthreat to any countries security and integrity. In today’s \nglobal environment, location matters more than what many \npeople imagine. The location specific or geo-spatial tweets \ncan help track the physical assets better understand and \nprioritize the recovery efforts of natural disasters [1]. There \nare also users who misuse the micro blogging service and \nspread wrong information about people or company etc., \nwhich generates significant impact in a society.  Some prime \nadvantages which includes that the users via tweets post the ninformation during crisis or emergency which will alert the \nothers and also to avoid the major incidences Another \nexample is the incident of Japanese earthquakes where the \ntweets played a major role for bringing out benefits \(alerts  by exploring a fast streaming \nenvironment to capture the location-specific tweets and \nanalyze tactfully nThe concept of streaming the twitter data is closely \nassociated with handling big data that is the process of \nextracting knowledge structures from continuous and rapid \ndata streams. A data stream is an ordered sequence of \ninstances that can be read only once or a small number of \ntimes using limited computing and storage capabilities [3]. \nTwitter serves as a rich source of information for streaming \nactivities. Compare to other information sources, Twitter is \nup-to-date and reflects the current news and events \nhappening around the world on a faster phase. It is \npotentially valuable source of data that can be used to delve \ninto the thoughts of millions of people as they are uttering \nthem. Twitter makes these utterances immediately available \nin a data stream, which can be utilized for recent updates. \nHaving discussed about the advantages of streaming twitter \ndata, we provide a methodology of how twitter data is \nprobed in this study. \n      The main focus of our approach is localized to use the \ntwitter data for finding out the specific issues/topics that \nspreads in every location. These topics may also contribute \nfor being sensitive to the social integrity and security. Our \nsystem captures such topics and alerts the authority when \nsensitive topics increase immensely over a certain period of \ntime in a particular location. The overall system is \nrepresented in Fig 1.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1. An introductory overview of our system \n \n     The social network stream of data twitter data model as shown in Fig 1. This \nstream processing model understands the existence of \ndistinct topics in every location through the formation of \nlocation-topic matrix. From this matrix, the abnormal entries \nSocial network \nstream \nIntelligent \nStream \nprocessing \nmodel \nDisorientation \nreporting \n \n2013 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems \(RAICS involved are represented as nodes and \nthe tweets shared between them as edges which aids in the \ngeneration 


of user graphs. From the understandings of \ndeviation in structural properties of the graph and the napplication of sentiment analysis, the final disorientation is \nreported in the given location for a specific topic. Such \ntopics may relate to detrimental of social integrity, any \ncompany or an individual’s personal integrity. \n  Our proposed system consists of two different modes of \nprocessing namely, offline and online processing. The \npurpose of offline processing is to make the system learn \nand get accustomed to the data before the actual real-time \nimplementation. \nThus, in the offline processing, the topic modeling is \napplied to understand the topics and to obtain a bag of \nkeywords for every topic. A log linear regression model is nemployed on the training data to explore various thresholds \nfrom the accumulated structural properties of a user graph. \nIn the real-time processing, the latent topics and the bag of \nkeywords are applied to categorize the tweets while the \nthresholds are used for analyzing the user graphs.     \nII. RELATED STUDIES  \n      The tweets retrieved from twitter social network site \ncould serve for the various purposes like those of nidentification of the important topics, as a medium for the \ncommon chat between various users, to understand the \nsituation of the companies, market studies for business \nanalytics and also for product recommendations The \nbusiness value of analyzing the tweets for the research work \nis highly resourceful because nowadays twitter is gaining \npopularity as one of the leading social networking site [12].  \n     We also found from the studies that analyzing twitter data \ncould also sometimes lead to downfall/upliftment of  a \ncompany's operations on a specific location [4].  These \nstudies have created more interest in analyzing the twitter ndata to obtain the geo-spatial information and thereby the \nmost prevailing sensitive topic in that location The idea of \nanalyzing the geo-spatial tweets was obtained from the \nOklahoma grass fires. During Oklahoma grass fires, the \ntweets were used to identify information that may contribute \nto situational awareness [5 n     In this study, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation \n\(LDA  topics and the \nrespective keywords. Topic models are considered to be \npowerful tools to identify latent text patterns in the content. \nThey are applied in a wide range of text processing areas \nincluding the recent work on Twitter. Latent variable topic \nmodels have been applied widely to problems in text \nmodeling, and require no manually constructed training \ndata. These models distill collections of text documents \(a \ncollection of a number of location-specific tweets in this \ncase nsimilar documents, this set of related words are referred to \nas “topics.” The idea of using topic modeling has been \nderived from the studies of Weng et al. [7] and Ramage et \nal. [8] who have used the topic modeling to infer topics from \ntwitter and other micro blogs.  \n     After collecting the bag of words and the related topics \n\(that are to be used as the acquired knowledge processed in a \nreal-time distributed environment in our approach. The \ndistributed processing is achieved by employing the Storm \nframework [9]. The storm is an easy, reliable framework \nand provides faster fault-tolerant distributed computing. \nThe idea of using storm framework in our approach has \nbeen obtained from the study: The storm topology is a graph \nof spouts and bolts that are connected with stream \ngroupings The stream is the core abstraction in Storm. A \nstream is an unbounded sequence of tuple that is processed nand created in parallel in a distributed fashion.  A spout is a \nsource of streams in a topology. All processing in storm \ntopologies is done in bolts. Bolts can do anything from \nfiltering, functions aggregations, joins, talking to databases, \nand more. Bolts can do simple stream transformations [9]. \nThe storm framework used for the stream data processing is \nexplained in Section 4.1. \n     In order to track the evolution of topics in a location, a \nsliding window mechanism [5] is employed to gather all the \nnew tweets and accumulate them. After a certain period of \ntime, the accumulated tweets are processed in the distributed nframework. This process is carried out in a continual fashion \nfor once in every thirty minutes or so. Thus the storm \ntopology updates its knowledge on topics and relevant \nkeywords regularly in accordance with the sliding window. \n     After categorizing the tweets using the topic model, a \nlocation-topic matrix is formed to keep track of the fast \nevolving topics in a specific location. When a topic evolves \nvery rapidly, a user graph is generated with tweets as edges \nand users as nodes. According to the studies by Gabielkov et \nal 13], a graph is nothing but a diagram showing the \nrelationship between quantities that exists. This form the nbasis of our idea of using the user graphs for determining \nthe topic disorientation in the study. A combination of \nvarious graphical properties is used in our approach to \ndetermine the disorientation. The approach of using this \ncombined graphical property to determine the disorientation \nof the topic is explained in section 5.  \nIII. OFFLINE PROCESSING OF THE DATA \nThe main purpose of this part of implementation is to nobtain topics and various keywords under every topic. The \ntopics are learned through the topic modeling approach. The \nlist of topics obtained are used for the real-time processing \nmodel where the occurrence of disorientation is checked at \nregular intervals. The system overview is shown in Fig 2. It \nshould be noted 


that the offline processing is represented as \na topic modeling system because it forms the bag of \nkeywords for topics regularly to aid the real-time processing \nin categorizing the tweets. So whenever a few new tweets nare left out without getting categorized under a specific \ntopic, they are forwarded to the topic modeling system that \ntakes the required action like formation of a new topic or \ninclusion of new keywords under an already existing topic. \n \n228\n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2. System Overview \n \n    The input test data comprises of three months of data \nretrieved from twitter. This data is fed to the topic modeling napproach which groups the topics and the keywords and \nupdates them in a topic database which is used as an nacquired knowledge base  in the real time processing model. \nThe topics are important to understand and learn the \nissues/discussions that pops from various locations. The \noffline processing model is a continuous learning model, i.e \nwhen the real time processing is done on the stream of \ntweets, the location-topic matrix is generated. This matrix \nspecifies the number of tweets in a given location under a \nspecific topic. The tweets which do not fall under any \ncategory of topics is again fed back as input to the topic \nmodeling approach that takes a corresponding action as \ndiscussed earlier so that its output is used in the further real \ntime processing model. Similarly the threshold values were \nfixed for the location-topic matrix and combined graphical \nproperties that are continuously updated from the real-time \nprocessing. \n     By analyzing large amounts of tweets offline, threshold \nvalue for the matrix was formulated as a function on three \ndifferent variables namely, location of tweeted user, topic of \nthe tweet and timestamp of the tweet. A stepwise linear \nregression is applied on this data to produce an equation of \nthe form: \ny = c1*x1 + c2*x2 cn*xn         \(1 independent term xi. In our analysis, \nwe found three contributing graphical properties which were \ncombined using different coefficients to form a single \naggregated value as follows: \n \nValue = 0.631*Avg. Path Length 0.326*Avg. Clustering \nCoefficient + 0.255*Avg. Degree         \(2 properties [14] mentioned \nabove are defined as follows: \n• Average path length is defined as the average nnumber of steps along the shortest paths for all \npossible pairs of nodes in a network graph. \n• Clustering coefficient is a measure of the \nlikelihood to which nodes in a network tend to \ncluster together. A higher clustering coefficient \nindicates a greater ‘cliquishness’. \n• Degree is the count of the number of ties to other \nactors in the network. For a group of nodes this is \nthe average degree of the nodes within. \nThese coefficients were set in a way to calculate the \ndeviations. The topic modeling used in this offline model is nexplained below. \nA.  Topic Modeling \nThe topic modeling uses LDA method in our approach to \nidentify the important topics from the input test data as \nillustrated in Fig 3. The learning used in topic modeling is nunsupervised which requires no labeled data. Topic models \ncan be used in text summarization, document classification, \ninformation retrieval, link prediction and collaborative \nfiltering [10]. \nThe input location-specific tweets are gathered as text \ncontained in a number of documents. Each document \nconsists of large amounts of tweets and all such documents \nare given as input to the LDA topic modeling as shown in \nFig 4. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3.  Illustration of LDA \n \nThe formula for Latent Dirichlet Allocation [6] is given as \nfollows:  \n \nP\(W, Z 3 P\(?i j Zj,t | ?j Wj,t | ?z j,t 3 all documents. \n? = Distribution of topics in a document. \n? = Distribution of words in a topic. \n? = Prior weight of a topic in a document \(Constant Constant topics are retrieved through LDA method, the bag \nof words is also obtained for every topic which is used in the \nfinal comparison for identifying the most severe topic in a \nspecific-location. \nInput data  Topic nmodeling \nsystem \nThe list of \ntopics and \nkeywords \nUpdated \ntopics \ndatabase \nReal time \nprocessing \nsystem nDisorienta\ntion \nreporting \nsystem \nContinuous learning of topics \n229\n \nDocument 1 Tweet 1,1 Tweet 1,2  \n nTweet 1,n \n \nDocument 2 \n: \nTweet 2,1 Tweet 2,2  \n... \nTweet 2,n \n \n: \nDocument \nm \n \nTweet m,1 \n \nTweet m,2 n... \n \nTweet m,n \n \nFig. 4.  A Document-Tweet structure \nB. Obtaining the keywords under every topic \n After the topics are generated, the topic modeling \ncollects the keywords under every topic. The accuracy of the \nkeywords under the topics is also checked for effectiveness. \nAn example of the bag of words collected for every topic is \ndepicted below in Fig 5. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 5.  An overview of topics and keywords \nIV. REAL TIME PROCESSING MODEL \n     The real time processing model is diagrammatically nshown in Fig 6. We use the storm framework in our \napproach for this model. The overall idea is to find the most \nprevalent topics in the location and report if there are any \ndisorientations related to the observed topics/issues. The \ncomplete processing is explained in detail in the following \nsections. The sliding window mechanism [5] is applied here \nand the whole process happens continually for every thirty-\nminute period of 


time. Given below is the detailed \nexplanation of the different blocks used in this model. \nA.   Storm Framework \n     Our process flow comprises of processing the stream \ndata using the spouts and bolts in the storm framework. The \ntwitter spout emits the stream of tweets which is sent to the \nfurther sequence of bolts for processing. The explanation of \nspouts and bolts was given in section 2. The various bolts \nused for the sequence of operations are the preprocessing \nbolt, matrix formation bolt, user graph generation bolt and nsentiment analysis bolt. The first bolt parses the stream of \ntweets and retrieves the tweets with user name tweet id, \ntweet text, location and timestamp. Then the stop words \n\(words like the, a, an, or etc removed from the tweet \ntext to retrieve keywords from the tweets. The category of \nthe tweet is found by comparing with the keywords obtained \nfrom the offline learning topic database. The output \nobtained from this bolt is the tweet and its category which is \nthen fed into the matrix formation bolt which forms the nlocation-topic matrix for the stream of tweets. On detection \nof abnormality, the output of the matrix is fed to the user \ngraph generation bolt that generates the graph for the topic \nand uses the graphical properties for second-level \nabnormality detection. The sentiment analysis bolt carries \nout a sentimental analysis on the topic that was deemed \nabnormal in the previous level to report on disorientation of \nthe topic, if found n                                                              \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 6.  Block diagram explaining the real time \nprocessing model \nB.   Obtaining the topics from tweets \n     The tweets are parsed and stop words are removed from \nthe tweets. The left over keywords in the tweets are \ncompared with the keywords that are obtained from the \noffline processing model. When the keywords match, the \ntweets are tagged under the specific topics to which the \nkeywords are associated with and from this data; the nlocation-topic matrix is formed. The detailed explanation of \nthe location-topic matrix and other similar processes are \nprovided in the following sections. \nC. Formation of location – topic matrix \n    The location-topic matrix is a matrix which is used in \nunderstanding the abnormality of a topic in a given location. \nThe input fed to this block is the tweet, its category \(topic the columns as the topics \nand rows as the location. The rows are filled with the topics \nobtained from the offline processing model and the number \nof tweets under every topic in every location is the value of \nthe individual cells. \n \n \nTopics \nBooks Entertain\nment \nPolitics \nFiction \nThriller \nScience \nComics \nYear nBook\nMovies \nGame -\nshows \nSports \nRestaurants \nBoycott \nDisorder \nProtest \nOutcry \n \nTweets \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n n \nReport \n       Disorientation \n \nStorm Framework \nObtaining \ntopics from \ntweets\nFormation of nlocation-topic \nmatrix \nGeneration \nof user \ngraphs \nSentiment \nAnalysis \n230\nTable I. Structure of Location-topic matrix \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom Table I, the number of tweets under every topic in \nevery location is filled as a cell entry in the matrix. There is \na threshold value set for the number of tweets from the \noffline learning, which is continually updated through the \nreal time processing too. So, when the number exceeds the \nthreshold, we tag it as abnormal and generate the user \ngraphs only for those topics. The threshold value is flexible \nenough to be set by the stakeholders. The explanation of the \nuser graph generation is given below. \nD.  Generation of user graphs \nWhile generating the user graph for the particular category, \nthe users who have tweeted form the nodes of the graph and \nthe edges represent the tweets and retweets. The topics \nwhich are detected as abnormal from the matrix are \nvisualized in the form of the graphs. The various graphical \nproperties associated with the graph are calculated and used \nin the detection of disorientation. There is a threshold value \nfor the graphical properties too obtained through a step-wise nlinear regression in the offline learning model. So, when the \nvalue of the accumulated graphical properties exceeds the \nthreshold, sentiment analysis is done on those tweets. This is \nexplained in the below section nE. Finding disorientation of the topics \nFrom the user graphs, when the combined graphical \nproperties exceed the threshold, the sentiment analysis is \ndone on the tweets. The sentiment is the context of the \nwords described in the positive or negative sense. Sentiment \nanalysis involves classifying opinions in text into categories \nlike positive or negative often with an implicit category of \nneutral. Some examples for the negative sentiment words \nare “don’t like, dislike” etc... and the positive sentiment \nwords are “happy, good etc.. For example, if the sample \ntweet was “ I dislike reading but like movies” , after topic \ncategorization and sentiment analysis we find that the tweet \nis spoken on negative sense towards books but much \npositive sense towards entertainment. We have used the \nAFINN model [11] for prediction of the sentiments of the ntweets. The value from the AFINN model is in the range \nbetween -5 to +5. When the negative sentiment is found \nhigher on the tweets, the disorientation is reported on the \nlocation for the said topics. This process happens \ncontinuously for every five minutes time period as the \ngraphical property gets updated. The sentiment analysis in \nour approach plays an important role in predicting the \ndisorientation of the topic which is explained in Section 5.  \nV. EVALUATION AND RESULTS \n  Ideally, we would like to evaluate our 


algorithms with \nlarge volumes of big data by making use of the real stream \nof tweets through twitter API on a sliding window with 30 \nminute time period. However, since no such patterns exist \nwith real time tweets, we emulate such a system by adding \n93,350 location and time specific synthetic tweets \n\(consisting of both positive and negative sentimental tweets T for two locations \(L ncompared with the keywords obtained from the offline \nprocessing and the location-topic matrix is formed thus. \n \nTable II. Location-topic matrix for an input dataset of tweets \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe threshold value was obtained from the offline \nprocessing model by expressing each cell value in the \nmatrix as a function of three variables namely, location, \ntopic and time of the tweet. The number of tweets in every ncell of the matrix is compared with a corresponding \nthreshold value. From Table II, the number of tweets under \nthe category Politics is predominantly more than the other \ntweets. This matrix and the threshold value are updated \ncontinuously for every thirty-minute period of time as the \ntweets are retrieved continually for every thirty minutes. \nThese real time details are updated into offline model \nlearning for fixing new threshold values. From Table II, we \nobserved that the number of tweets under the topic Politics \nat Location L1 is predominantly more than the threshold \nvalue so the graph is generated for the same to check for the noccurrence of disorientation. The graph was found to be the \none given at Fig 7. \n      On analyzing the graph, we found the values of avg. \npath length, avg. clustering coefficient and avg. degree to be \n2.391 0.459 and 48.683 respectively. The value of \nregression equation \(2 ngreater than the threshold obtained by means of offline \nlearning model. Further analysis was carried on by ncomparing every keyword found on the tweets relating to \nthe specific topic “Politics” with the AFINN model 11]. \nThe accumulated sum of all the compared values was found \n          T         Topic 1 Topic 2    ……… Topic n \nL \n \nLocation 1   LT[1,1]        LT[1,2] LT[1,n] \n \n \nLocation 2   LT[2,1 LT[2,2] LT[2,n] \n     . \n     . \nLocation m  LT[m,1]        LT[m,2] LT[m,n]\n          T         Books Politics                Others \nL \n \nL1                  20210                   32250 15300 \n \n \n \nL2                  25320                   7230                      13040 \n231\nto be a very large negative value and hence the same is \nreported as disorientation at location L1. \n \n \nFig. 7.  Graph generated for the topic Politics at Location L1 \nfrom Twitter data \n    A similar analysis was carried out on the gathered \nLinkedIn dataset by finding out the various types of user’s \nsentiments over a number of products advertised in a \nspecific event that happened during the years 2012 and \n2013. The dataset consisted of typical information relating \nto a specific product and the reviews posted by a number of \nusers.  There were a total of about 15000 reviews posted by \n793 unique users about 15 different products. All the \nreviews regarding one such product were collected in a \ndocument consisting of about 1500 reviews. The sentiment \nof each review present in the document was analyzed using \nAFINN [11] and categorized as a positive or negative nreview. After the analysis of all the reviews, the results were \nrepresented in a 3D-pyramidal type bar graph for a quick \nknowledge grasp nproduct in LinkedIn \n      It was found that there was an increase in the number of \nboth positive and negative reviews from the year 2012 to \n2013. The extraction of negative reviews from the whole \nwas useful in determining the bugs or problems experienced \nby various types of users, so that the discussed problems can nbe corrected before the next event. Thus the disorientation \npresent in a product was reported and can be rectified by \nusing this process. \nVI. CONCLUSION \n     Our model basically identifies the geo-spatial topics that \ncould affect the social integrity and take preventive actions \nfor the same. This method could also help in business \nanalysis and further can also be extensively used for \nidentifying an organization’s/product’s improvement as \ndepicted in the case of LinkedIn data analysis. This kind of \napproach could also be useful in the social network analysis \nrecommendations. Based on the exploratory study on a \ntwitter, we would like to extend our studies on other social \nnetworking sites as well. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Matt Gentile.

Hama’s BSPMaster, on the other hand, waits for all\nprocesses to ?nish but does not appear to have timely heartbeat\nnoti?cation built-in.\nThese ?ndings lead us to the recommendation that under the\nassumption of high probability of node failure and extreme\nlong running jobs, a conservative choice of frameworks is\nsuitable.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we presented a thorough study of modern big\ndata frameworks and their application to graph algorithms.\nWe selected the k-core algorithm and adapted it to each\nplatform. We executed the algorithm both in a distributed\ncloud settings as well as on CPU rich multicore machines. Our\n?ndings con?rm the validity of these improved frameworks.\nEach of them improves over Hadoop in terms of execution\ntime. However, from a programming paradigm point of view,\na vertex centric framework is the better ?t for graph related\nproblems. Not only is the ease of programming an important\npoint, as the focus can be close to the sketched algorithm. The\nperformance of vertex-centric frameworks is not matched by\nMap/Reduce-based frameworks, even by improved ones, such\nas Stratosphere Therefore, we clearly recommend one of the\nPregel-inspired frameworks for graph processing, although the\nresilience of those frameworks has room for improvements.\nCompared to Hadoop, Stratosphere enhanced the situation\nenormously, thanks to their ?exible programming contracts\nconcept. For graph algorithms, the MATCH operator as a\nmean to split input into worksets and graph input yields clear\nperformance gains. An important announced, but still missing\nfeature of Stratosphere will be the PACT compiler support\nfor worksets. With that feature available, Stratosphere might\nbe able to catch up to vertex centric frameworks, using highly\noptimized data?ows; however, the ease of programming might\nstill be an issue. We therefore recommend a re-evaluation at\nthat point.\nAnother outcome of this work is an improved dynamic\nprogramming algorithm, which greatly improves the runtime\nof k-core. Future work on graph algorithms might consider\nthe ?ltering concept as a possible source for improvements.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work has been partially supported by the EIT Activity\n“Europa” n. 12115 and by an AWS in Education Research\nGrant Award and by\n66\nREFERENCES\n[1] Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2  and A.

stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
