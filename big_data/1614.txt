The performance of MapReduce is \ngreatly affected by the scheduling efficiency, which needs to \nconsider both the parallelism of processing and overhead of \ndata transmission Lots of researches only focus on optimizing \nscheduling mechanisms or data storage strategies to reduce the noverhead of data transmission in big data applications. The \nanalysis of MapReduce carried out doesn’t consider the \noverhead of data transmission sufficiently. This paper \nproposes a divisible load scheduling model to describe the data \ntransmission and task execution in MapReduce.

By expressing the computation as map and reduce \nphases, MapReduce makes applications parallelized \nautomatically and executed efficiently on large clusters. Now \nMapReduce and its open-source implementation Hadoop are \nwidely used in many areas[2-5]. \nThe overhead of data transmission affects the \nperformance of MapReduce greatly[6-11]. To exploit the \nparallelism of a cluster, MapReduce tends to process data \nsets with lots of machines simultaneously. But as storage of \ndata sets can’t fulfill all requirements of parallel processing \nin advance, many nodes have to process data sets stored \nremotely. \nIn order to reduce overhead of data transmission, native \nMapReduce preferentially schedules tasks to machines with \ncorresponding input data[1]. Many researches have also been \ncarried out by optimizing scheduling mechanisms[7-9] or data \nstorage strategies[10,11]. Although these methods improve the \nperformance of MapReduce, they only focus on solving \nproblem with particular techniques or in special \nenvironments. J Berliska et al. have analyzed the \nMapReduce computations as a divisible load scheduling \nproblem[12]. But their research mainly concerns the \nprecedence constraint between mapping and reducing \noperations, the time needed by data transmission is treated as \na constant. As a result, the difference between reading data \nfrom local disks and requiring data from remote nodes is not \nspecified. \nDivisible load theory is a tractable methodology for \nmodeling of partitionable applications for parallel and \ndistributed processing[13]. It assumes that the computation \nand communication loads can be partitioned arbitrarily and \nscheduled with no precedence constraints among all \nexecution machines. The map tasks or reduce tasks in \nMapReduce can be regarded as divisible loads respectively, \nwhich is described in section II. Although the map phase \nmust precede the reduce phase, MapReduce can be regarded \nas a divisible load scheduling problem with certain nprecedence constraint[12]. \nThis paper proposes a divisible load scheduling model to \ndescribe the data transmission and task execution in \nMapReduce. The map and reduce phases in MapReduce are \nanalyzed with divisible load theory in detail. By abstracting \nthe task allocation and corresponding data transmission as nscheduling from multiple input sources and regarding \nmap/reduce tasks as divisible loads, the theoretical model of \nMapReduce is presented. As it is observed that performance \nof reduce phase largely depends on the map phase, this paper \nfocuses on minimizing the execution time of map tasks. An \noptimal distribution of data sets among input sources and \nscheduling of map loads are obtained with linear \nprogramming. With the established model, the performance \nof map phase is evaluated under different environments and \nseveral instructional principles are given for input data \ndistribution and loads scheduling. \nII. OVERVIEW OF MAPREDUCE \nMapReduce divides computations into the map and \nreduce phases. In the map phase, tasks simultaneously \nprocess the input data as key/value pairs and generate \nintermediate key/value pairs. Then tasks in the reduce phase \ngather and process the intermediate pairs according \nintermediate keys. The detailed computation principles of \nmap and reduce phases can be reviewed in works of Jeffrey \nDean[1] and T White[5]. \nIn Fig. 1, overview of a MapReduce processing \ncomposed of six steps is described. In the first two steps, \nscheduler of MapReduce allocates map and reduce tasks to \nnodes, which are called mappers and reducers respectively. \nThen mappers start to process corresponding input data sets.\n2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering\n978-0-7695-5096-1/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CSE.2013.188\n1263\n \nFigure 1.  Execution overview of MapReduce \nAs shown in Fig. 1, a mapper may has no local data set, thus \nit has to acquire its input data by data transmission, which is \nthe step \(3 a mapper parses input data to key/value \npairs with the map function in user program, it partitions the nintermediate pairs with partitioning function and writes them \nto local disks in step \(4 


finished, the \nmapper forwards locations of intermediate pairs to the \nscheduler. Then scheduler notifies locations information to \ncorresponding reducers and activates reducers to read \nintermediate pairs from mappers’ local disks with step \(5 groups them according the keys. The sorted pairs of each \nkey are processed with the reduce function provided in user \nprogram and the results are written to output files as \ndescribed by step \(6 above description, data transmission \nappears during two periods. One period happens when \nmappers are allocated input data that are not stored locally. \nIn this case, these mappers have to require input data from ncorresponding storage nodes and start processing after \nreceiving needed data completely. That will degrade the \nperformance of MapReduce seriously as the size of input \ndata in data-intensive applications is big in common. \nAnother period is that reducers read intermediate pairs from \nlocal disks of mappers. When reducers are scheduled, they \nrequest intermediate pairs, process them and write the results \nback. The size of intermediate pairs transferred between \nmappers and reducers is determined by the output of map \ntasks and partitioning function. \nThe MapReduce is a divisible load scheduling problem \nwith certain precedence constraint[12]. Map or reduce tasks \nprocess data sets as keys with the same map or reduce \nfunction, and these keys are completely independent and can \nbe processed in any order. Although reduce tasks start nprocessing only after getting intermediate pairs generated by \nmap tasks, the precedence constraint is confirmed when the \nallocation of map tasks and partitioning function are given. \nAccordingly, MapReduce can be modeled with divisible load \ntheory. \nIII. THEORETICAL MODEL OF MAPREDUCE \nIn this paper, there are three kinds of nodes, which are \nthe scheduler, nodes for executing map/reduce tasks and \nstorage nodes. All these nodes are assumed to have one or \nmore processing units, local storage and network interface. \nWith processing unit\(s local storage is used to store input data sets by \nstorage nodes and intermediate data by other nodes. Network ninterface makes any two of these nodes can communicate \nwith each other. \nTwo types of communication model between nodes, \nsequential and concurrent, have been studied so far[14]. In the \nsequential model, each node can only communicate with one \nother node at a time. But in the concurrent model, a node can \ncommunicate with all other nodes simultaneously[15, 16]. The \nconcurrent communication can be implemented with a \nprocessor who uses a processing unit to maintain an output \nbuffer for each communication link[14]. In addition, the ndistributed file system for MapReduce uses replications to \nprovide data availability and reliability[5, 17 which makes a \nnode can get the same input data from multiple storage \nnodes. In this paper, it is assumed that processing unit\(s storage nodes are identified by an ‘A’ followed by a \ntag number between 1 to m, and mapper/reducer are nidentified by a ‘P’ followed by a tag number between 1 to n. \nAs nodes can execute both map and reduce tasks in common, \nmappers and reducers in this paper are the same nodes in a \ncluster. In the following discussion mapper/reducer and \nnode are used alternatively according to the context. \nTo facilitate describing the theoretical model of \nMapReduce, following definitions are given: \nm: the number of storage nodes for a MapReduce \nprocessing; \nn: the number of mappers for a MapReduce processing; \nr: the number of reducers for a MapReduce processing; \n1264\nS: the size of total input data in a MapReduce processing; \nSi: the size of input data stored in storage node Ai; \nf: the size multiplicity factor of map’s result relative to \ninput data; \nbt the computation startup time of a node, same for all \nnodes; \nti: the time needed by the node Pi to process a unit of \nlocal input data in a map task and writes intermediate pairs to \nlocal disk; \nrti: the time needed by the node Pi to process a unit of \ndata in a reduce task and writes result to output files; \nwij: the time needed by transmitting a unit of data \nbetween node Ai and node Pj; wii is zero; \nrwij: the time needed by transmitting a unit of data \nbetween node Pi and node Pj; rwii is zero; \nTi: the time needed by the node Pi to finish allocated map \ntasks; \nRTi: the time needed by the node Pi to finish allocated \nreduce tasks; \nLi: the size of local input data processed by node Pi; \nRij: the size of input data stored in node Ai but processed nby another node Pj; \nThe flow of a MapReduce processing can be described as \nFig. 2. Firstly, the scheduler allocates tasks to mappers and \nreducers. The user program of applications and related input \ndata locations need to be submitted to scheduler. Then \nscheduler allocates tasks with chosen scheduling algorithm. \nBy default, when the scheduler detects an idle mapper or \nreducer, it actives this mapper/reducer by forwarding the \nprogram and input data locations. In this paper, it is assumed \nthat every participating mapper/reducer gets all needed \nprogram and information in the first execution, which takes \ntime bt. Because the concurrent communication model is \nadopted, all nodes finish startup at the same time, as shown \nby the “start” in Fig 2. \nIn the second phase, map phase, mappers require input \ndata, process it with obtained map function in user program, \nsplit intermediate pairs into r pieces for reducers and write \nthem to local disks. Each mapper may 


be allocated many \nmap tasks, whose number is about 100 in general[1, 5]. In this \npaper, map tasks allocated to a node are classified by the \nstorage nodes of tasks’ input data. The map tasks whose \ninput data is on the same storage node are represented with a \ncombined map task for they spend the same time on \ntransmitting and processing a unit of data. \nIn node Pj, it is assumed that the map task for local input \ndata processes Lj units of data and the map task for input \ndata stored in node Ai processes Rij units of data. Both Lj and \nRij can be zero. It is worth noting that a node gets input data \nonly from the initial storage nodes, and input data got from \nstorage nodes can’t be forwarded to other nodes. The Rij and \nwij are set to zero when the Ai is the same node with Pj, so \nthe total input data size of tasks processed by node Pj is: \nLj+R1j+ R2j Rmj. Node Pj spends time Lj*tj on \nprocessing Lj units of data and writing intermediate pairs to \nlocal disks. For input data required from node Ai, the time \nfor processing is composed of data transmission time and \nmap execution time, which are Rij*wij and Rij*tj respectively. \nAs a result, the time needed by node Pj for executing map \ntasks is represented as   11\n \nIn the reduce phase, scheduler actives reducers to read \nintermediate pairs and execute tasks as long as corresponding \nintermediate pairs are received. The intermediate pairs \ngenerated by a mapper are partitioned with partitioning \nfunction into r pieces, so each reducer gets one piece of \nthem. To simplify the theoretical model, it is assumed that \nthese r pieces are equal in this paper. As the size of input \ndata processed by mapper Pj is Lj +R1j+ R2j+ ……+ Rmj, the \nsize of generated intermediate pairs is f*\(Lj+R1j+ R2j n……+Rmj Lj+R1j+ R2j+ ……+Rmj each \nmapper. So for reducer Pi, the time that spent on transmitting \ndata from mapper Pj is rwji*f*\(Lj+R1j+R2j+ ……+Rmj Lj+R1j+ R2j+ \n……+Rmj The Rij and rwij are set to zero when the Pi is \nthe same node with Pj. Therefore, the whole time needed by nthe reduce tasks allocated to node i is represented as: \n \nFigure 2.

The reduce \nphase will be studied in the future work. In model \nestablished, the failures of task execution and backup tasks \nare not considered independently. As the backup tasks are \nused to cope with slow or failed tasks, they can be simulated \nby increasing the size of Si to a certain degree. \nIV. SCHEDULING LOADS FROM MULTIPLE INPUT nSOURCES \nThis section optimizes the input data distribution and \nloads scheduling in the map phase of MapReduce. The \nallocation of map tasks and corresponding data transmission \nare abstracted as scheduling divisible loads from multiple \ninput sources. By aiming to minimize the execution time of \nmap phase, the optimal distribution of input data and \nscheduling of map loads are presented as linear \nprogramming problem based on the model of MapReduce \ndescribed in section III. \nA. Loads from Multiple Input Sources \nIn traditional divisible load theory, schedulers are \nresponsible for sending program and related input data to nnodes. And these schedulers are regarded as sources. But in \nthe model of MapReduce, the scheduler only sends program \nand locations of input data to mapper/reducer. Compared \nwith the overhead of input data transmission, the cost of \nscheduling is little and simplified as a constant in this paper. \nAs storage nodes are used to provide input data for mappers, \nthey can be regarded as input sources. As a result, the map ntasks can be abstracted as loads from multiple input sources. \nThe input data are distributed among storage nodes and \nallocated to mappers in scheduling. The input data are \nassumed can be distributed in storage nodes arbitrarily in this \npaper. When all input data sets stored in storage nodes have \nbeen processed, the map phase of MapReduce is finished. So \nthe total size of input data exported by storage node Ai \nshould be equal to the size of input data sets stored by it, \nwhich is Si. It is possible that a storage node is scheduled to nprovide data for any mapper. As described in the section III, \na node gets input data only from the initial storage nodes, \nand input data got from storage nodes can’t be forwarded to \nother nodes. So each node Pj has m input sources.  \nAs a result, the data distribution and loads scheduling in \nmap phase can be abstracted as the Fig. 3. Storage nodes Ai \nand mappers Pj can be the same machines in MapReduce \ncluster[1, 5, 17]. To simplify the following discussion, it is \nassumed that all storage nodes are also mappers and storage \nnodes are numbered as the first m nodes, so the Ai and Pi \nrefer to the same node for all i from 1 to m. Obviously the m \nis smaller or equal to n. The dotted lines between a storage \nnode and a mapper represents that the mapper requires input \ndata from the storage node. Each storage node may emit at \nmost n dotted lines and each mapper may be pointed by at \nmost m dotted lines. When the storage node and mapper of a \ndotted line are the same node, it means that the mapper \nrequires input data stored in local. Otherwise, the mapper \nrequires 


input data stored by another node. \n \nFigure 3.  Data transmission from multiple input sources \nB. Optimal Input Data Distribution and Loads Scheduling \nAs the proposition proved in divisible load theory, all \nworkers participating in the computation must finish \ncomputing simultaneously in any optimal solution[18]. It can \nbe explained simply as follow: if there exits any idle node in \nthe execution, loads can be partitioned further and \ntransferred from busy nodes to idle nodes, so the execution \ntime can be reduced. \nIn the problem of this paper, the optimal solution is \nachieved when all mappers finish processing allocated map \ntasks at the same time. The optimal input data distribution Si \nis the sum of Li and Rijs\(j is from 1 to n except i nnode Pi. The optimal loads scheduling under given Si is \nachieved by adding constraints that the sum of Li and Rijs\(j is \nfrom 1 to n except i data and processing these data. With the \ndenotations defined in section III, the time T1 needed by the \nmap phase of node P1 is: \n 1 unnecessary variables, the suffix of L is \nlimited to integers from 1 to m. And Rij exists only when the nvalue of i is between 1 and m, and the value of j is between 1 \nand n. Additionally, the i and j in Rij should not be equal. \nWhen the number of node is bigger than m, the node has no \nlocal input data. Then the time of node P\(m+1 m+1       2 optimal scheduling of loads is achieved when all \nmappers finish processing allocated map loads at the same ntime, so n-1 equations can be obtained as follows:  \nThe equations of nodes P\(k-1 are: \n             kik\nk\nm\nki\nik\nk\ni\nikk\nm\nki\nkiki\nk\ni\nkikik\nm\nki\nki\nk\ni\nkik\nwRwR\ntRRLwR\nwRtRRL\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n11\n2\n1\n1111\n2\n1\n11\n n**\n**\n\(3 m+1        4 equation of other nodes, for example node P\(q-1         5 by \nall nodes should be equal to S, which is the size of total input \ndata.

The last \nequation means that the size of loads executed by all nodes \nshould be equal to, the size of input data, S. \nWhen the input data distribution is fixed, the optimal \nloads scheduling can be solved with the linear programming \nproblem \(9 only replacing the equation \(14 15 nk\nn\nkj\nkj\nk\nj\nkjk SRRL =++ \n+=\n?\n= 1\n1\n1\n \(16 17 above m equations mean that the size of input data \nexported by storage node Ai should be equal to the size of ninput data stored by it, which is Si. So the optimal scheduling \nof loads represented with Li and Rijs can be solved with this \nlinear programming problem. \nV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION \nThe performance of map phase in MapReduce is \nevaluated in this section. By solving the linear programming \nin the above section, the optimal distribution of input data Si, \nand scheduling of loads represented with Li and Rij under \ndifferent environments are given. Different environments \nmean that at least one of the parameters including S, m, n, ti nand wij is different. \nAccording the instructions and parameter settings in \nfoundation research[1,12], the 


default parameters are set as \nfollows in this paper: the size of an input data set is 64MB \nand each map task is allocated to process an input data set; \nthe S is 10,000*64MB, so there are 10,000 map tasks in this nMapReduce processing; there are 100 nodes in the \nMapReduce cluster and 10 of them are storage nodes, so nn=100 and m=10; by default, any node needs 50 seconds to \nprocess a map task and the transmission of 64MB input data \nbetween any two nodes needs 5 seconds, which means ti=50s \nand wij=5s. The time of startup is ignored for it is a constant \nand very small under different environments. Without \nspecific explanations, the variables are set to their default \nvalues. \nIn this paper, the linprog function[19] in Matlab is used to nsolve the linear programming problems. Random integers are \ngenerated with the randi function[20] in Matlab so they are \nuniformly distributed pseudorandom integers. As the input \ndata size of a map task is set to 64MB, the Li, Rij and Si in \nthe solution can be decimals. They can be rectified to \n1267\nintegers by changing the input data size of divisible map \ntasks. \nA. Distribution of Input Data \nWith random ti between 10 seconds and 200 seconds \ninclusive, and random wij between 1 second to 20 seconds \ninclusive, the range of nodes occupied by optimal \ndistribution is analyzed. With 10 different numbers of \navailable nodes for storage, the ranges and execution times \nof optimal distributions are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 \nrespectively. Fig. 4 shows that the optimal distributions \nalways occupy all available nodes for storage. It can be \nconcluded that the optimal distribution tends to occupy as \nmany nodes as possible. Fig. 5 shows that the more nodes are nused for storing input data, the less time is taken by the \nexecution of loads. The reason is that by occupying more \nnodes, nodes can get input data locally and less time is \nneeded by data transmission. So in the term of reducing \nprocessing time, the input data should be distributed among \nall nodes participating processing. \n \nFigure 4.  Nodes occupied by optimal data distributions \nThe effects of the computing and communication \ncapabilities of nodes on the distribution of input data are also \nevaluated. In Fig. 6, with the same wij set to 5 seconds and \nrandom ti between 10 seconds and 200 seconds inclusive, the \noptimal distributions are given when the numbers of storage \nnodes are 20, 40 and 100 separately. It is observed that the \nbigger ti is, the fewer data sets are distributed to node i. That \nis to say, the optimal distribution distributes more data sets to \nmore powerful nodes. Especially when m is 100, Si*ti of \nnode Pi is equal to Sj*tj of another node Pj. That implies that \nthere is no data transmission, data sets are distributed in ndirect proportion to nodes’ computing capabilities. So it is \nbetter to store more data sets in nodes with higher computing \ncapabilities. This conclusion is also supported by the data \nplacement scheme proposed by J Xie[10] and data replication \nstrategy DARE[11]. \nIn Fig. 7, with the same ti set to 50 seconds and random nwij between 1 second and 20 seconds inclusive, the optimal \ndistributions are given when numbers of storage nodes are \n20, 40 and 100 separately. Random wij of the same sender \nnode is set to be equal, i.e wi1=wi2=…=win. It is observed \nthat the nodes with the minimum communication time are \ndistributed extremely many data sets. Other nodes are \ndistributed almost the same number of data sets with \ndifferent values of m Due to the concurrent communication \nmodel adopt in this paper, nodes tend to require data from \nnodes with minimum communication time. While other \nnodes only need to store data sets that they will process by nthemselves. \n \nFigure 5.  Execution time of optimal data distributions \n \nFigure 6.  Relationship between nodes’ computing time and optimal data \ndistributions \n \nFigure 7.  Relationship between nodes’ communication time and optimal \ndata distributions \n1268\nB. Scheduling of Loads \nThe effects of the computing and communication \ncapabilities of nodes on the optimal scheduling of loads are \ndiscussed under fixed distribution of input data. To simulate \nthe real situations, the size of data sets on storage nodes is nrandom integer between 80 percent and 120 percent of the \naverage size of data sets for each storage node, S divided by \nm, inclusive. \nWhen m is 10 and wij is 5 seconds for all nodes, three \nrounds of random ti between 10 seconds to 200 seconds \ninclusive are generated and analyzed with same distribution \nof input data. As shown in Fig. 8, slow storage nodes, which \nare nodes need more time to finish processing all stored data nsets, transfer more data sets to other nodes. For the slowest \nnodes, about 96 percent of distributed data sets are exported. \nExperiments are also carried out by only changing m from \n10 to 100 and the result is shown in Fig. 9. It is also observed \nthat slower nodes tend to transfer more stored data sets to \nother nodes. So in MapReduce, input data from slow storage \nnodes should be preferentially scheduled to idle nodes nwithout local input data. \n \nFigure 8.  Relationship between nodes’ computing capability and optimal nscheduling\(m = 10 m 100 inclusive are \ngenerated and analyzed with same distribution of input data. \nRandom wij of the same sender node is set to be equal, i.e. \nwi1=wi2=…=win. The Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 are results when m \nis 10 and 100 respectively. \nIt is observed that different communication time of nodes \naffects the optimal scheduling 


little. Because when the \ncomputing capabilities of nodes are same, the size of data \nsets processed by each node is almost the same, and the left \ndata sets have to be transferred to other nodes without local \ninput data. So under fixed distribution of input data, the \nscheduling does not need to consider much about ncommunication capabilities of nodes. \n \nFigure 10.  Optimal scheduling with different communication time\(m 10 m = 100 analyzes the data distribution and task \nscheduling in MapReduce. A divisible load scheduling \nmodel for describing the data transmission and task \nexecution are proposed with concurrent communication \nmodel. By abstracting the task allocation and corresponding \ndata transmission as scheduling loads from multiple input n1269\nsources, the detailed process of MapReduce is analyzed. The \noptimal distribution of input data and scheduling of loads in \nmap phase are presented with linear programming. By \nevaluating the performance with proposed model, following \ninstructional principles are observed: \n By distributing the input data of MapReduce to as \nmany available nodes as possible, the execution \ntime will be reduced. Because that makes nodes \nparticipating processing have their own local data, \nthe overhead of data transmission is reduced. \n The performance of MapReduce can be improved \nby distributing more input data to relatively \npowerful nodes The powerful nodes process more \ndata in the same period of time, so more input data \nare needed. \n It is wise to schedule tasks whose input data stored \nin a relatively slow node to nodes without local \ninput data A slower node means that the node \nneeds more time to finish processing all input data \nstored by it. \n The communication capability of a node affects the \noptimal scheduling little under fixed input data ndistribution. \nThe experiments in this paper are finite, and many other \nenvironments are not evaluated. By setting parameters more \nsufficiently, new conclusions may be drawn. The reduce \nphase will be discussed more sufficiently in the next step. \nThe concurrent communication model adopted in this paper \nalso limits the scope of applications. So other \ncommunication models will be researched in the future work. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science \nFoundation of China under Grant No. 61212005 and the nFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of \nChina under Grant No. 65012101. \n \nREFERENCES n[1] J.

as they apply\nsequential accessing of modeled segments.\nWe also analyse the number of modeled segments accessed\nby each approach in Fig. 6\(c segments affect\nthe performance. MR works on the entire table, thus, the\nnumber of accessed segments is the same. From the point\nof view of the application, only qualified modeled segments\nare returned for gridding thus FKV processes no redundant\nmodeled segments and consumes the least amount of modeled\nsegments. Since IT scans the SS of one node until encountering\nan unqualified model, the total number of accessed segments\nis a little larger than that of FKV. Our KSM processes larger\nnumber of segments than both IT and FKV due to the\ncontinuous and redundant range of SSs found by isearch+.\nHowever, the results also verify our theoretical analysis that\nthe amount of redundant modeled segments is bounded. MRK\naccesses more segments than IT, FKV and KSM, as it adds\nthe SSs between So and V to form a continuous sub-table\nfor MapReduce. Referring to Fig. 6\(a and Fig. 6\(b efficient.\nFig. 6 \(d e f approaches exhibit\nsimilar patterns as for the time range queries, so we skip the\ndetailed analysis.\n2 Query: The time and value point query processing\nperformance are shown in Fig. 6\(g value point queries. The response time of KSM is a little\ngreater than IT, but outperforms the other approaches, because\nIT is able to access all qualified modeled segments in one SS.\nHowever, the KSM scans the whole SS entries of a node to find\nthe qualified ones. Because of the invocation of MapReduce\nand redundant modeled segments in the sub-table, MRK takes\nmore time than both IT and KSM. But, as MRK does not work\non the entire table as MR does, it takes about 2 x less time\nthan MR. FKV consumes the most time as it needs to wait for\nserver-side full table scan before gridding operations. Since the\nsize of the domain of the sensor data values is smaller than\nthat of the time domain, nodes in value vs-tree accommodate\nmore modeled segments than time vs-tree nodes. Thus, the\nresponse times of value point queries of IT, FKV and KSM\napproaches are all more than those of time point queries. For\nMR and MRK, the processing time differences between time\nand value queries are insignificant, as the time spent on model\nfiltering and gridding is not dominant.\nD. Insights into KVI-Scan-MapReduce\nThis experiment aims to reveal how much time KSM spends\non model gridding, which is an additional step, as compared\nto querying raw sensor data. Due to space constraints, we only\nshow the results from time range queries of selectivity from\n10% to 50%. From Fig. 6\(h for 1/3 - 1/2 of the total processing time. As the\nmajority of the gridding work is performed in the reduce phase\nand the amount of qualified segments for reducers depends\non the query selectivity, the time spent on model gridding\nincreases with the query selectivity. If the model gridding can\nadapt to users' different requirements for query results, the\nperformance of KSM can be further improved.\n289\nFig. 6. Query performance a c d g g h constitution\nVII. CONCLUSION\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\nexplore the key-value representation of an interval index for\nmodel-view based sensor data management. Different from\nconventional external-memory index structure with complex\nnode merging and split mechanisms, our KVI-index resident\npartially in memory and partially materialized in the key-value\nstore, is easy to maintain in the dynamic sensor data generation\nenvironment. Moreover, we proposed a hybrid query pro-\ncessing approach, namely KVI-Scan-MapReduce, integrating\nthe KVI-index, range scan and MapReduce for model-view\nsensor data in key-value stores. Extensive experiments in a\nreal testbed showed that our approach outperforms in terms\nof query response time and index updating efficiency not only\nquery processing methods based on raw sensor data but also\nall other approaches considered based on model-view sensor\ndata for time/value range and point queries. As a future work,\nwe plan to explore how to process time and value composite\nqueries based on KVI-index.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. Sathe, T. G. Papaioannou, H. Jcung, and K.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
