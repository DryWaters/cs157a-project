constraint as this methodology provides direct modelling of data distribution in the data space Hence clustering-based partitioning of data space usually requires lesser number of prototypes rule nodes However systems based on clustering-based prototyping usually have opaque computing structure For example the input fuzzy sets derived by SAFIS have large overlaps that obstruct the understandings of the underlying data structure refer to  The other benchmark systems employ complex operations and perform ne tuning of network parameters The proposed eFE model does not require such time consuming complex operations For example RANEKF and MRAN networks are evolving radial basis neural networks based on the principle of the Resource Allocation Network RAN RANEKF e xtends the RAN by emplo ying the Extended Kalman Filter EKF algorithm in place of the Least Mean Squares LMS algorithm MRAN extends RAN and RANEKF by combining the growth criterion of the RAN with a pruning strategy based on the relative contribution of each hidden unit to the overall network output SAFIS computes the statistical contribution of every rule to the system output and the parameters are tuned with EKF algorithm eTS has to recursively update its TSK model structure based on the potential of the input data This is de“ned based on its distances to all other data points that have been received As for the DENFIS online model a weighted recursive Least-Square Estimator LSE is used In SONFIN the consequent parameters of its TSK rules are tuned either by LMS or Recursive Least Squares RLS algorithms and the precondition parameters are tuned by back-propagation algorithm FALCON-ART tunes the parameters of the MFs using the back-propagation algorithm Unconstraint accuracy-oriented parameter optimization is also one of the other reasons that will produce signi“cant overlapping of the fuzzy MFs This obstructs the understandings of the underlying data structure  The training and testing data are generated from the same difference equation 16 An accuracy-oriented modelling technique with enough training cycles to tune its network structure and parameters would de“nitely perform better in this case On the other hand the eFE learning algorithm does not try to reduce the error to zero Under soft computing paradigm the proposed eFE aims to contain the error between the computed output and desirable values within an acceptable threshold Hence the learning error is not asymptotically reduced to zero It is seldom the case in reality that the unseen events replicate exactly the same as past events Hence optimization done at the present time instance has no guarantee in providing an optimal solution that will also generalize well for future unseen events For one obvious reason current optimization may produce a solution that over ts to the current set of training data Section IV-B illustrates this point by evaluating EFuNN DENFIS and eFE to track a TABLE I F ORECAST R ESULTS ON O NLINE N ONLINEAR S YSTEM I DENTIFICATION  Reasoning Model Type  Rules Testing RMSE MRAN a NN 10 0.0129 RANEKF a NN 11 0.0184 SONFIN a TSK 10 0.0130 SAFIS a TSK 8 0.0116 Simpl eTS a  r 0.075   10 6  TSK 18 0.0122 eTS a  r 1.0   10 6  TSK 19 0.0082 DENFIS TSK 8 0.0482 FALCON-ART M 289 0.1379 EFuNN M 18 0.0578 eFE E-M 21 0.0751 a  Result adapted from NN  Neural Netw ork TSK  T akagi-Sugeno-Kangbased fuzzy model M  Mamdani-based fuzzy model E-M  Extended Mamdanibased fuzzy model that handles mutual inclusivity    Number of hidden nodes RMSE  Root Mean Squared Error   0 200 900 1100 1900 2100 2 1 0 1 2 3          Time Instance t y\(t+1 Disturbance introduced t1 Disturbance removed t2 actual  EFuNN  DENFIS eFE Fig 3 Forecast of time-varying nonlinear system time-varying nonlinear system B Online System Identi“cation of a Time-Varying Nonlinear System The previous nonlinear dynamic system 16 is modi“ed as shown in 17 y d  t 1 y d  t  1 y 2 d  t   u 3  t  f  t   17 where f  t  simulates the disturbance to be introduced and is de“ned in 18 f  t   0  0  t  1000 and t  2001 1  1001  t  2000 18 Similar to the eFE model is emplo yed to progressi v ely identify the characteristics of the modi“ed nonlinear dynamic system Figure 3 shows the tracking capability of eFE EFuNN and DENFIS The eFE model is able to track the underlying system characteristics right from the initial stage The proposed eFE model is also able to track new system characteristics when the disturbance f  t  is introduced at time t1  t  1001  and when it is removed at time t2  t  2001  EFuNN has large tracking error towards the end of the simulation DENFIS exhibits large tracking error at time t2 Figure 4\(a illustrates the corresponding changes to the structure of the three models For eFE rule nodes are progres2673

disturbance is removed at t2 the fuzzy rules that describe the disturbance are subsequently removed This is because these rules are not activated frequently enough to make it relevant for the present data events For EFuNN rule nodes are progressively added even when disturbance has been removed at t2 The structure of DENFIS is xed after the introduction of disturbance at time t1 Figure 4\(b illustrates the accumulated squared error computed over 100 adjacent time steps Spikes in the eFE learning error are observed at three instances namely during the initial stage at time t 0  when the disturbance is introduced at time t1 and when the disturbance is removed at t2 The increase in learning error at these three instances corresponds to the time when there are changes in the underlying properties of the nonlinear system model When the disturbance f  t  is removed at t2 only a smaller increase in eFE learning error has been observed In contrast EFuNN performs unacceptably The online learning error of EFuNN generally becomes larger at each time instance On the other hand DENFIS has overly learnt and tted the data This is because the online learning error accumulated by DENFIS just after the disturbance was removed is higher than the amount of error accumulated when the disturbance was introduced The information learnt by DENFIS before the disturbance was introduced is lost even though the number of rules has not reduced This experiment illustrates that DENFIS accuracy-oriented optimization on the given information causes the network to quickly skew towards current information and forget the information learnt in the past Figure 5 plots the distribution of the last 1000 input data samples and the centroids of the rules identi“ed by eFE The gure shows more rules are identi“ed near the lower left and upper right region of the input data space These regions correspond to the input data samples that are more closely located The lower level eFE rules coarsely describe these regions and higher level rules are added to describe these regions in ner detail V C ONCLUSION This paper presents an online learning-based hierarchical NFS called eFE evolving Fuzzy Ensemble A progressive learning algorithm is proposed to incrementally modify the hierarchical structure of eFE in accordance with neurophysiological studies With continuous exposure to external stimuli the eFE network adapts its structure by allocating nodes and creating links to autonomously support fuzzy data associations Activity-dependent synapse with global decay learning rule is incorporated such that fuzzy rules that are relevant to the observed training data are reinforced while rules that are inconsistent are weakened This technique simulates the two opposite mechanisms that are involved in memory persistence  33 28 At the same time the eFE netw ork structure is simpli“ed by removing similar and irrelevant fuzzy knowledge This is accomplished by removing rules that have similar forecast output and irrelevant rules that are no longer reinforced by the external stimuli This technique corresponds to structure plasticity related to the removal of neurons and synapses that contributes to the loss of memory see e.g for instance The learning algorithm employed by eFE possesses the distinguishing features of online learning algorithms as outlined in Sect I The experimental results are concluded as follows  The experimental result showed that the proposed eFE model is able to adequately model the underlying data characteristics of a nonlinear system compared to other benchmarked modelling techniques  The tracking capability of eFE model was demonstrated by learning the underlying data characteristics of a timevarying system Without prior knowledge of the data distribution the eFE multi-resolution hierarchy structure allows both good generalization and ne detail to be captured Unlike other benchmark modelling techniques the experiment also showed the capability of the proposed eFE in removing irrelevant fuzzy knowledge The experiment also demonstrated that optimization can cause a model to quickly skew towards current information and forget the information learnt in the past In conclusion most batch learning methodologies are computationally intensive with the objective of deriving a global 2674 


solution by optimizing certain criterion e.g parameter adaptation to minimize prediction error under supervised learning The extension of of”ine learning paradigms to online learning mode questions the need for such intensive computation given that only limited information is available at a given time After all such form of limited-knowledge optimization in time-varying environment would likely not produce a globally optimized solution which directly contradicts the initial idea for optimization in a global sense Instead this paper presents a simple fuzzy associative learning algorithm that does not rely on computationally intensive accuracy-oriented optimization to incrementally adapt an ensemble of fuzzy models R EFERENCES  L A Zadeh Fuzzy logic Neural netw orks and Soft Computing

the downside of this is that the set <TID, {Xk}> that would have been generated at each pass may be huge.  Another algorithm, called AprioriHybrid, is introduced in [3].  The basic idea of the AprioriHybird algorithm is to run the Apriori algorithm initially, and then switch to the AprioriTid algorithm when the generated database \(i.e. <TID, {Xk would fit in the memory The AprioriTid algorithm does not use the database for counting support after the first pass.  Instead, a set containing those transaction ids with their potentially large itemsets is used in the next passes. At each pass other than the first pass the scanning of the entire database is avoided.  We have implemented the AprioriTid algorithm by using C++, and on a 2.4 GHz machine, with 4 GB of RAM and running windows Vista. The data set used was obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics \(NCHS Control and Prevention \(CDC http://www.cdc.gov/nchswww/nchshome.htm system Interface is given in Figure 3   Figure 3: System Interface V. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In the process of experimental results, we have tested several values for minimum support and minimum confidence By checking the output results and looking for non-trivial rules by experts, we found it is suitable to show only those experiments with a minimum support value of 1%, and minimum confidence equals to 70%.  In order to have a clear view of the system findings, we choose to limit the length of the generated frequent itemsets to 3. In Figure 3, the system interface accepts four inputs  Input file: the data should be in a binary format Output file: either frequent itemsets or frequent association rules Minimum Support as a percentage and Minimum Confidence: as a percentage  There are two output modes, the first is frequent item sets mode, and the other is the frequent association rule mode. In Table 1, we give a sample of the frequent association rules

Also, there is a strong dependency between mothers being smoking or not during pregnancy and the mental health of her kids.  By going through most of the generated rules, we could find that the results are consistent with the latest medical research findings. In addition to that we have found that some of the rules are completely nontrivial, such as that rule that states that there is  a relationship between not having dogs or cats in household and the effect on the kid  being shy when meeting friends VI. CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have discussed the problem of the high volume of medical data to be read by physicians, the accuracy rate that tends to decrease, and automatic reading of data that becomes highly desirable. Various association mining techniques have been considered.  Of those techniques, we have chosen AprioriTid algorithm as the basic association mining technique. It is been implemented as the core of our medical mining system. The system has been implemented and used against the data of the National Center for Health Statistics \(NCHS Prevention \(CDC disseminated and analyzed on the health status of U.S citizens. The outcomes of collection and analyses are made available through different data release mechanisms including 


CD-ROMs \(Search and Retrieval Software, Statistical Export and Tabulation System \(SETS files, publications, and through the national center for health statistics \(NCHS http://www.cdc.gov/nchswww/nchshome.htm our experiments on a 2.4 GHz machine, with 4 GB of RAM and running windows Vista. In our experimental phase, we have used a minimum support value of 1%, and minimum confidence equals to 70%. From the generated association rules that we have found some interesting rules that can be used in the early prediction of health problems ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors wish to thank the research center in the college of computer and information science, King Saud University for funding this work REFERENCES 1] N.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
