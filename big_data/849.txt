NTRODUCTION  NASA and other space agencies ha ve identified the need to improve the processing and data storage capabilities onboard space systems to support the complexity of future missions  Increased am ount s of col l ect ed dat a coupl ed with limited downlink speeds makes the need to process and store data on-orbit critical The US Air Force also recognizes the coming \223data crunch\224 and sees increasing spacecraft processing performance and data storage capacity as vital to the success of future missions [3 To meet high performance, hi gh storage memory capacity mission requirements, system designers often turn to Commercial Off The Shelf \(COTS\memory components to 
provide cost-effective, high-density storage solutions for a wide variety of space appli cations including Solid State Recorders \(SSRs SEAKR Engineering has used a large number of COTS Dynamic Random Access Memory DRAM\ponents in order to utilize the high density and low power consumption provided by this technology.

The use of these co mponents in space applications 
req u i res th at th eir su scep tib ility to rad i atio n  effects in  b o t h  near earth and interplanetary environments be well understood.  While densities up to 2  Gb are now available lower density parts have been in orbit long enough to gather statistically significant data.  This report examines 64 Mb 128 Mb, and 256 Mb DRAM upset rates and compares them to predictions made using CREME96.  Upon evaluation of actual space weather data the models are shown to be slightly conservative The data used to compare th e observed upset rates to the predicted rates is derived from Heavy Ion \(HI\ngle Event Upset \(SEU\tests and proton SEU tests.  CREME96 is used to generate predictions from the SEU test data for on-orbit 
upset rates and th  t ool  i s  used for est i m at i ng total dose.  Data sets were taken by SEAKR Engineering The Aerospace Corporation [6 and Innovative Concepts Incorporated [7].  The th ree groups utilized different techniques for defining error events as single bit upsets versus Single Event Functional Interrupts \(SEFIs\No attempt has been made to normalize these error event definitions 2  S PACE W EATHER  Space weather, in the context of this report, is defined as the radiation received by a space system in its unique orbit including nominal background radiation and radiation contributions from Solar Particle Events \(SPEs\produced 
during exceptionally energetic solar flares or solar coronal mass ejections The nominal background radiation consists of Galactic Cosmic Ray \(GCR\ ions and protons which are produced during stellar formation and evolution.  These particles are present throughout the universe in various quantities and densities.  The Earth\222s location in our local solar system, and thus the nominal radiation background for most man-made space systems, can be described as located in a uniform density of GCR heavy ions and protons.  Other locations in interplanetary space within the solar system may have slightly differe nt quantities of background particles relative to the distance from our local sun 


  2 However, for the purposes of th is report, current models can be used to predict the background flux for distances of up to 1.5 Astronomical Units \(AUs\he average Mars-Sun radial distance, which includes all space systems documented in this report.  The Earth\222s magnetosphere affects the quantity and energy of the particles r eceived at the location of each space system that orbits Earth particularly as the orbits of the space systems intersect areas of protons trapped by the Earth\222s magnetosphere.  Orbits which range in altitude from about 500 km to 13,000 km are populated with high energy protons and regions such as the South Atlantic Anomaly SAA\are very densely populated. These populations of trapped protons are a major cause of errors in microelectronics in Low Earth Orbit \(LEO\and Mid Earth Orbit \(MEO\s due to ionizing ra diation, longterm dose build-up and degradation due to displacement damage in the lattice structures of silicon integrated circuits These trapped proton contributions to the nominal background radiation must be included when modeling the expected radiation envir onment for a space system As the Sun progresses through its solar cycle it reverses its magnetic field every 11 years re sulting in a 22 year cycle During this cycle, as the magnetic field lines begin to shift sunspots will begin to form, increasing until the sun is in the middle of a magnetic pole shift.  During the increased disturbance of the magnetic field, unpredictable solar particle events \(SPEs ndomly occur.  These events associated with the changing ma gnetic field, typically affect the earth by irradiating it with greater than an order of magnitude more flux for a short period of time than the flux received from the nominal sp ace radiation background Solar particle events which impact the Earth\222s magnetosphere in a significant way are loosely separated into two broad categories:  solar flares and solar coronal mass ejections \(CMEs ents tend to track the solar cycle via sunspot occurrence Figure 1   with events occurring more frequently proportional to increases in the frequency and density of sunspots Solar flares typically do not produce significant solar particle events but they do affect the solar wind and the magnetosphere of the Earth leading to a \223stormy\224 magnetosphere.  The exact mechanism which triggers a solar coronal mass ejection is not well understood but the bombardment of high energy protons and electrons causes a large impact on space systems as well as sensitive terrestrial electronics.  A thorough space physics foundation detailing the Sun-Earth interactions, is beyond the scope of this report, but there are numerous references available in the Solar Physics and Astrophysical Journals. During a typical space system's mission a range of several small to large SPEs will likely occur.  These events can be compared with a large magnitude event that took pl ace during late October 1989 which is referred to as the prototypical worst case SPE Although occurring infrequently, SPEs, must be expected and accounted for in any space mission Typical mission requirements indicate that a device must operate for a certain period of time without an upset.  The requirements also may i ndicate the space radiation environments and models that must be used for calculating upset rates in those envir onments.  The required space radiation environment nomina lly consists of trapped protons, GCR heavy ions and protons and some estimated number of worst-case SPE days.  This ionizing radiation environment will be for a specific orbit and specific mission duration.  Meeting the design requirements for a particular mission is often challenging given that customer imposed radiation environment requirements often produce a conservative upset-rate estimate for number of errors produced by ionizing radiation during a mission.  The two radiation environments which make the largest contribution to the total daily amount of radiation induced upsets to a space system are typically the trapped protons, from orbits which intercept the SAA, and the number of estimated SPE days which can occur during a mission.  An overly conservative estimate may resu lt in decreased performance due to increased error-mitigation overhead and increased or additional costs due to the inclusion of radiation hardened components for circuits.  A thorough understanding of the proposed space environment based on the mission, from launch to termination, will provide a more realistic upset rate probability and reduce the overly conservative environmental predictions, thus reducing overall cost especially for programs that allow for increased risks The actual worst-case space weather is found to be many times less harmful than predicted for most missions Summing the CMEs and solar flare activity since 2002 through the time of publication \(time span of missions evaluated for this report\, only 1.4 worst case SPEs have  Not e t h at t h i s t i m e peri od cont ai ns a transition from Solar Maximum to Solar Minimum Observations of CMEs produced by the Sun over the last 30 years and collected by GOES space systems in geostationary orbits indicate that on-average only 2.8 worstcase days occur during any 10 year mission.  For shorter missions which launch just after a solar maximum, the number of expected worst-case days can be expected to be even less.  However, mission requirements often state that the environment shall consist of between one and seven worst case SPE days 1989 October Event per year which leads to very conservative upset rate predictions.  One worst case day per year more than doubles the daily possibility for an upset.  Thus most devices flown in space have large factors of conservancy built into their upset rate predictions compared to the actual ionizing radiation environment that they will likely experience Accurate prediction of space weather is challenging but necessary for the calculation of precise radiation environment contributions to device and system upset rates

CME data used in reconstruction of the observed space weather for our dataset has been cro ss calibrated with data from the SOHO spacecraft [10 3  C OMPONENT TECHNOLOGY AND R ADIATION E FFECTS D ATA  Numerous types of memory technologies exist offering a variety of benefits and drawbacks and can be used to fulfill specific roles in space missions Flash technology offers non-volatility, excellent densitie s and power dissipation but is limited in terms of end life features such as having a limited number of writes and total ionizing dose radiation susceptibility.  Therefore, flas h is typically used for long term storage of critical system configuration data that is used infrequently such as operating system code and programmable logic device configurations in missions such as on the Air Force Radiation Laboratory TacSat-3 ARTEMIS hyper-spectral imaging system W h en required, such critical data is loaded from flash into volatile memory for use, allowing the flash to typically remain unpowered and thus extend its useful life expectancy Though not the typical case, SEAKR has built large-scale solid-state recorders using flash memory when the mission duration was sufficiently short such that the end of life effects were tolerabl Si nce fl ash t echnol ogy i s  not  typically used as the basis for long duration and large capacity SSRs, the technology is not the focus of this report Volatile memory provides advantages over flash in terms of reduced access latency and extended device life spans but at the cost of power and data vol atility.  Two technologies that are most often used in space payloads are Static Random Access Memory \(SRAM\ic Random Access Memory \(DRAM\.  A summary of differences between these technologies is that DRAM provides for greater density components and is typically less expensive per bit while SRAM exhibits improved performance with reduced data access latency, but typica lly requires higher power per bit. DRAM is typically preferred when density is the primary consideration \(i.e when size and weight are important\AM is preferred when reducing data access latency is the primary concern.  The advent of Synchronous DRAM \(SDRAM\mproved the performance of DRAM, but has increased device access complexity.  For example, SDRAM was used on a SEAKR SSR with 2 Tb capacity deployed on commercial imaging space system because the syst em is required to capture compress and downlink data at rates up to   Since DRAM is typically used for high-performance, high 


  4 capacity SSRs, the data for th e programs featured in this report exclusively focus on DRAM technology.  Poivey et al com p are on-orbi t upset rat e s from  a wi de vari et y  of SSRs that utilized primarily SRAM and some lower density DRAM technologies than presented in this report as shown in Table 1 This report presents the corrected single-bit upset rate results from several SSRs utilizing higher density DRAM. A total of 507 Gb of storage capacity was used in this analysis and represents a statistically significant sample of number of devices and device hours in orbit Discussion of DRAM components presented in this report The following three DRAM com ponents will be discussed Samsung 64 Mb, Samsung 128 Mb, and Hitachi 256 Mb The Samsung 64 Mb KM44V16004 is Fast Page Mode CMOS DRAM.  Fast Page Mode offers high speed random access of memory cells within the same row.  Revisions A B, and D of this part are used in the analyzed systems as shown in Table 2 All of these parts have a 0.28 m feature si R a di at i on effect s dat a on t h e Sam s ung KM44V16004 measured by SEAKR and is also available in the comparison provided in There i s no det a i l e d explanation of the test method presented in the report  however the results are categor ized into SEU during a read function and SEFI modes which require a power cycle.  The data from experiments conducted with 64 Mb parts shows a limited number of SEFI-like events, the majority of upsets being single bit errors The Samsung 128 Mb KM44S32030 is a synchronous high data rate DRAM organized as 4 x 8,388,608 words by 4 bits, fabricated with Samsung\222s CMOS technology. The programs discussed in this report have utilized revisions A and B of this component.  This part has a 0.35 m minimum feature si R a di at i on effect s dat a on t h i s com ponent  was measured by SEAKR and compares favorably to the data in [7 ICI used a proprietary test system that was capable of running both static and dynamic tests.  The dynamic tests ran at an operating speed of 66 MHz with 16 s refresh rate using 64 Mb out of the 128 Mb of memory.  The static tests wrote and read only 16 kb of the memory.  ICI examined the data for multiple bit upsets \(MBUs\g between 1 and 7%.  Only two SEFI-like events are reported The error types observed in the 128 Mb part, which has a larger feature size, appear to be comparable to those observed in the 64 Mb components.  The increase in the relative number of SEFI events as the density increases could be due to either the smaller feature size \(and hence smaller volume\r to the relatively larger areal density of control logic to cell area The Hitachi HM5225405B is a 256-Mbit SDRAM organized as 16777216-words by 4-bits by  4 banks. This component has a 160 nm minimum feature size. The Hitachi HM5225405 256 Mb radiation effects data was measured by SEAKR and has been used in analysis presented in this report Table 1.

For this analysis we chose to use \223worst day\224 events because they correlated well to a per-day error rate and the available solar data.  During solar events the magnetosphere is typically disturbed so the \223stormy\224 condition is included in the simulation.  As with the GCR proton results these predictions are only applicable to hydrogen  5  Solar energetic particle heavy ion predictions are identical to the SEP pr otons except that they apply to elements 2 through 92  Analytical Function Fitting Method The error cross-section of the data presented in this report was plotted with Poisson error bars and fit with Weibull curves.  A proprietary SEAKR MATLAB 256 routine was utilized to solve for the best curve fit using several statistical metrics.  The Weibull curve is defined by four parameters: saturated cross sec tion, Linear Energy Transfer LET\threshold, the Weibull shape parameters Width and Exponent. These parameters are used by the Heavy ion Upset \(HUP\on Upset \(PUP\modules in CREME96 Orbit Calculation The SPENVIS tool was used to calculate both the amount of time the spacecraft spends in the South Atlantic Anomaly and also the Total Ionizing Dose \(TID during the mission.  The orbital generator tool uses temporal information, the altitude, and the inclination to create a data file detailing the orbit of the mission.  This file can then be plotted; examples of a daily orbit tracks are shown in Figures 2 and 3 A comparison of various Sensitive Volumes \(SVs\n Poivey et al  reveal ed that while there was a conn ection between SV and heavy ion related upset rates, the mission upset rates were typically dominated by the SAA proton-dense trapped proton environment.  The SV was varied over a range between 0.25 m and 7 m and never represented more than 23% of the total mission upset count for orbits which included the SAA.  For space sy stems outside of the Earth\222s protective magnetosphere the contribution of sensitive volume could vary the predicted upset rate by more than 200% since there are no trapped protons.  A conservative SV of 0.5 \265m was used for all memories in this analysis 


  6 Environmental Methodology The on-orbit averaged trapped proton models in the CREME96 application take into account all trapped protons for a particular orbit, including not only the low-density of protons trapped by the Earth\222s magnetosphere, but also those trapped in proton-dense regions such as the SAA These orbit-averaged trapped protons contribute continuously to the upset rate of the memory and are thus weighted at 100% when used to calculate the daily bit-upset rates.  The other results from the HUP and PUP modules which need to be weighted are the solar event particles versus the galactic particles.  The actual worst-case SPE space weather covering all of the missions was obtained from National Geophysical Data Center \(NGDC National Oceanic Atmospheri c Administration \(NOAA The weighting values used fo r each radiation environment for each space system is different, and the values used in the analyses are shown Table 3   Figure 2. Plotted above is the influence of trapped protons along the Program III Orbit showing the space system\222s typical da ily path, which clearly transits the proton-dense SAA \(colored squares several times daily Plot generated with SPENVIS  Figure 3. Trapped protons along the orbit of Program I showing multiple transits of the SAA \(colored squares Plot generated with SPENVIS  Total Ionizing Dose Calculation Once the trajectory files are cr eated, the total ionizing dose for each orbit can be calculated using another SPENVIS model, SHIELDOSE-2.  SHIELDOSE-2 is based upon Monte Carlo calculations of electron and proton interactions with aluminum.   It takes into account various detector materials and accounts for transport through the spacecraft wall [5 Figure 4 shows the effect calculated for various thicknesses In order to compare the relationship between TID and SEU rates for various missions we examined these radiation phenomena as a function of the actual radiation environment for each mission Figure 5 shows the actual corrected errors for a space syst em in a polar orbit at an altitude of 830 km.  The predicted total dose accumulated at a rate of 1.26 krad [Si per y ear and has been scaled linearly and overlaid on the plot \(purple line\Also overlaid are the scaled sunspot cycle \(NGDC data   showing a decrease towards a solar minimum, and the scaled coronal mass ejection contribution \(NOAA  and SOHO [10  data\th the corresponding scaled CREME96 worst case day \(October 1989 event\.  There appears to be two potential contributions to the increased upset rate of the device.  The first potential contribution is the increase of accumulated dose on the device which may cause an increase in device susceptib ility.  The second potential contribution is a little more complex.  As the solar cycle approaches a solar minimum, the Earth\222s magnetosphere becomes less \223stormy\224 and thus more exposed to external GCR protons and heavy ions which allows more potential for an SEU to occur.  There does not appear to be a noticeable contribution from CMEs to the limited upset rate data 5  R ESULTS  On-orbit upset data from 3853 COTS DRAM components with 64, 128, and 256 Mb densities that provide 507 Gb of storage capacity and represent 1.8E8 on-orbit DRAM device hours in SEAKR built and designed SSRs has been presented in this report. When the mission orbits are run through CREME96 and weighted using the observed space weather for their mission duration to date, upset predictions are shown to be up to 10 times more conservative than observed upsets. Analysis has been performed to help determine possible attribution for the significant difference between the observed and predicted numbers of upsets Table 4 summarizes the orbit, shielding, and durations of the missions used.  These results demonstrate that the models used in CREME96 coupled with conservative Weibull fits to accelerator da ta may lead to conservative upset rate prediction.  It is worth noting that in the last decade, we have only experien ced 4.9 CME induced \223worst days\224. This analysis may be useful to those who are 


  7 responsible for providing mission specifications for the ionizing radiation environment It is also worth noting that none of the missions analyzed here have experienced any unc orrectable DRAM errors This observation implies that th ere are no destructive effects such as SEL which have been observed in any of the DRAM components in 1.8E8 device hours on-orbit   Table 3.

Sensitive volume for earth orbiting spacecraft which transit thr ough the Van Allen belts is negligible compared to trapped protons. Most of the data presented used 150 mil shielding as indicated in Table 4  When other thicknesses, ranging from 150 mils to 400 mils were explored as shown in Table 5 less than a 17% change was observed in the predicted upset rate.  A minor difference between the observed and the predicted number of upsets for the majority of the programs analyzed indicates that the models are relatively accurate in predicting upset rates even after the SV and shielding assumptions were explored.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
