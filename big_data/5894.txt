of P 1 to P 2 is set to be 9 to 2 given the importance of P 1 based on Scenario 4 Moreover the ratio of P 7 to P 8 is set to be 8 to 3 given the importance of P 7 based on Scenario 1 The rest of the weights are assigned according to the above scenarios Table IV illustrates the results Column D i represents the ratio values speci\014ed by the user according to the scenarios Both the ordinal and cardinal consistency as explained in Section B for this prioritization are calculated Ordinal consistency is checked by pairs  I i  D i  It is seen that the two corresponding columns all have the same magnitude Thus ordinal consistency is achieved Then cardinal consistency is checked using Equation 7 and the result is 0  933 which is acceptable The last column shows the priority vector of the 12 properties Since the weights for P 2  P 3  P 5  P 6  P 8  and P 10 are very small we will not include them for further calculation Thus only the properties P 1  P 4  P 7  P 9  P 11  and P 12 are considered and using Equation 8 their corresponding weights are adjusted P 12 i 1 V i  0  798 As a result AW  P 1   0  171 AW  P 4   0  099 AW  P 7   0  147 AW  P 9   0  217 AW  P 11   0  092 and AW  P 12   0  274 Under the seven selected properties with their adjusted weights the objective measures are examined with the aim to choose the most appropriate one as illustrated in Table V The rows represent the candidate measures while the columns represent the selected properties For instance the composite weight for Support is computed as follows CW  Support   0  463 As shown in Table V the measure P iatetsky 000 Shapiro  which is of the highest composite weight is chosen B Case two This case is presented aiming at explaining occurrence of inconsistency in the user's property importance speci\014cation Taking the following scenarios into account the user is asked to rank the properties Scenario 1  Accidental rules have no interestingness value TABLE VI Inconsistent property

W 12 W 1 7  9  0  778 0  022 Scenario 2  Since novelty is an important property association rules with less frequent items in the antecedent and consequent are considered more interesting Scenario 3  The size of the database may enlarge over time Interestingness of a rule should be invariant to this change Scenario 4  Interestingness criteria may change over time thus interestingness threshold should easily change considering new criteria Scenario 5  Interestingness value changes upon row or column permutations Scenario 6  Interestingness value stays the same upon both row and column permutation Considering the ratios provided by the user in Table VI for i  1  2  3  5  6  8  10 and 11 one 014nds that the magnitude of I i di\013ers from the one of the corresponding D i  Thus the ordinal consistency is violated Moreover the value of cardinal consistency is calculated using Equation 7 with a value of 35  56 which is not acceptable As a result the ranking is cardinally inconsistent too This inconsistency has occurred due to violating the transitivity in is greater than relation 1 in the user's property preferences The speci\014cations state that P 6 is more preferred than P 7  P 7 is more preferred than P 5  and P 5 is more important than P 6  which contradicts the transitivity in the user's preferences Consequently the user is asked to reevaluate the properties for their importance values It should be noted that this process may need to repeat several times until both types of consistency are passed We show one set of consistent speci\014cations on the twelve properties in Table VII Given the same magnitudes of all the pairs  I i  D i  the ordinal consistency is met In addition the cardinal consistency which is equal to 0  957 according to Equation 7 is obtained Column V i shows the priority of the properties Only P 1  P 2  P 3  P 5  P 6  P 8  P 10  and P 11 are taken into account in this case Since the weights for P 4  P 7  P 9 and P 12 are very small they are neglected for further considerations The adjusted weights of the other properties are computed as follows P 12 i 1 V i  0  822 AW  P 1   0  196 1 A relation  is called transitive if for P  Q  and R  P  Q and Q  R  then P  R  otherwise it is intransitive

approach to assess interestingness measures for association rules Our approach is independent to the number of association rules and assesses the measures based on a set of user's requirements We attribute this to the analytic hierarchical process AHP Some initial case studies are presented to show the e\013ectiveness of our approach It is also noted that none of the measure assessment methods so far deals with the dynamic behavior of the user's requirements In other words these methods must be reapplied in case of changes in the user's behavior In our future work we will attempt to dynamically evaluate association rules according to a collective e\013ect of multiple measures while taking the user's requirements and feedbacks into consideration Acknowledgment The work reported is

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
