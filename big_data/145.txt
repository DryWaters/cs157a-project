The proposed algorithm integrates the fuzzy set concepts and the apriori mining algorithm to find interesting fuzzy association rules from given transaction data Experiments on student grades in I-Shou University are also made to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm 1 Introduction In data mining researches inducing association rules from transaction data is the most commonly seen Most of the previous research works can however only handle transaction data with attributes of binary values In real-world applications transaction data are usually composed of quantitative values Designing a sophisticated data-mining algorithm to deal with different types of 
data turns a challenge in this research topic Recently fuzzy set theory is more and more frequently used in intelligent systems because of its simplicity and similarity to human reasoning 8 The theory has been successfully applied to many fields such as manufacturing engineering diagnosis economics and others 5 8 9 111 This paper integrates the fuzzy-set concepts and the apriori mining algorithm to find interesting itemsets and fuzzy association rules from transaction data with quantitative values A fuzzy data mining algorithm is proposed which is specially capable of transforming quantitative values 
in transactions into linguistic terms then filtering them and finding association rules by modifying the apriori mining algorithm 4  2 Review of Agrawal et al's data mining As mentioned above the goal of data mining is to discover the important associations among items such that the presence of some items in a transaction will imply the presence of some other items For achieving this purpose Agrawal and his co-workers proposed several mining algorithms based on the concept of large itemsets to find association rules from transactions l 
2 3 41 They decomposed the mining process into two phases In the first phase candidate itemsets are generated and counted by algorithms scanning the transactions If the number of an itemset appearing in the transactions is larger than a pre defined threshold value called minimum support the itemset is thought of as a large itemset Itemsets with only one item are first processed The large itemsets with one item are then combined to form candidate itemsets of two items This process is repeated until all large itemsets are found In the second phase the desired association rules 
are induced from the large itemsets found in the first phase All the possible combination ways of association rules for each large itemset are formed and the ones with their calculated confidence values larger than a predefined threshold called minimum confidence\are output as desired association rules In addition to proposing methods for mining association rules from transactions of binary values Agrawal et a1 also proposed a method lo to mine association rules from those with quantitative and categorical attributes. Their proposed method first determines the number of partitions for each quantitative attribute and then 
maps all possible values of each attribute into a set of consecutive integers It then finds the large itemsets whose support values are greater than the user-specified minimum support These large itemsets are then processed to generate association rules and the interesting rules are output from the viewpoint of users In this paper we adopt the fuzzy set concepts to mine associate rules from transactions with quantitative attributes The rules mined out are expressed in linguistic terms which are more natural and understandable for human beings 3 The fuzzy data-mining algorithm for In 
this section the fuzzy concepts are used in the apriori data-mining algorithm to discover useful association rules from quantitative values Notation used in this paper is first stated as follows n the total number of transaction data m the total number of attributes D  the i-th transaction data 1 I i In Aj  th.e j-th attribute 1 Ijl m IAj 1  th.e number 0ff.z.q regions for A  quantitative values 0-7803-5578-4/99/$10.000 1999 IEEE 480

In the future we will attempt to dynamically adjust the membership functions in the proposed mining algorithm to avoid the bottleneck of membership function acquisition We will also attempt to design specific data-mining models for various problem domains References  13 R Agrawal T Imielinksi and A Swami, \223Mining association rules between sets of items in large database,\223 The 1993 ACM SIGMOD Conference Washington DC USA 1993 2 R Agrawal T Imielinksi and A Swami 223Database mining a performance perspective,\224 IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol 5 No 6 1993 pp 914-925 3 R Agrawal R Srikant and Q Vu 223Mining association rules with item constraints,\224 The 7\222hird International Conference on Knowledge Discovery in Databases and Data Mining Newport Beach, California, August 1997 141 R Agrawal and R Srikant, \223Fast algorithm for mining association rules,\224 The International Conference on Very Large Data Bases 1994 pp 487-499 5 I Graham and P L Jones Expert Systems  Knowledge Uncertainty and Decision Chapman and Computing Boston 1988, pp.117-158 6 T P Hong and J B Chen 223Finding relevant attributes and membership functions,\224 Fuzzy Sets and Systems Vol.103 No 3 1999 pp 389404 7 T P Hong and C Y Lee 223Induction of fuzzy rules and membership functions from training examples,\223 Fuzzy Sets and Systems Vol 84 1996 8 A Kandel Fuuy Expert Systems CRC Press Boca Raton 1992 pp 8-19 9 E H Mamdani 223Applications of fuzzy algorithms for control of simple dynamic plants 223 IEEE Proceedings 1974 pp 1585-1588  103 R Srikant and R Agrawal, \223Mining quantitative association rules in large relational tables,\224 The 1996 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data Monreal Canada June ll L A Zadeh 221\221Fuzzy logic,\224 IEEE Computer pp 3347 1996 pp 1-12 1988 pp.83-93 483 


The relations TPP\(X,Y\and NTPP\(X,Y\are indistinguishable in rough sets theory. They together denote inclusion of rough set X in rough set Y In rough set terms, X c Y whenu E Y and R X c k Y The relations TPPI\(X,Y and NTPPI\(X,Y are analogous to TPP\(X,Y and NTPP\(X,Y One may simply exchange the X and Y in the relation and discussion for TPP or NF\222P to get the same results Grouped together these four relations certainly hold for 9 samples and possibly hold for Sample 46 In IO all but five of the pairs may be categorized as having this relationship Partial overlap PO\(X,Y\implies that X and Y are not equal hut that they have some part in common Rough set expression of this relationship involves intersection and equality This relationship will certainly hold whenever n BY  0 and R X n k Y  0 It will possibly bold when X n k Y  0 These results are identical to the 41 samples in IO that meet the requirements for partially overlapping denote that two rough sets intersect at exactly one point, the EC\(X,Y\relationship does not apply It expresses the same relationship as those belonging to the possible region for the PO relationship discussed previously It is evident from the discussion above that rough sets can be used to model relationships for vague regions defined by the RCC method By allowing the expression of belonging to the relationship to be either certain or possible, however, we gain greater insight into the relationship, therefore greater   Because rough set theory does not allow us to specifically called \223immediate conceptual neighbors\224 if 223each can be transformed into the other by a process of gradual, continuous change that does not involve passage through any third relation.\224 The RCCJ relations include DR \(Distinct Regions with no overlap EQ Equal: the regions are the same\PO the regions Partially Overlap\PP \(Proper Part the first region is entirely contained within the second\and PPI Proper Part Inverse: the fust region entirely contains the second\For egg-yolk pairs a yolk is a PP of its own egg The 46 configurations of egg-yolk pairs were then clustered into 13 groups based on RCC-5 relations between complete crispings or relations that are 223mutually crispable\224 see Figure 4 The clusters each relate to one or more additional clusters via a crisping relationship or a subset relationship between a set of complete crispings. Each configuration of a cluster can be crisped to the cluster pointed to by the arrow via one of these relationships knowledge. Rough sets also provide the indiscemibility relation, which aids in quantifying the uncertainty through the approximation regions We now consider another approach for vague regions VI EGG-YOLK APPROACH boundaries we may he inclined to use the Yolk aPProach In this approach concentric subregions make up a vague Figure 3 Clustering ofthe 46 relations IO using RCC-5 relations between complete crispings ofthe configurations Note that no hierarchy or order within the c~ustm is shown here for simplification If we are only concerned ahout the vagueness of region with inner subregions having the property that they are \221crisper\222 than outer subregions. These regions indicate a type of membership in the vague region The simplest case, is that of two subregions In this most corn case the center region is known as the yolk, the outer region surrounding the yolk is known as the white, and the entire region as the egg The yolk and egg comespond to boundary regions ofrough sets. Rough set theory has only these two approximation regions, unlike the possible numerous subregions that make of the indiscemibility relation in rough sets we can vary the partitioning to increase or decrease the level of uncertainty VII ROUGH SET APPROACH TO EGG YOLK CLUSTERING we will now re-examine the cluste\224ng ofegg-yolk pairs this time noting the relationships for each cluster based on mathematical principles from rough sets.

Consider, for example, cluster M This cluster is based on the RCC relations EQ and PPI which means that the regions might be equal or that region X entirely contains region Y In rough sets, this relationship is defmed through the use of the approximation regions The upper approximation region of Y is equal to the lower approximation of X We know certainly then that Y is contained in X It is also possible, however that X and Y are the same \(equal Rough set techniques for information retrieval and data mining in spatial databases and GIS may be applied to models with vague regions expressed by the egg-yolk model and those based on the RCC theory. Rough sets provides a solid mathematical foundation for vague regions that is compatible with other spatial data theories and methods, yet offers an added ability to refine the indiscemibility VIII CONCLUSION Spatial and geographical information systems will continue to play an ever-increasing role in applications based on spatial data Uncertainty management will be necessary for any of these applications and rough sets RCC and egg-yolk methods are appropriate for the representation of vague regions in spatial data Rough sets however, can also model indiscemibility and allow for the change of granularity of the partitioning through its indiscemibility relation Changing the indiscemibility relation has an effect on the boundaries of the vague regions because the lower and upper approximation regions are defined in terms of this indiscemibility. Rough se1 techniques can also be used to define spatial relationships themselves So there is a distinction between combinations that certainly meet the RCC-8 relationship requirements and those that possibly meet the requirements The rough set approach, therefore is very useful in defining vague spatial regions with indeterminate boundaries and in defining spatial relationships holding between vague regions We have also shown how the clustering of egg-yolk pairs by RCC-5 relations can be expressed in terms of operations using rough sets. We believe that rough set techniques can further enhance the egg-yolk approach and are investigating the interrelationships between rough set egg-yolk, RCC and other spatial models We are also investigating the impact of vagueness and uncertainty expressed with these theories on the querying and mining of spatial data allowing a rough set approach to uncertainty in spatial relationships for association rules and other forms of spatial data mining References I R Laurini and D Thompson Fundamentals ofSpotio1 Infomation Systems Academic Press, London, 1992 2 K Kopenki and J Ha\224 224Discovery of Spatial Association Rules in Geographic Information Databases\224 Pmc Sh Int Symp On Large SpatiolDotabmes Panland MN pp. 47-66 1995 3 W Lu J Han and B.

Apriori  M-Apriori DHP BIHP MI HP     E F Figure 5 Comparison of execution times Figure 7 Effect of Till hash table size on the candidates IHP MI HP Figure 6 Effect of multipass partition size in M[HP Figure 8 Effect of Till hash table size on the execution time The effect of the Till hash table size was examined in a series of runs with a minimum support leViel of 2.5% and Till hash table sizes of 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 and 500 entries. Figure 7 shows that there is a sharp reduction in the number of candidate 2-itemsets as the number of Till hash table entries increases up to 250 but only a modest decrease after that In Figure 8 we see that the change in the size of Till hash table, and hence the change in the number of candidate itemsets has little effect upon the total execution time until it becomes as large as 500 entries At this point the effect of candidate pruning clearly offsets the overhead of using the Till hash tables The above results suggest that the MI HP algorithm is more effective than Apriori DHP, M-Apriori and IHP algorithms for mining frequent itemsets from text documents. The next tests were conducted to e'i'aluate how well MI HP scaled in terms of the number of documents to be processed and the number of frequent itemsets mined There were four document collections used for the scalability test a two-week collection \(from 3/2/1992 to 3/13/1992 of 1,739 documents; a one-month collection \(April 1990\of 3,568 documents; a two-mC collection \(September and October of 1991\of 7,361 documents; and the largest collection was for three months \(January, February, and March in 1992\containing 10,163 documents The minimum support level was 1.75% for all test runs In Figure 9 we see that the time per frequent itemset mined increases proportionally with the number of documents in the collection. This suggests that MI HP will scale linearly with respect to the number of documents processed. In Figure 10 we see that the time per frequent itemset mined decreases as the minimum support level decreases. The time per candidate itemset processed was constant at about 1 msec. The decrease in time per frequent itemset mined is due to the increase in the number of candidate itemsets that become frequent itemsets as the minimum support level rlecreases 5 Conclusions The main conclusions that can be drawn from this study are centered around the nature of the text databases and the use of the mined association rules The distribution of words in text document collections Minimum Support  Proceedings of the 14th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI\22202 1082-3409/02 $17.00 \251 2002 IEEE

shows a pattern similar to the CPU cost as in the previous experiments During the experiments we observed that queries having a close nearest neighbor were processed fast using both structures whereas for cases with distant neighbors the SG\226tree was signi\036cantly faster than the SG\226table We validated this observation by running 1000 queries on the T30.I18.D200K dataset and averaging the query costs for various distance ranges of the nearest neighbor Figure 12 shows the average pruning an d CPU cost for 036ve distance ranges When the distance is small search is fast for both methods actually for distances in the range 1\2263 the SG\226 table outperforms the SG\226tree However the distant cases are handled much faster by the SG\226tree showing that this access method is more robust to 221outlier\222 queries As a general conclusion from this set of experiments the SG\226tree is a more ef\036cient and robust access method than the SG\226table in addition to its other inherent advantages dynamic data handling independence to hard-wired constants In the next subsection we compare the indexes for other query types on both synthetic and real data 5.4 Real data nd other queries Figures 13 and 14 show the performance of the indexes for 000 NN queries on the T30.I18.D200K synthetic dataset and the CENSUS dataset respectively for various values of 000  The results for each experimental instance were averaged over 100 queries In both 036gures for small to medium values of 000 the SG\226tree is signi\036cantly faster than the SG\226 table When 000 is large  001 003 005 005 005  the fraction of the data that need to be visited becomes too large for the indexes to be useful This is due to the fact that the search space becomes less appropriate for search For example when 000 t 003 005 005 005 005 we observed that the average distance of the 000 th neighbor is very large 31.81 for T30.I18.D200K and 18.06 for CENSUS and very close to the average distance of all transactions from f  This is due to the 221dimensionality curse\222 effect 3 o ften o b s erv e d i n h ig h d i men s io n a l search problems Observe that the SG\226tree is less sensitive to this effect since its performance degenerates at a smaller pace especially for the real dataset We also compared the indexes for similarity range queries Figures 15 and 16 The same datasets and queries as before are used and the distance threshold from the query varies from 2 to 10 For r t 020  the SG\226table outperforms the SG\226tree on the synthetic dataset In all other cases the tree is much faster Observe that on the real dataset in particular for both 000 NN queries and range queries the performance difference quite large in favor of the tree This indicates that the structure can perform very well in real life cases  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 10 100 1000 10000 k-nn search varying k T30.I18.D200K  o f d ata p rocessed 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 time\(msec SG-table\(%data SG-tree\(%data SG-table\(time SG-tree\(time Figure 13 021 NN queries T30.I18.D200K 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 10 100 1000 10000 k-nn search varying k CENSUS  o f d ata p rocessed 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 tim e m sec SG-table\(%data SG-tree\(%data SG-table\(time SG-tree\(time Figure 14 022 NN queries CENSUS 5.5 Dynamic data changes In this experiment we compare the structures simulating a case where the nature of the data changes dynamically We generated a synthetic dataset T10.I6.D100K and built an SG\226table and SG\226tree for it We then gradually updated the structures by inserting batches of 100K transactions each with the same characteristics i.e T=10 I=6 but putting different seeds to the random generator i.e the large itemsets used were different for each batch We ran nearest neighbor queries on the two structures after each insertion phase The queries for phase 023 after batch 023 has been inserted 024 026 023 026 032  are generated as follows For each query i a random number 033 from 1 to 023 is chosen and ii the generator parameters i.e large itemsets for batch 033 are used to produce the query For example a query for the phase where the dataset contains 300K data is generated using randomly one of the generators of batches 1 2 or 3 Figure 17 shows the average pruning ef\036ciency and CPU time of the two structures Initially both have similar performance but as more data with different characteristics are inserted into the structures the performance of the SG\226table degenerates since it is optimized for the 036rst 100K data  84  Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE\22203 1063-6382/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE
