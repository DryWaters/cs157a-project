That is, item 1 and item 2 never appear toge ther, and they are mutual exclusive! This situation almost never happens in the normal database. The attackers may interest in this situation and infer that {1, 2} is hidden deliberately. To hide the sensitive patterns, only need to make their supports smaller than minimum support and need not to decrease their support to 0. To solve the problem, we inject a probability ? which is called Distortion probability into this approach. Distortion probability is used only when the column j of the sanitization matrix S contains only one  1  i.e. Sjj = 1 0 1 d   m k k j i k  S D  m j n i j i  d d d d   1  1     D  i j  h a s   j probability to be set to 1 and 1  j probability to be set to 0 Lemma 1: Given a minimum support ?, and a level of confidence c.

Sanitization Algorithm Fig.7: Sanitization Algorithm According to the probability policies discussed above, the sanitization algorithm D'n  m = Dn  m  Sm  m is showed in Fig.7 Notice that, if the sanitization process causes all the entries in row r of D' equal to 0, randomly choose an entry from some j Proceedings of the 29th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference  COMPSAC  05 0730-3157/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE where Drj = 1, and set D'rj = 1. It is to guarantee that the size of the sanitized database equals the size of the original database 4. Performance Evaluation 4.1. Performance Quantifying There are three potential errors in the problem. First of all some sensitive patterns are hidden unsuccessfully. Secondly some non-sensitive patterns cannot be mined from D'. And the third, new artificial patterns may be produced. However, the third condition never happens in both of our approach and SWA Besides, we also introduce the other two criteria, dissimilarity and weakness. All of the criteria are discussed as follows Criterion 1: some sensitive patterns are frequent in D'. This condition is denoted as Hiding Failure [10], and measured by     DP DP HF H H , where XPH represents the number of patterns contained in PHwhich is mined from database X Criterion 2: some non-sensitive patterns are hidden in D'. It is also denoted as Misses Cost [10], and measured by      DP DPDP MC 


MC H H H      w h e r e        X P H  r e p r e s s ents the number of patterns contained in ~PH which is mined from database X Criterion 3: the dissimilarity between the original and the sanitized database is also concerned, and it is measured by      n i m j ij n i m j ijij D DD Dis 1 1 1 1    Criterion 4: according to the previous section, Forward Inference Attack is avoided while at least one pair-subpattern of a sensitive pattern is hidden. The attack is quantified by        DPDP DPairSDPDP Weakness HH HH    where DPairS is the set of sensitive patterns whose pair subsets can be completely mined from D 4.2. Experimental Results Table 1: Experiment factor The experiment is to compare the performance between our approach and SWA which has been compare with Algo2a [4 and IGA [10] and is so far the algorithm with best performances published and presented in [12] as we know. The IBM synthetic data generator is used to generate experimental data. The dataset contains 1000 different items, with 100K transactions where the average length of each transaction is 15 items. The Apriori algorithm with minimum support = 1% is used to mine the dataset and 52964 frequent patterns are gotten Several sensitive patterns are randomly selected from the frequent patterns with length two to three items to be seeds With the several seeds, all of their supersets are included into the sensitive patterns set since any pattern which contains sensitive patterns should also be sensitive 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.0205 0.04 0.0618 0.0855 0.1006 ratio of sensitive pattern H id

RS and weakness Fig.8, Fig.9, Fig.10, Fig.11 and Fig.12 show the effect of RS by comparing our work to SWA. Refer to Fig.8, because the level of confidence in our sanitization process takes the minim um support into account, no matter how the distribution of the sensitive patterns, we still are C confident to avoid hiding failure problems. However, there is no correlation between the disclos ure threshold in SWA and the minimum support. Under the sa me disclosure threshold, if the frequencies of the sensitive patte rns are high, the hiding failure will get high too. In Fig.9, beca use our work is to hide the sensitive patterns by decreasing the supports of the pair-subpatterns of the sensitive patterns, the val ue of weakness is related to the level of confidence. However according to the disclosure threshold of SWA, when all the pair subpatterns of the sensitive patterns have large frequencies, it may cause serious F-I Attack problems.

However if the sensitive pattern set is composed of too many seeds, a lot of victim pair-subpatterns will be contained in Marked-Set. And as a result, cause a higher misses cost, such as x = 0.04 in Fig.10 Moreover, refer to the turning points of SWA under x = 0.0855 to 0.1006 in Fig.10 and Fig.11. The reason of violation is that the result of the experiment has strong correlation with the distri bution of the sensitive patterns. Because the sensitive patterns Proceedings of the 29th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference  COMPSAC  05 0730-3157/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE are chosen randomly, several variant factors of the sensitive patt erns are not under control such as the frequencies of the sensiti ve patterns and the overlap between the sensitive patterns if the overlap between the sensitive patterns is high, some sensitive patterns can be hidden by removing a common item in SWA Therefore, decrease the misses cost and the dissimilarity 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 0.0205 0.04 0.0618 0.0855 0.1006 ratio of sensitive pattern E x ec u ti o n T im e h  SP SWA 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.3784 0.6392 0.7646 0.9081 1 ratio of large2 in sensitive pattern set H id in g F a il u re SP SWA 


SWA Fig.12: Rel. bet. RS and time. Fig.13: Rel. bet. RL2 and HF Fig.12 shows the execution time of SWA and our approach As shown in the result, the execution time of SWA increases as RS increases. On the other hand, our approach can be separated roughly into two parts, one is to get Marked-Set which is strong dependent on the data, the other is to set sanitization matrix and execute multiplication whose execution time is dependent on the numbers of transactions and items in the database. In the experi ment, because the items and transactions are fixed, therefore, the execution time of our approach is decided by the setting of Marked-Set which makes the execution time changing slightly 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.3784 0.6392 0.7646 0.9081 1 ratio of large2 in sensitive pattern set W ea k n es s SP SWA 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.3784 0.6392 0.7646 0.9081 1 ratio of large2 in sensitive pattern set M is se s C o st SP SWA Fig.14: Rel. bet.

RL2 and Dis Fig.13, Fig.14, Fig.15and Fig.16 show the effect of RL2 Refer to Fig.13 and Fig.14, our work outperforms SWA no matter what RL2 is. And our process is almost 0% hiding failure 


The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
