validation is one of the most problematic steps in an association rule discovery process. In order to find relevant knowledge for decision-making, the user needs to really rummage through the rules. Visualization can be very beneficial to support him/her in this task by improving the intelligibility of the large rule sets and enabling the user to navigate inside them. In this article we propose to answer the association rule validation problem by designing a human-centered visualization method for the rule rummaging task. This new approach based on a specific rummaging model relies on rule interestingness measures and on interactive rule subset focusing and mining. We have implemented our 
representation by developing a first experimental prototype called ARVis  1. Introduction  Among the knowledge models used in Knowledge Discovery in Databases \(KDD  become a major concept and received significant research attention. These rules are implicative tendencies of the form X 001 Y where X and Y are conjunctions of database items \(boolean variables\problematic steps in an association rule discovery process is the post 
processing of the rules, i.e. the interpretation, evaluation and validation of the rules after their extraction. Indeed the data mining algorithms can produce enormous amounts of rules. In practice, it is very tedious for the user a decision-maker specialized in the data studied interesting knowledge for decision-making in a corpus that can hold hundreds of thousands of rules or even millions of rules with large business databases. This problem is due to the unsupervised nature of association rule discovery: the user does not make his/her goals explicit and does not specify any endogenous variable Three kinds of approaches aim at helping the user appropriate the bulks of association rules: reducing the 
number of rules with interestingness measures [13] or  rules with interactive tools like rule browsers [9] or query languages  and visualizing the rule sets with visual representations like matrices or graphs [6 In this article, to apprehend the problem of rule validation, we have opted for defining the user's task as a prerequisite Indeed in order to efficiently assist the user in his/her search for the interesting knowledge, the KDD process should be considered not from the point of view of the discovery algorithms but from that of the user's, as a usercentered and 
From the definition of the user's task and the cognitive constraints which ensue, we propose an appropriate model of rule rummaging which follows from our previous works  we present an interactive visualization method for the humancentered process of association rule rummaging. This method combines the three approaches described before with a tight association of interestingness measures, a strong interactivity with the user, and a visual representation. We have implemented our new visualization method in a first rule mining prototype called ARVis. Including an online algorithm of rule extraction, ARVis allows the user to mine the rules 
interactively via the visual representation all along the rummaging process In the next part we define the user's task and our model for the human-centered rummaging of association rules Then we present our interactive visualization method and the choices we made for ARVis regarding the rule set structure, the visual metaphor, and the interactions  2. Human-centered rummaging of association rules  2.1. User's task  During the knowledge validation step in the post 
processing of the rules, the user is faced with the rules extracted by data mining algorithms and described by interestingness measures. The user's task is then to find interesting rules for decision-making in these long lists Inspired by research works on the user's behavior in a knowledge discovery process [2] on the one hand, and Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


also by cognitive principles of information processing in  hand we consider that the user applies a focusing strategy to apprehend the bulk of rules: faced with a large amount of information, the user focuses his/her attention on a limited and therefore more intelligible subset of potentially useful information. To facilitate the user's post-processing task we have developed a model of human-centered rummaging which supports his/her focusing strategy by allowing to isolate a rule subset, to explore it, and to change it in an iterative way until he/she is able to reach a decision  2.2. Rule rummaging model  Our rule rummaging model consists in letting the user navigate as he/she wishes through the voluminous rule set by focusing on the successive limited subsets to explore The user drives a series of local explorations by trial and error through the whole rule set from which only the selected portion is gradually visited. Implementing such a rule rummaging process implies structuring the rule set to allow the user to focus on rule subsets and navigate from one to another. More precisely, we need to group the rules together into subsets and combine these subsets among themselves by neighborhood relations \(figure 1 navigation step, to access a new rule subset after exploring the current one, the user has the choice among all the neighboring subsets, i.e. those reachable by the neighborhood relation. This relation can be implemented by a retrieval procedure if the rule set is already extracted post-analysis of rules\or by a local algorithm for constraint-based rule extraction \(inductive database approach interactively from the rummaging process  Figure 1. The neighborhood relation allows to mine the rule subsets according to the user's navigation   3. Visualization for rule rummaging in the ARVis tool  In this part, we describe the choices we made to implement the human-centered rummaging process in ARVis. The rules are here described by three interestingness measures: support, confidence [1], and implication intensity \(respectively noted sp  cf and ii  Support evaluates the generality of the rules and confidence its validity \(success rate intensity evaluates the rule statistical surprisingness by quantifying the unlikelihood of the number of counterexamples compared to a probabilistic model [3 Each measure is associated to a minimal threshold set by the user and exploited to filter the rules s sp  s cf  s ii   3.1. Relation of specialization/generalization  Given the set I of items relative to the studied domain the rules are of the form X 001 y where X is an itemset X 001  I and y is an item y  002  I  X We have chosen to structure the rule set by creating rule subsets RULES\(X  each corresponding to an itemset X  001  I Each subset RULES\(X contains two kinds of rules, the specific ones RULESspe\(X and the general ones RULESgen\(X  RULES\(X    RULESspe\(X  003  RULESgen\(X    Figure 2.

adding an item to the itemset X whereas an item is removed by generalizing  3.2. Quality-oriented visual metaphor  To generate a visual representation of the rules, we take advantage of the user's focusing strategy by only representing the current subset at each navigation step Each rule subset is visualized using a 3D "information landscape" representation. With the use of 3D instead of 2D, the most important information can be displayed in the foreground, letting the less important information in the background. For each rule subset, the landscape is shared into two areas: one is dedicated to the specific rules, and the other one to the general rules Figure 3. Two arenas in a landscape  We symbolize each rule by the following object: a sphere perched on top of a cone in the landscape. In the specific rule and the general rule areas, the objects are laid-out in the landscape on an arena \(a "glass" half-bowl to reduce occultation \(figure 3\for the following visual metaphor to represent the rule subsets figure 4 the object position represents the implication intensity the sphere visible area represents the support the cone height represents the confidence the object color is used redundantly to represent a weighted average of the three measures This visual metaphor stresses the good rules whose visualization and access are made easier compared to the worse rules. Furthermore, some complementary text labels appear above each object to give the name of the corresponding rule and provide the numerical values for support, confidence and implication intensity  3.3. Interactions  The user interacts in three different ways with the visual representation: by visiting the rule subsets, by filtering the rules on the interestingness measures, and by navigating among the subsets The user can wander freely over the 3D landscape to browse the rules and examine them more closely. To facilitate the user's exploration, there exist predefined viewpoints for the overall vision of each arena and for the close vision of each object During the subset local explorations, the user can filter the rules in the landscape by dynamic queries on the interestingness measures via sliders. These queries alter the thresholds s sp  s cf  s ii on the measures to make only the rules with sufficient quality appear Finally, to drive his/her rummaging process, the user can navigate from one rule subset to another by clicking on the objects in the landscape. By clicking on a specific respectively general X 001 x he/she triggers the relation of specialization \(resp. generalization subset is thus replaced by the new more specific subset RULES\(X 003 x resp. the new more general subset RULES\(X  the more specific or more general subsets the user can reach are represented in a shrunk version inside the spheres of the current landscape. This allows to anticipate whether a subset is worth exploring or not The relations of specialization/generalization are implemented using the hybrid mining algorithm presented in The first step of this algorithm is the "frequent itemset" mining procedure of the well-known A Priori  algorithm procedure polynomial in number of items which dynamically computes the rule subsets RULES\(X  Therefore, only the rules required by the user along his/her rummaging process are extracted  4. Conclusion   In this paper, we have presented an interactive visualization method specially designed to support association rule mining and post-processing in a KDD process. This new approach is based on our humancentered model of rule rummaging appropriate to the user's task. It enables him/her to navigate through the voluminous rule set by carrying out a series of local explorations of limited subsets he/she focuses on. The user can thus comprehend the bulk of rules more easily to find relevant knowledge for decision-making. Coupled with an online algorithm of rule extraction, the visualization allows to interactively drive the data mining by producing only the rules required by the user. The subjectivity present in the rule validation step can thus be exploited in the KDD process to reduce the rule profusion Moreover, our visualization takes advantage of the rules names, used in the interactions to navigate among the subsets, but also of the interestingness measures highlighted in the representation, which is original compared to the other rule set visualization methods We have developed ARVis, a first rule mining prototype implementing our visualization method.

is built on a client/server architecture. On the server side a CGI program takes charge of the local extraction of the rules and of the visual representation construction in VRML. The rules and the 3D landscapes are therefore generated dynamically. On the client side, the user visualizes the landscapes with a web browser equipped with a relevant VRML plug-in. The tool can be used with shutterglasses to provide stereoscopic display in order to improve the perception of depth. Our future works will mainly concern developing the tool for rule rummaging in Java3D implementing additional neighborhood relations with appropriate local mining algorithms                      5.

In the considered application scenario, exploiting the inherent hierarchical structure of the MeSH taxonomy is a natural extension of our method. Hierarchies allow association rules mining at multiple abstraction levels that can be exploited for the generation of query expansions that take into account correlations that are stronger than those discovered with the current MTA approach Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank dr.

A frequency tree example After we built a frequency tree, we then use the Quick-split technique to calculate the maximal frequent sets The Quick-split algorithm is given here Input: A frequency tree r Output: An array of BitSets representing Itemsets Quick-split\(Tree r 1: if\(r is leaf   2: for all x E r.subs do 3: subres[x] = Quick-split\(x x 4: result =newBSO 5: for all x E r.subs do 6: result = result &amp; subres[x 7: remove b E result, b.size:::; k 8: return result To speed up calculation, an itemset is represented by a bitset with 0 and I for specifying the absence or presence of an item at a corresponding position respectively. The Quick-split performs a calculation on a frequency tree and returns an array of bitsets, which represent a group of decomposed itemsets. Splitting is accomplished by calculating bitset results in a bottom  up fashion in the tree. In the above example, we have 8 items a, b, . . .  , h corresponding to positions 0-7 in a 8bit bitset. So p.JS = abcdefgh = {I III I Ill}; abcd ll1 10000}; bcdefgh = {OllillII}. The size of the bitset is the number of items in p.JS which is usually much smaller than the total item size in the dataset For the frequency tree in Figure 2, for the itemset abcdefgh and infrequent 3-itemsets {aef, aeg, aeh, afg ajh, agh, abe, abf, abg, abh, ace, acf, acg, ach, ade adf, adg, adh} , Quick-split returns the possible maximal frequent sets {abcd, bcdefgh The PD Algorithm Input: transaction dataset T Output: frequent patterns PD \( transaction-set T I : D 1 = {&lt;t, 1&gt;1 t E T}; k= I 2: while \(Dk   3: for all p E Dk do II counting 4: for all k-itemset s c;;; p.JS do 5: Sup\(s IDk 6: decide Lk and ?Lk Ilbuild Dk 7: Dk+]= PD-rebuild\(Dk, Lk , ?Lk 8: k 9: end 10: Answer = u Lk As shown above, PD is the top-level function that accepts a transaction dataset as its input and returns the union of all frequent sets as the result.

Note that qk is not used here for decomposing p. In steps 5 to 9, we use pattern separation rule to separate p. In steps 7 to 9 PD-rebuild merges the patterns separated from p with their identical ones via a hash table ht. Since PD follows the pattern decomposition rule to decompose patterns and the pattern separation rule for merging identical patterns that yield same support, the answers generated by PD are correct 3. Comparative Study Our experiments were performed on a 600 MHz Pentium PC machine with 256 MB main memory running on Microsoft Windows XP. All three algorithms were written in C++ language. The test dataset was generated in the same fashion as the IBM Quest project . We used dataset T25.I10.DIOOK . In the dataset, the number of items N was set to 1000. The corruption level for a seed large itemset was fixed obtained from a normal distribution with mean 0.5 and variance 0.1. In the dataset, half of all items were corruptible. In the dataset, the average transaction size ITI and average maximal potentially frequent itemset size III are set to 25 and 10, respectively, while the number of transactions IDI in the dataset is set to lOOK 3.1. Comparison of PD with DCP  Pattern Decomposition algorithm does not need to generate candidate sets which are the main improvement on DCP; the reduced dataset contains only itemsets whose subsets are all frequent  PD generates all frequent sets whether it is not certain in DCP. PD significantly reduces the dataset in each pass by reducing the number of transactions and their size to give better performance. So counting time is clearly less than DCP in a reduced dataset  PD is much more scalable than the DCP 8000 7000 6000 5000 lt;.i OOO E f OOO 2000 Minimum Support PD DCP Figure 3.

Figure 3 shows the execution times for different minimum support. We can see that PD is about 15 times faster than DCP with minimal support at 2% and about 8 times faster than DCP at 0.25%. In Figure 4, to test the scalability with the number of transactions experiments on dataset D are used. The support threshold is set to 0.75 3.2. Comparison of PD with PIP  Predictive item pruning FP-tree algorithm has a complicated data structure in comparison to PD algorithm  PD works by decomposing transactions into short itemsets. Then regular patterns are combined together. Hence data set is being reduced at every pass. As a result, space efficiency is improved. On the other hand, PIP FP-tree, although prunes infrequent items, its hit ratio is not as efficient as PD. So, obviously its space efficiency is not better than PD  As PD always concerns with the current data set less time is required in comparison to PIP FP-tree algorithm  PD is more scalable than the PIP 100r  E F  60 40 0 20 PD  PIP Minimum Support Figure 5.

But PIP takes substantially more time when minimum support in the range from 0.6% to 2%. When minimum support is less than 0.6%, the number of frequent patterns increased quickly and thus the execution times are comparable. In Figure 6, we compared the scalability of PD with PIP on the dataset D with minimum support = 0.75%. PD was clearly more scalable than that of PIP 4. Conclusion The programs were implemented in C++ very efficiently. Since really large datasets or data warehouse was not available for us, we run the programs of these three algorithms by using test datasets. So performance comparisons are not the absolute values. The results can vary on other 


absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type. The pattern-covering operator, denoted as ?p\(c,D all patterns in c representing D. More formally p\(c,D t.a1, ..., t.an true Note that: ?p\(c,D p,D 6. Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
