Analyzing the Inîuential People in Sina Weibo Dataset Qing Liao   Wei Wang  YiHan   Qian Zhang   Department of Computer Science and Engineering Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Hong Kong  qnature gswwang qianzh  ust.hk  Department of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science Peking University Beijing yihan@pku.edu.cn Abstract With the increasingly rapid growth of micro 
blogging services inîuence analysis is becoming a very important topic in this area Sina Weibo one of the largest mirco-blogging services in China has provided a new operation comment-only  which allows users to give feedback on a post without forwarding However most of existing works focus on Twitter which fail to consider this new operation In paper we propose a new inîuence measurement method called WeiboRank on Sina Weibo which applies comment-only operation to help researchers to nd ignored inîuential users who have big inîuential in comment dimension Furthermore we analyze why a particular user is inîuential based on tracing the source of inîuence to nd out 
which aspects contribute to inîuence Our experiments based on a subset of a whole Sina Weibo datatset which includes three-month records of 22,514,394 users We conduct extensive experiments and results show that we can accurately nd the most inîuential individuals among entire social networks while the running time of the algorithm increases linearly with any increase in data size which is suitable for large scale networks I I NTRODUCTION Nowadays micro-blogging services such as Twitter Google and Sina Weibo have become an important way to keep up with the news and exchange information It not only provides a new way to collect huge data set that reîects 
behaviour patterns of users in large scale networks but also affects people in the real world Twitter as the original mircoblogging service has been studied for the past several years Besides Twitter a similar platform called Sina Weibo one of the Chinas largest micro-blogging services gained 200 million registered users from August 2009 to August 2011 Studies on the properties of micro-blogging formed by user relationships and interactions have attracted much interest Analyzing the social inîuence of celebrities in online social networks OSNs has attracted many researchers This is mainly due to the many beneìts such as helping us to better understand what the latest trends are and how advertising can be more effective in the 
online commercial eld There are several methods to measure inîuence based on different online platforms in particular Twitter  However there are several limitations to these previous works First Sina Weibo exclusively provides a new operation called comment-only so that existing works are not suitable for this platform Second previous works have mainly focused on the accuracy of identifying inîuential users and the efìciency of the algorithm while they do not theoretically analyze why a particular user is important In order to overcome the above two shortcomings we propose a inîuence measurement called WeiboRank which 
considers comment-only Comment-only can reîect the information feeback ability which Twitter cannot Furthermore the comment-only operation can avoid follower-buying and retweet-buying where two business cases can purchase some accounts to follow a particular user or retweet others tweet to build a fake social inîuence WeiboRank consists of two parts a single-dimension inîuential measurement and identifying inîuence people via Skyline In the rst part we devise a inîuential measurement method based on PageRank to evaluate the inîuence under a single dimension and in the second part we leverage Skyline to e xtend the inîuence result into follow repost and comment dimensions to help identify inîuential people in the Sina Weibo dataset Then 
we introduce a new concept called dependence to trace the source of inîuence Tracing the source of inîuence helps us to understand why a particular user is inîuential as we discover which factors and users contribute to the inîuence To the best of our knowledge this is the rst work that analyzes the social inîuence with the consideration of commentonly The contributions of this paper are threefold  We based on the real dataset to compare the differences between Twitter and Sina Weibo and study the relationship between comment repost and follow through qualitative and quantitative aspects We show that existing methods for Twitter are not suitable for Sina Weibo 
 We propose a novel method called WeiboRank which considers the new operation comment to help researchers to evaluate the inîuence score to nd the undervalued inîuential users based on Sina Weibo Moreover our method combines comment follower and repost three dimensions together to generate the nal inîuential users  We analyze why a particular user is important based on tracing the source of inîuence in the real Sina Weibo dataset which includes 22,514,394 userês record in three

a Retweet in Twitter b Reply in Twitter c Three operations in Sina Weibo Fig 1 Operations on Twitter vs Sina Weibo months The results show that different users have different inîuential source and verify again that the source of repost inîuence and comment inîuence is different The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section II presents observations on Sina Weibo vs Twitter and states the problem Details about the novel inîuence measurement method called WeiboRank discussed in Section III Section IV analyzes why a particular user is inîuential based on tracing its source of inîuence In Section V the experimental results show that we can nd most of the inîuential individuals in the Sina Weibo Some related work is listed in Section VI Finally we summarize the paper in Section VII and discuss future work II P RELIMINARIES A Sina Weibo vs Twitter In Twitter there are only two types of operations provided  retweet retransmit the original tweet to their followers  reply respond to or comment to others tweets as long as retweeting Users can retweet or reply a tweet as shown in Figure 1\(a and 1\(b Both retweet and reply operations retransmit the original tweet which means if a user retweets or replies to a tweet his or her followers can receive the original tweet In Sina Weibo three types of operations are provided  repost-only  similar to retweet in Twitter  repost-and-comment  similar to reply in Twitter  98 A B a Inîuence Score With Node A 58   A B b Inîuence Score Without Node A Fig 2 Inîuence Score of Node B  comment-only  similar to reply in Twitter but without retweeting As shown in Figure 1\(c Sina Weibo allows users to comment and repost at the same time If a user does not choose the repost-and-comment operation the user will do repost-only or comment-only operations Both Repost and Repost-andcomment retransmit the original post which operates similarly to Twitter However Sina Weibo has comment-only If the user adopts this new operation the comment will only show under the original post as in the bottom of Figure 1\(c and that userês followers are unable to access the comment and original post The comment-only operation is the key difference between Sina Weibo and Twitter because Twitter does not distinguish between the effects of retransmission and the comment operation Repost and comment are two different ways to transmit information in Sina Weibo however the repost operation is mainly focused on the retransmission of information It also has a stronger ability to diffuse information However the comment operation mainly focused on the feedback ability and communication ability of information B Problem Deìnition There are two deìnitions which need to be declared before we state the problem 1 Evaluating Social Inîuence In our work we consider the new operation comment-only and adopt Page Rank to evaluate inîuence in Sina Weibo 2 Tracing the Source of Inîuence Some scholars exploit entities social inîuence by analyzing the topological structure Such inîuence can be considered as the social standing of entities is usually measured by scoring functions Different vertices in a social network may have different scoring function values However what makes such difference in values Example 1 Figure 2\(b represents the induced subgraph of Figure 2\(a by voiding the links connecting to B  The labeled number on vertices represents the a link-based authority measure In order to analyze the dependency from A to B we separate the vertex A from the network by disconnecting its links If A can effect the inîuence score of B  we say that A is one of the sources of inîuence on B  If edge  A  B  was disconnected the inîuential score B decrease dramatically We say there has a strong interdependency between A and B  Otherwise we say that is has a weak relationship We consider that A is one of the sources of the B s inîuence Such situation is quite common in Sina Weibo For instance a famous user A may not public posts by himself but repost

user u to v  if user v has a comment on the post of user u  A  V  R is the inîuence measurement function which maps the node set to the set of real numbers Since we consider that the same Weibo user can reîect different aspects of social inîuence depending on the angles it is viewed from We choose A f  v  which represents the inîuence value of user v under the f dimension which can be follow repost and comment dimensions Deìnition 1 Top-k Queries Finding k persons that have the highest overall scores A f is the inîuence measurement function and in our work we choose PageRank-like as A f  The formulation of singledimension inîuence measurement in Sina Weibo is shown as follows A f  u     v  M  u  A f  v  L  v   3 where  is the constant to ensure that the result is not negative Where M  u   v  u v  E  represents the neighbour of user v  and L  v  means the number of outlinks which user v has In Sina Weibo L  v  presents the number of received posts We randomly assign a score value to each node in the graph and then apply the above equation 3 iteratively until the inîuence scores converge C Identifying Inîuential People via Skyline The above subsection introduces a single-dimension inîuence measurement through the PageRank-like method In this subsection we describe how to combine a multi-dimension result together to return the nal result Some existed works depend on one dimension such as follower or retweet to evaluate inîuential users  Another pre vious w ork 7 which considers two dimensions but they cannot decide a reasonable weight in their work In our work we choose R-tree as the data structure which can organize multi-dimensional data by representing the data by a minimum bounding box And based on the Skyline method to combine the threedimension follow repost and comment and to avoid any dimension weight decision The deìnition of Skyline is shown below Deìnition 2 Domination For two vertices u v  V  u dominates v  denoted by u  v if  f  F  A f  u  012A f  u   and not all the three equalities hold Deìnition 3 Skyband In the Weibo network G   V E   a vertex v  V is a m-skyline vertex if there exists no other m vertices u  V such that u  v  m-skyband computation is a kind of query  which returns all m-skyband vertices IV T RACING THE S OURCE OF I NFLUENCE The previous section describes how to evaluate a userês inîuence and in this section we analyze why a particular user is inîuential We also propose a new concept dependence to trace the source of the inîuence In Figure 5 h represents the induced subgraph of G Figure 5 by voiding the links connecting to a  In order to analyze the dependency of a vertex we separate the vertex from the network by disconnecting its links instead of deleting it In Table I the rst row shows the PageRank-like scores of vertices in graph G  A G  v  is the inîuence measurement score of v in G  G v represents the induced subgraph of G by separating vertex v  Apparently if a  b or c are separated from G  e s pagerank-like score does not change a lot However if f  g or h are separated from G  e s pagerank-like score changes to greater than 50 even f and g are not connected to e directly Intuitively for a vertex v  if a substructure is separated from the original network and v s authority changes a lot v can be regarded closely dependant on this substructure Deìnition 4 Dependency Given a four-tuple set G   V E F A  and an individual u v  G  V   we deìne the dependence dep  u  v  from u to v as dep  u  v og A  v G  A  v G u   4 dep  u  v  shows the ratio of the importance of v and the original score when graph G is disconnected from u  G u denotes the induced subgraph of G  u  and A  v G  denotes the importance value of an individual v in network G  A  V  R   when dep  u  v   A  v G u  A  v G   hence u  v does not have dependence when dep  u  v   0  the dependence is positive otherwise it is negative For an individual u  if removing a part of the network signiìcantly affects the importance of v wesay v is highly dependent on that part and this dependence can be considered to be a standard of the analysis of why a particular user is important We can also analyze the relationship between nodes the higher the dependence the closer the relationship and vice versa

ID:1266321801 TABLE III T HE R ESULTS OF I NFLUENCE R ANKONTHE O PERATION N ETWORKS B Dependence Analysis We choose two famous users user A and user B in Sina Weibo to analyze their dependence rank under a repost network As shown in Figure 7 there are a few particular users have a very high dependence scores compared to user B which means a strong relationship exists among a few particular users to user B  If we break the connections between user B and these important and inîuential source users the inîuence of user B will decrease a lot However user A as shown in Figure 6 is not affected a lot under the same circumstances Figure 8 and 9 present the dependence results under repost and comment dimensions and each node represents a Sina Weibo user We nd that some users who have high repost ranks may have a low comment dependence score which means even for the same user the dependent users have different dependence ranks under different dimensions Figure 10 and Figure 11 show that a set of users who have the same comment dependence score has a large rang of repost dependence score It veriìes again that repost and comment have weak correlations and different operations cannot replace each other C Efìciency of Algorithm To validate the efìciency and scalability of WeiboRank we use several subsets with different numbers of users in a high-dimension environment where d=1 means WeiboRank runs in the follower network d=2 means WeiboRank runs in the follower and repost networks and d=3 means WeiboRank runs in follower repost and comment network The results are shown in Figure 12 We nd that with the increasing data size the running time of the algorithm also increases linearly The calculation time of each subset is proportional to dimension d  The larger the value of d  the larger the dominated space we need to search and thus the longer the runtime Based on the above analysis the algorithm is effective and scaleable which is suitable for large scale networks and parallel processing VI C ONCLUSION This work studies the inîuence of online social network services from two aspects First we proposed a novel method called WeiboRank based on PageRank-like and Skyline to evaluate inîuential users on a novel dataset Sina Weibo Then we traced the source of inîuence under three-operation networks follow repost and comment We also compared the differences between Sina Weibo and Twitter through quantitative analysis to prove that existing Twitter work does not relate     Fig 12 Run Time of WeiboRank to Sina Weibo Experimental results show that our method can nd the most inîuential users among previous inîuence evaluation methods by considering all available aspects How to use dependence analysis to nd the retweet-buying case will be researched more deeply and we will extend our work to the topic level in the future A CKNOWLEDGEMENT The research was support in part by grants from RGC under the contracts CERG 622410 HKUST grant SRFI11FYT01

particularly given that some of our workload will be portalbased user-services for whom different metrics of service and performance will be necessary There is a tension here between the constraints of working with a shared massively parallel le system and massively scalable compute We believe the scale of our upgrades will both allow us to serve the user communities and to explore both sides of this debate Whatever the workîow users settle on whether batch or cloud orientated most will have to make signiìcant improvements to their workîow to exploit massive parallelisation We have presented an example of how such workîows can be developed within a constrained virtual environment before exploiting massive batch computing but thus far these sort of interventions are very resource intensive We do not have the resources to intervene on such a scale for most users and we do not yet have suitable documentation in place to help users develop their own solutions To that end we are also procuring improvements in documentation and training materials V S UMMARY We have presented the JASMIN architecture rst year of usage and near term plans The physical architecture consists of 600 cores and 5 PB of fast disk connected by low latency networking The compute environment supports a range of virtualisation options from batch to cloud computing A diverse and growing user community is exploiting JASMIN examples include high resolution climate modelling and whole satellite mission analysis for cloud and land surface retrievals The use of Panasas for storage has been very successful with exibility reliability and low management overheads being key to that success However the existing JASMIN environment is underpowered in compute the storage is lling and difìculties exporting the high performance disk into the local VMware cloud computing environment remain JASMIN users are becoming accustomed to a new analysis environment and early adopters are getting signiìcant improvements in their workîow completely changing the nature of the science they can undertake However thus far the JASMIN support team has not yet been able to invest in comprehensive user documentation or training so not all the community has seen the beneìts of these investments To fully exploit JASMIN changes in software and workîow will be necessary for most users and these will take time to engender Recognising the limitations with the existing physical infrastructure and with new user communities anticipated hardware software and documentation will all be upgraded over the next two years R EFERENCES  B N La wrence V  Bennett J Churchill M Juck es P  K ersha w  P Oliver M Pritchard and A Stephens The JASMIN super-datacluster ArXiv e-prints  Apr 2012  K E T aylor  R  J  Stouf fer

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
